<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given with corticosteroids does not improve the benefit of corticosteroids on the lungs of babies born too early, and may increase harm.
<ABS> Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are at risk of breathing difficulties (such as respiratory distress syndrome). TRH increases thyroid hormones in the baby and it has been thought that adding TRH to corticosteroids for women giving birth early may increase the benefit of corticosteroids on the baby's lungs.
<ABS> Therefore, based on the current available evidence, TRH is not recommended to be given to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Sensitivity analyses by trial quality, or subgroups with differing times from entry to birth, or different dose regimens of TRH, did not change these findings.

<H1> Local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question
<ABS> We wanted to compare the effect of routine shunting versus selective or no shunting during carotid endarterectomy, and to assess the effect of different methods for selection of people for shunting.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> There were significant problems with the quality of the randomised trials and, overall, the reporting of study methodology was poor.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have low oxygen levels in their blood when they are resting or when moving. Low oxygen levels are known as hypoxaemia. These patients can carry around an oxygen supply (oxygen in small cylinders, portable liquid oxygen systems or battery-powered oxygen concentrators) so that they have oxygen to breathe to make simple tasks such as getting dressed, leaving the house, doing chores or even walking around their own home easier, and to help them to breathe. This portable oxygen device is referred to as 'ambulatory oxygen.'
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We conducted this review to find out the long-term benefit of ambulatory oxygen therapy for people who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air). We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years. Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada. The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light-weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min. Final follow-up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired. However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was poor. The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported. Most studies were lacking the prepublished study plan (protocol).
<ABS> Bottom line
<ABS> From this review, it is not possible to know whether ambulatory oxygen therapy should be provided during exercise or for day-to-day activities for patients with COPD who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.

<H1> Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Sinusitis is one of the most common reasons for visiting a doctor and an estimated 20 million cases of acute sinusitis occur every year in the USA alone. There are four pairs of sinuses linked to the bony structures around the nose: maxillary, frontal, ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. In sinusitis, these membrane-lined air spaces become infected, which causes pain and discharge from the nose. Treatment options include decongestants, steroid drops or sprays, mucus-clearing drugs (mucolytics), antihistamines and antibiotics and sometimes sinus puncture and irrigation for removal of purulent secretions.
<ABS> In most cases sinusitis occurs during viral infections where antibiotics are ineffective, but the few cases that also have a bacterial infection (one or two out of every 100 patients with sinus symptoms) could benefit. Unfortunately it is difficult to distinguish between those who have a bacterial infection and those who do not. It is important to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and limit the potential for antibiotic resistance.
<ABS> This updated review compiled data from 63 separate studies that used a variety of antibiotics for simple maxillary sinus infection, i.e. non-complicated acute sinusitis in a person with a healthy immune system. Nine of the studies compared antibiotics to placebo (1915 participants; seven of the studies conducted in primary care), and 54 studies compared different classes of antibiotics. Five of the nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1058 participants found that most participants got better within two weeks, regardless of whether they received the antibiotic or not (roughly 9 out of 10 participants in antibiotic groups and 8 out of 10 in placebo groups). Although all the five studies in this main outcome were assessed as having low risk of bias, the overall evidence was assessed only as being of moderate quality (it is possible that a new large study can change the estimate). In the remaining 54 studies comparing different antibiotics (10 different comparisons), no antibiotic was found to be superior to another. The evidence is current to March 2013.
<ABS> The small benefit gained by antibiotics may be overridden by the negative effects of the drugs. In addition to patient-related adverse effects (like skin rash and gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting), side effects include the risk of increased resistance to antibiotics amongst community-acquired pathogens (bacteria).
<ABS> This review found that antibiotics will help some people a bit, but do not make a major difference to most people with acute maxillary sinusitis being treated in primary care.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups.
<RES> In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotic treatment for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Maternal infection was reduced with the use of any prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86; NNTB 34, 95% CI 24 to 63) and any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92; NNTB 47, 95% CI 31 to 119). However, caution should be exercised with this finding due to the possibility of bias shown by funnel plot asymmetry. Any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics was associated with an increase in maternal adverse drug reaction (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.54; NNTH 17, 95% CI 526 to 7).

<H1> Endometrial resection and ablation versus hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This Cochrane review concerns women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which is menstrual blood loss that a woman feels to be excessive and that often interferes with her quality of life. Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration compared endometrial resection or ablation versus hysterectomy for women with HMB. The main factors (thought to be of greatest importance) were how well each operation was able to treat the symptoms of HMB, how women felt about undergoing each operation and what the complication rates were. Additional factors studied were how long each operation took to perform, how long women took to recover from the operation and how much the operation cost the hospital and the woman herself.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgical treatments for HMB include removal or destruction of the inside lining (endometrium) of the womb (endometrial resection or ablation) and surgical removal of the whole womb (hysterectomy). Both methods are commonly offered by gynaecologists, usually but not always after a non-surgical treatment has failed to correct the problem. Endometrial resection/ablation is performed via the entrance to the womb, without the need for a surgical cut. During a hysterectomy, the uterus can be removed via a surgical cut to the abdomen, via the vagina, or via 'keyhole' surgery that involves very small surgical cuts to the abdomen (laparoscopy); this last approach is a newer way to perform hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is effective in permanently stopping HMB, but it stops fertility and is associated with all the risks of major surgery, including infection and blood loss. These risks are smaller with endometrial resection/ablation.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> A systematic review of the research comparing endometrial resection and ablation versus hysterectomy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding was most recently updated in October 2013 by researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration. After searching for all relevant studies, review authors included eight studies involving a total of 1,260 women.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are included in Cochrane reviews. RCTs are studies in which participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups, each receiving a different intervention (in this case, endometrial ablation/resection or hysterectomy). The two groups are then compared. RCTs that compared these two interventions were included in this review if they studied women with HMB who had not gone through menopause and who did not have cancer or precancer of the uterus.
<ABS> Key results and conclusions
<ABS> The review of studies revealed that endometrial ablation/resection is an effective and possibly cheaper alternative to hysterectomy with faster recovery, although retreatment with additional surgery is sometimes needed. Hysterectomy is associated with more definitive resolution of symptoms but longer operating times and greater potential for surgical complications. For both operations, women generally reported that undergoing the procedure was acceptable and that they were satisfied with their experience.
<ABS> Since laparoscopic hysterectomy has become more widely used, several of the previously described disadvantages of traditional types of hysterectomy have improved, and some outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, time to return to work and time to return to normal activities have become more comparable with those of endometrial ablation. However, laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with longer operating time than other modes of hysterectomy and requires more sophisticated surgical expertise and equipment.
<ABS> Only three of the eight trials included laparoscopic hysterectomy in their comparison. More trials in this area will be needed as this route of hysterectomy becomes more widely available.
<ABS> Identifying harms
<ABS> Both surgical treatments are considered to be generally safe, and low complication rates are reported. However, hysterectomy is associated with higher rates of infection and requirement for blood transfusion.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence reported in this review was occasionally of low quality, suggesting that further research is likely to change the result. This was the case for outcomes such as a woman’s perception of bleeding and proportion of women requiring further surgery for HMB.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight RCTs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review were identified. For two trials, the review authors identified multiple publications that assessed different outcomes at different postoperative time points for the same women.
<RES> For some outcomes (such as a woman’s perception of bleeding and proportion of women requiring further surgery for HMB), a low GRADE score was generated, suggesting that further research in these areas is likely to change the estimates.

<H1> Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We found no convincing evidence that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant difference in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women). None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of the mother having complications during pregnancy and the baby being born with low birthweight and preterm (before 37 weeks). Tobacco smoking during pregnancy is relatively common, although the trend is towards it becoming less frequent in high-income countries and more frequent in low- to middle-income countries.
<ABS> The review showed that psychosocial interventions to support women to stop smoking increased the proportion of women who stopped smoking in late pregnancy and reduced the number of low birthweight and preterm births. There did not appear to be any adverse effects from the psychosocial interventions, and three studies measured an improvement in women's psychological wellbeing.
<ABS> Increasing the frequency and duration of the intervention did not appear to increase the effectiveness. Interventions appeared to be as effective for women who were poor, as those who were not; but there is insufficient evidence that the interventions were effective for ethnic (five trials) and aboriginal women (two trials). Trials where the interventions became part of routine pregnancy care did not appear to help more women to quit, which suggests there are challenges to translating this evidence into practice.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eighty-six trials were included in this updated review, with 77 trials (involving over 29,000 women) providing data on smoking abstinence in late pregnancy.
<RES> In separate comparisons, counselling interventions demonstrated a significant effect compared with usual care (27 studies; average risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.75), and a borderline effect compared with less intensive interventions (16 studies; average RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.82). However, a significant effect was only seen in subsets where counselling was provided in conjunction with other strategies. It was unclear whether any type of counselling strategy is more effective than others (one study; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.53). In studies comparing counselling and usual care (the largest comparison), it was unclear whether interventions prevented smoking relapse among women who had stopped smoking spontaneously in early pregnancy (eight studies; average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21). However, a clear effect was seen in smoking abstinence at zero to five months postpartum (10 studies; average RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.95), a borderline effect at six to 11 months (six studies; average RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77), and a significant effect at 12 to 17 months (two studies, average RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.96), but not in the longer term. In other comparisons, the effect was not significantly different from the null effect for most secondary outcomes, but sample sizes were small.
<RES> Incentive-based interventions had the largest effect size compared with a less intensive intervention (one study; RR 3.64, 95% CI 1.84 to 7.23) and an alternative intervention (one study; RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.11).
<RES> Feedback interventions demonstrated a significant effect only when compared with usual care and provided in conjunction with other strategies, such as counselling (two studies; average RR 4.39, 95% CI 1.89 to 10.21), but the effect was unclear when compared with a less intensive intervention (two studies; average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.12).
<RES> The effect of health education was unclear when compared with usual care (three studies; average RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.59) or less intensive interventions (two studies; average RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.31).
<RES> Social support interventions appeared effective when provided by peers (five studies; average RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.19), but the effect was unclear in a single trial of support provided by partners.
<RES> The effects were mixed where the smoking interventions were provided as part of broader interventions to improve maternal health, rather than targeted smoking cessation interventions.

<H1> 5-Fluorouracil for glaucoma surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Glaucoma involves a loss of vision that may be associated with raised pressure inside the eye. When glaucoma is diagnosed, it is common to try to reduce that pressure with medical, laser or surgical procedures (trabeculectomy). Surgery does not immediately restore vision, and may involve extra vision loss in the short term. Drugs can be used to modify wound healing to improve the likelihood of the success of surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants. The evidence is current to July 2013.
<ABS> 5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery
<ABS> For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year.
<ABS> For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections.
<ABS> Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye. For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year.
<ABS> Low-dose 5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery
<ABS> Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections. No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections.
<ABS> 5-FU during surgery
<ABS> If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year.
<ABS> Side effects and complications of 5-FU during or after surgery
<ABS> Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general. In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection. This may have introduced bias into the results. Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious.
<ABS> The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems. There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation. However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We contacted trial investigators for missing information. Data were summarised using risk ratio (RR), Peto odds ratio and mean difference, as appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twelve trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review. As far as can be determined from the trial reports, the methodological quality of the trials was not high, including a high risk of detection bias in many. Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias.
<RES> Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 years. 83% of participants were white and 40% were male. All studies were a minimum of one year long.
<RES> A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first year after trabeculectomy was detected in eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing surgery for the first time receiving regular-dose 5-FU postoperative injections (RR 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.68 and 0.21, 0.06 to 0.68, respectively). No surgical failures were detected in studies assessing combined surgery. No difference was detected in the low-dose postoperative 5-FU injection group in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24). Peroperative 5-FU in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy significantly reduced risk of failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88). This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4.1 for the high risk of failure patients, and 5.0 for primary trabeculectomy patients receiving postoperative 5-FU.
<RES> Intraocular pressure was also reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU (mean difference (MD) -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43) and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -4.67, 95% CI -6.60 to -2.73). No significant change occurred in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving low-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 1.96). Intraocular pressure was particularly reduced in the high risk of failure population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -16.30, 95% CI -18.63 to -13.97). No difference was detected in the combined surgery population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -1.02, 95% CI -2.40 to 0.37).
<RES> Whilst no evidence was found of an increased risk of serious sight-threatening complications, other complications are more common after 5-FU injections. None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care.
<RES> The quality of evidence varied between subgroups and outcomes, most notably the evidence for combined surgery and low-dose postoperative 5-FU was found to be very low using GRADE. The combined surgery postoperative 5-FU subgroup because no surgical failures have been reported and the sample size is small (n = 118), and the low-dose postoperative 5-FU group because of the small sample size (n = 76) and high risk of bias of the only contributing study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The small but statistically significant reduction in surgical failures and intraocular pressure at one year in the primary trabeculectomy group and high-risk group must be weighed against the increased risk of complications and patient preference.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What are hip protectors?
<ABS> Do they prevent hip fractures?
<ABS> We conducted a review of the effect of hip protectors to prevent hip fractures. We searched for all relevant studies up to December 2012. We found 19 studies with about 17,000 people who were around 80 years old.
<ABS> Overall, there was moderate quality evidence from these studies for the following results.
<ABS> When wearing the hip protectors very few people had side effects, such as skin irritation. However, people often did not wear the hip protectors when they were provided. Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999, and updated several times, most recently in 2010.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review includes 19 studies, nine of which were cluster randomised. These included approximately 17,000 people (mean age range 78 to 86 years). Most studies were overall at low risk of bias for fracture outcomes. Trials tested hard or soft hip protectors enclosed in special underwear in 18 studies.
<RES> Pooling of data from 14 studies (11,808 participants) conducted in nursing or residential care settings found moderate quality evidence for a small reduction in hip fracture risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.00); the absolute effect is 11 fewer people (95% CI, from 20 fewer to 0) per 1000 having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> There is moderate quality evidence when pooling data from five trials in the community (5614 participants) that shows little or no effect in hip fracture risk (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.58); the absolute effect is two more people (95% CI 2 fewer to 6 more) per 1000 people having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> There is probably little to no effect on falls (rate ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.16) or fractures other than of the hip or pelvis (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). However, the risk ratio for pelvic fractures is RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.78 to 2.08); this is an absolute effect of one more person (95% CI 1 fewer to 5 more) per 1000 having a pelvic fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> The incidence of adverse events while wearing hip protectors, including skin irritation, ranged from 0% to 5%. Adherence, particularly in the long term, was poor.

<H1> Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We evaluated the effect of immunisation with influenza vaccines on preventing influenza A or B infections (efficacy), influenza-like illness (ILI) and its consequences (effectiveness), and determined whether exposure to influenza vaccines is associated with serious or severe harms. The target populations were healthy adults, including pregnant women and newborns.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Over 200 viruses cause influenza and ILI, producing the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough and runny noses). Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between them as both last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness. At best, vaccines may only be effective against influenza A and B, which represent about 10% of all circulating viruses. Annually, the World Health Organization estimates which viral strains should be included in the next season's vaccinations.
<ABS> Inactivated vaccine is prepared by treating influenza viruses with a specific chemical agent that “kills” the virus. Final preparations can contain either the complete viruses (whole vaccine) or the active part of them (split or subunit vaccines). These kind of vaccines are normally intramuscularly administered (parenteral route)
<ABS> Live attenuated vaccines is prepared by growing the influenza viruses through a series of cell cultures or animal embryos. With each passage, the viruses lose their ability to replicate in human cells but can still stimulate the immune system. Live attenuated vaccine are administered as aerosol in the nostrils (intranasal route).
<ABS> The virus strains contained in the vaccine are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following epidemic seasons (two type A and one B strains), accordingly to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine).
<ABS> Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible of the pandemic (i.e. the type A H1N1 for the 2009/2010 pandemic).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013. In this update, 90 reports of 116 studies compared the effect of influenza vaccine with placebo or no intervention. Sixty-nine reports were clinical trials (over 70,000 people), 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case-control studies (nearly 25,000 people). Of the 116 studies, 23 (three case-control and 20 cohort studies) were performed during pregnancy (about 1.6 million mother-child couples).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The preventive effect of parenteral inactivated influenza vaccine on healthy adults is small: at least 40 people would need vaccination to avoid one ILI case (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128) and 71 people would need vaccination to prevent one case of influenza (95% CI 64 to 80). Vaccination shows no appreciable effect on working days lost or hospitalisation.
<ABS> The protection against ILI that is given by the administration of inactivated influenza vaccine to pregnant women is uncertain or at least very limited; the effect on their newborns is not statistically significant.
<ABS> The effectiveness of live aerosol vaccines on healthy adults is similar to inactivated vaccines: 46 people (95% CI 29 to 115) would need immunisation to avoid one ILI case.
<ABS> The administration of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is not associated with the onset of multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve of the eye) or immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (a disease that affects blood platelets). The administration of pandemic monovalent H1N1 inactivated vaccine is not associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (a disease that affects the nerves of the limbs and body).
<ABS> Evidence suggests that the administration of both seasonal and 2009 pandemic vaccines during pregnancy has no significant effect on abortion or neonatal death.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The real impact of biases could not be determined for about 70% of the included studies (e.g. insufficient reporting details, very different scores among the items evaluated). About 20% of the included studies (mainly cohorts) had a high risk of bias. Just under 10% had good methodological quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 90 reports containing 116 data sets; among these 69 were clinical trials of over 70,000 people, 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case-control studies (nearly 25,000 people). We retrieved 23 reports of the effectiveness and safety of vaccine administration in pregnant women (about 1.6 million mother-child couples).
<RES> The overall effectiveness of parenteral inactivated vaccine against influenza-like illness (ILI) is limited, corresponding to a number needed to vaccinate (NNV) of 40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128). The overall efficacy of inactivated vaccines in preventing confirmed influenza has a NNV of 71 (95% CI 64 to 80). The difference between these two values depends on the different incidence of ILI and confirmed influenza among the study populations: 15.6% of unvaccinated participants versus 9.9% of vaccinated participants developed ILI symptoms, whilst only 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively, developed laboratory-confirmed influenza.
<RES> No RCTs assessing vaccination in pregnant women were found. The only evidence available comes from observational studies with modest methodological quality. On this basis, vaccination shows very limited effects: NNV 92 (95% CI 63 to 201) against ILI in pregnant women and NNV 27 (95% CI 18 to 185) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in newborns from vaccinated women.
<RES> Live aerosol vaccines have an overall effectiveness corresponding to a NNV 46 (95% CI 29 to 115).
<RES> The performance of one-dose or two-dose whole virion pandemic vaccines was higher, showing a NNV of 16 (95% CI 14 to 20) against ILI and a NNV of 35 (95% CI 33 to 47) against influenza, while a limited impact on hospitalisation was found (NNV 94, 95% CI 70 to 1022).
<RES> Vaccination had a modest effect on time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local harms. No evidence of association with serious adverse events was found, but the harms evidence base was limited.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in the included trials is unclear because it was not possible to assess the real impact of bias.

<H1> Breathing exercises for adults with asthma

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Breathing exercises for asthma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Asthma is a lung disease, that comprises underlying inflammation and tightening of the small tubes in the airways (called airway obstruction), which occurs in response to asthma triggers such as animal danders or pollen (also called bronchial hyperresponsiveness). The high prevalence of asthma worldwide is a major public health problem because of the high healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation and medication. Breathing exercises are a non-pharmacological intervention that has been used routinely in the treatment of patients with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the hyperventilation symptoms of asthma and can be performed as the Papworth Method, the Buteyko breathing technique, yoga or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wanted to look at available evidence for the effectiveness of breathing exercises in adults with asthma.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 13 studies involving 906 adults with mild to moderate asthma. Eleven studies compared breathing exercises with inactive controls and two with asthma education control groups. Overall, improvements in quality of life, asthma symptoms and numbers of exacerbations were reported. Six of the eleven studies that assessed lung function showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises. No adverse effects related to the intervention were described, which indicates that this is a safe and well-tolerated intervention in people with asthma.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The trials were different in terms of type of breathing exercises performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. As a result, we were not able to compare the results from these trials using a meta-analysis for all outcomes. Meta-analysis was possible for only two outcomes (asthma symptoms and change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire—AQLQ), each of which was reported in only two studies. Both meta-analyses showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises. The methods used to conduct these studies were not as well reported as we would have liked, and so the quality of the trials was unclear. Overall the quality of the evidence included in the review was very low.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no conclusive evidence in this review supports or refutes the efficacy of such intervention in the treatment of adult patients with asthma.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in The Cochrane Library 2000, Issue 4.
<ABS> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system. Focal inflammation impairs the ability of white matter tracts to conduct electrical impulses and produces acute episodes of neurological dysfunction called relapses. During a relapse of the disease, the symptoms may cause different levels of impairment with variable recovery. Relapse-related sequelae may accumulate during the course of the disease and cause permanent disability. Disability is commonly evaluated according to the Kurtzke scale, which is scored over a range of 10 points (0 = no disability, 10 = death).
<ABS> Corticosteroids reduce the inflammation in the brain and the spinal cord and are the first drugs of choice to treat exacerbations of MS. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) versus no treatment (placebo) in decreasing disability in MS patients affected by acute relapse. Prevention of long-term morbidity was also evaluated. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of different types of drugs and different schedules of treatment.
<ABS> Six studies published between 1961 and 1998 have been included, with a total of 377 participants.
<ABS> The main results of this review show that corticosteroids (methylprednisolone (MP)) or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation, increasing by more than 60% the probability of ameliorating the episode within the first five weeks of treatment. Clinical recovery was found to be accelerated and reduction of disability was assessed as a 1.5-point change in EDSS score during the first week of therapy. The quality of evidence was moderate. The drugs were well tolerated.
<ABS> No clear data on long-term effects were found.
<ABS> Evidence on the efficacy of different types or schedules of therapies was limited. Indirect comparisons suggest a significantly greater effect of MP versus ACTH. A short-term course (5 days) of MP seems to be more effective than long-term treatment (15 days). The interval between exacerbation onset and the start of treatment does not seem to influence the outcome.
<ABS> Overall, this review provides evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in treating relapses in people with MS. These agents are effective over the short term in improving symptoms, thus favouring recovery.

<H1> Phytoestrogens for menopausal vasomotor symptoms

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Phytoestrogens for vasomotor menopausal symptoms

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: This Cochrane review has evaluated whether phytoestrogen treatments reduce the number and severity of hot flushes and whether they are safe and acceptable.
<ABS> Study characteristics: This review found 43 RCTs conducted up to July 2013 that included 4,084 participants with hot flushes who were close to the menopause or were menopausal. Evidence obtained is current to July 2013.
<ABS> Key results: Some trials reported a slight reduction in hot flushes and night sweats with phytoestrogen-based treatment. Extracts containing high levels of genistein (a substance derived from soy) appeared to reduce the number of daily hot flushes and need to be investigated further. Overall no indication suggested that other types of phytoestrogens work any better than no treatment. No evidence was found of harmful effects on the lining of the womb, stimulation of the vagina or other adverse effects with short-term use.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: Many of the trials in this review were small, of short duration and of poor quality, and the types of phytoestrogens used varied substantially.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Zonisamide in combination with another antiepileptic drug can reduce seizures, but with some adverse effects.
<ABS> Around 70% of epileptic patients can become seizure-free with antiepileptic drug treatment. The remaining 30% of people with epilepsy may be resistant to antiepileptic drugs and still experience seizures. Older drugs do not prevent seizures for everyone and they have adverse effects. New drugs have been developed to try to treat those people who are resistant to the old drugs and to try to limit the adverse effects. These newer drugs are taken as well as the patient's existing medication, as an 'add-on' treatment. Zonisamide is used as an add-on treatment.
<ABS> The trials were assessed with regards to bias and quality and overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as high quality. However more research is need which concentrates on examining the dose of zonisamide.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Topiramate is effective as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<ABS> Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug. Unfortunately some people require more than one antiepileptic medication to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of being generalised.
<ABS> We assessed the trials with regards to bias and quality. Overall, we rated the quality of the evidence as moderate. The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment and future research should consider examining dose.

<H1> Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing otitis media

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccination against pneumococcus (a type of bacterium) on preventing middle ear infections in children.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Key outcomes
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of the evidence for 7-valent PCV in early infancy to be high (further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect), while we judged the quality of the evidence for multivalent (more than seven different serotypes) PCV to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate), as this evidence is derived from only one trial. We judged the quality of the evidence for 7-valent PCV in older children with a history of middle ear infections to be high.
<ABS> Future studies on the effects of PCV in infants, with broader serotype coverage (more than seven different serotypes), are likely to provide more understanding of the role of PCV in preventing middle ear infections.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: This review compared intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes.
<ABS> Background: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an assisted reproduction procedure that places sperm directly into the uterus. Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) is a similar procedure that places sperm into the woman's fallopian tube, closer to the eggs than IUI. Both techniques aim to improve the chance of conception.
<ABS> Study characteristics: The review included 16 randomised controlled trials (more than 1800 women) that compared these procedures for treating couples with non-tubal subfertility. Only three trials reported live birth. The evidence is current to September 2013. No trial reported its funding source, but one reported no conflict of interest, and one stated that it had received no commercial funding.
<ABS> Key results: No clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of couples with non-tubal subfertility. However, a high level of uncertainty due to lack of data is evident in the findings.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most outcomes, largely because of the small quantity of available data.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We included 19 randomised controlled trials in this review but only 16 trials with 2592 women could be included in the analysis. The trials were of a moderate quality, and assessed drugs including unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy and after caesarean birth. We found no evidence to suggest that using heparin in pregnancy or after a caesarean birth reduces the risk of maternal death, DVT or PE, and no differences were shown for these outcomes when different types of heparin were compared. Women who received low molecular weight heparin seemed to be less likely to have bleeding episodes (bruises of more than 1 inch; injection site haematoma (a localised collection of blood outside blood vessels) of at least 2 cm in diameter, bleeding at birth and other bleeding), were less likely to have injection site burning, excess bruising and allergic rashes, and less likely to have a fetal loss, than women who received unfractionated heparin; however, the trials that showed these results were not of high quality.
<ABS> We did not find enough evidence from the trials to be sure about the effects of these preventive treatments. This means there is not enough evidence to show which are the best ways to prevent VTE (including DVT and PE), during or following pregnancy, including after a caesarean birth.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen trials, at an overall moderate risk of bias, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Only 16 trials, involving 2592 women, assessing a range of methods of thromboprophylaxis, contributed data to the review. Six trials compared methods of antenatal prophylaxis: heparin versus no treatment/placebo (two trials), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) (four trials). Nine trials assessed prophylaxis after caesarean section: four compared heparin with placebo; three compared LMWH with UFH; one compared hydroxyethyl starch (HES) with UFH; and one compared five-day versus 10-day LMWH. One study examined prophylaxis with UFH in the postnatal period (including following vaginal births).

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We performed this review to assess the evidence from randomised trials on how effective and safe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is for people with CIDP.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an illness in which nerves become inflamed and this leads to paralysis. The likely cause is that the body attacks its own nerves. CIDP usually requires long-term treatment to prevent further disability. There is much debate about the first choice of treatment. One choice is a medicine called immunoglobulin, which is a product made from purified antibodies from human donor blood and which is given via injection into a vein. Steroid drugs and plasma exchange (a treatment in which the plasma element of a person's blood is replaced), are known to be effective.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Eight randomised controlled trials including 332 participants with CIDP were eligible for this review. These compared IVIg with placebo (dummy treatment), plasma exchange, or steroid drugs.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found five randomised trials which together prove that IVIg improves disability more than placebo (dummy treatment). The results showed that three people would need to be treated for one person to improve. In the three trials that compared IVIg with other treatments, results with IVIg were similar to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone. The evidence was of moderate or high quality. In this review, there were mild and short-term side effects in around half of those who received IVIg. Six per cent of those treated with IVIg had serious side effects, which is a similar rate as with plasma exchange or corticosteroids.
<ABS> Each trial defined improvement in its own way and the trials used different measurement scales, so it is difficult to relate them to changes in the clinical condition of people with CIDP. Only one of the studies that compared IVIg with placebo had a long-term follow-up. It suggested that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 weeks and possibly 48 weeks. Further research is needed to compare the long-term benefits as well as side effects of IVIg with other treatments.
<ABS> The most recent search for studies was in December 2012 and we updated the review with the results of one additional trial.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We considered eight RCTs, including 332 participants, to be eligible for inclusion in the review. These trials were homogeneous and the overall risk of bias low. Five studies, in a total of 235 participants compared IVIg against placebo. One trial with 20 participants compared IVIg with plasma exchange, one trial compared IVIg with prednisolone in 32 participants, and one trial, newly included at this update, compared IVIg with intravenous methylprednisolone in 46 participants.
<RES> A significantly higher proportion of participants improved in disability within one month after IVIg treatment as compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 3.36; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55), high quality evidence). Whether all these improvements are equally clinically relevant cannot be deduced from this analysis because each trial used different disability scales and definitions of significant improvement. In three trials, including 84 participants, the disability score could be transformed to the modified Rankin score, on which improvement of one point after IVIg treatment compared to placebo was barely significant (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.83) (moderate quality evidence). Only one placebo-controlled study included in this review had a long-term follow-up. The results of this study suggest that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks.
<RES> The mean disability score revealed no significant difference between IVIg and plasma exchange at six weeks (moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in improvement in disability on prednisolone compared with IVIg after two or six weeks, or on methylprednisolone compared to IVIg after two weeks or six months (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences in frequencies of side effects between the three types of treatment for which data were available (IVg versus placebo or steroids). (moderate or high quality evidence) Mild and transient adverse events were found in 49% of participants treated with IVIg, while serious adverse events were found in six per cent.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain. Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug (AED); this approach is known as monotherapy. Unfortunately, some people require more than one antiepileptic drug to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of being generalised.
<ABS> Tiagabine is a newer antiepileptic drug that has been used as an additional AED to monotherapy. This review looks at the evidence about how effective tiagabine is in reducing seizures, as well as the side effects that may be associated with its use.
<ABS> A search of databases was carried out on 11 November 2013. Six trials were found that included 900 people with partial epilepsy. These trials were all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the antiepileptic drug topiramate versus a placebo drug or a different AED for a period of up to 24 weeks. By taking all evidence from the trials into account, the review found that tiagabine is effective when used with other drugs to reduce the number of seizures in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. However, adding tiagabine to the usual treatment is associated with an increase in side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, nervousness and tremor.
<ABS> Trials were assessed with regards to bias and quality, and overall, the quality of evidence for the outcome of seizure reduction was rated as high. The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment. Future research is needed to determine how this drug performs in comparison with other newer antiepileptic drugs.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> A secondary objective was to examine the effects of pimozide for people with delusional disorder.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In the one study that compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus the same antipsychotic, significantly fewer relapses were noted in the augmented pimozide group at medium term (1 RCT n = 69, RR 0.28 CI 0.15 to 0.50, low quality evidence). No data were reported for mental state outcomes or for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Data were skewed for quality of life scores, which were not included in the meta-analysis but were presented separately.
<RES> Two studies compared pimozide plus any antipsychotics versus antipsychotic plus placebo; neither study reported data for outcomes of interest, apart from Parkinsonism at medium term and quality of life using the Specific Level of Functioning scale (SLOF); however, data were skewed.
<RES> Only one study compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus antipsychotics plus antipsychotic; no data were reported for global state and mental state outcomes of interest. Data were provided for Parkinsonism (rigidity and tremor) using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS); however, these data were skewed.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies of unclear risk of bias were included for first-line chemotherapy. A total of 88 men under 70 years with good performance status were randomised to receive either supportive care, placebo infusion or ifosfamide. Ifosfamide gave an extra mean survival of 78.5 days compared with supportive care or placebo infusion. Partial tumour response was greater with the active treatment. Toxicity was only seen in the chemotherapy group and quality of life was only assessed at the beginning of treatment. The quality of the evidence for overall survival and adverse effects was very low.
<RES> Three studies of moderate risk of bias were included for second-line chemotherapy at relapse (one identified in the last search). A total of 932 men and women under 75 years and any performance status were randomised to receive either methotrexate-doxorubicin, topotecan, or picoplatin versus symptomatic treatment or BSC. The methotrexate-doxorubicin treatment gave a median survival of 63 days longer than in the symptomatic-treatment group for patients allocated to receive four cycles of first-line chemotherapy, and 21 days longer for patients allocated to receive eight cycles of first-line chemotherapy.
<RES> Treatment with topotecan gave a median survival of 84 days longer than in the BSC group (log-rank P = 0.01). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.87). Treatment with picoplatin gave a median survival time of six days longer than BSC (HR 0.817, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.0895). A meta-analysis of topotecan and picoplatin gave a HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96, P = 0.03; low-quality evidence).
<RES> Partial or complete response in the methotrexate-doxorubicin group was 22.3%. Five patients (7%, 95% CI 2.33 to 15.67) showed a partial response with topotecan. No data were provided about tumour response in the picoplatin study. Toxicity was worst in the chemotherapy group (moderate-quality evidence). Quality of life was better in the topotecan group and was not measured in the methotrexate-doxorubicin and picoplatin studies (low-quality evidence).

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The following hypotheses were tested.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Parental psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the parent-child relationship, with consequences for the later psychological health of the child. Some parenting programmes aim to improve aspects of parental wellbeing and this review specifically looked at whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving any aspects of parental psychosocial health (for example, anxiety, depression, guilt, confidence).
<ABS> We searched electronic databases for randomised controlled trials in which participants had been allocated to an experimental or a control group, and which reported results from at least one scientifically standardised measure of parental psychosocial health.
<ABS> We included a total of 48 studies that involved 4937 participants and covered three types of programme: behavioural, cognitive-behavioural and multimodal. Overall, the results suggested statistically significant improvements in the short-term for parental depression, anxiety, stress, anger, guilt, confidence and satisfaction with the partner relationship. However, only stress and confidence continued to be statistically significant at six month follow-up, and none were significant at one year. There was no evidence of effectiveness for self-esteem at any time point. None of the studies reported aggression or adverse outcomes.
<ABS> Only four studies reported the outcomes for fathers separately. These limited data showed a statistically significant short-term improvement in paternal stress but did not show whether the parenting programmes were helpful in terms of improving depressive symptoms, confidence or partner satisfaction.
<ABS> This review shows evidence of the short-term benefits of parenting programmes on depression, anxiety, stress, anger, guilt, confidence and satisfaction with the partner relationship. The findings suggest that further input may be needed to support parents to maintain these benefits. However, more research is needed that explicitly addresses the benefits for fathers, and that provides evidence of the comparative effectiveness of different types of programme and identifies the mechanisms involved in bringing about change.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The limited data that explicitly focused on outcomes for fathers showed a statistically significant short-term improvement in paternal stress (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06). We were unable to combine data for other outcomes and individual study results were inconclusive in terms of any effect on depressive symptoms, confidence or partner satisfaction.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine and tizanidine) in managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (eg
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> We searched the scientific literature in August 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 25 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 1668 opioid-dependent participants. The studies were undertaken in 11 different countries and involved treatment with an alpha2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine and in one study, tizanidine) compared with reducing doses of methadone (12 studies), placebo (five studies), or symptomatic medications (four studies). Five studies compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. In most studies, treatment was scheduled to last for one to two weeks; the shortest duration was three days and the longest was 30 days.
<ABS> Six studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Opioid withdrawal was similar with alpha2-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone but the duration of treatment was longer and there were fewer adverse effects with methadone. Withdrawal signs and symptoms occurred earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, within a few days of cessation of the opioid drugs. The chances of completing withdrawal treatment were similar.
<ABS> Clonidine and lofexidine were more effective than placebo in managing withdrawal from heroin or methadone, and were associated with higher chances of completing treatment.
<ABS> Lofexidine had less effect on blood pressure than clonidine.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> For alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, the evidence was very low to moderate quality. This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect that were made in this review. However, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that alpha2-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo making further comparisons of this nature inappropriate on ethical grounds.
<ABS> For the comparison of alpha2-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, the quality is rated as low to moderate. The key reasons for the low quality were small numbers of studies reporting some outcomes, low rates of occurrence of some events (eg, drop-out due to adverse effects) and variability between studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<RES> Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57, 3 studies, 148 participants). Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84, 3 studies, 148 participants).
<RES> There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists. Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder whereby blood vessels in the fingers and toes constrict and reduce blood flow, causing pain and discolouration. This is usually in response to cold exposure or emotional stress. In a small number of cases, Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with an underlying disease but, for most people, it is idiopathic (of uncertain cause, or 'primary'). Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is extremely common (especially in women), with one UK study suggesting that over 15% of the population are affected.
<ABS> For people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon who do not respond to conservative measures (e.g. keeping warm), calcium channel blockers represent the first line in drug treatment. Calcium channel blockers (sometimes called calcium antagonists) are drugs that affect the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells and they are the most commonly prescribed medication for primary Raynaud's phenomenon.

<H1> Interventions for the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Limited evidence suggests the best way to improve survival without neurological impairment in children with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is to perform laser treatment to the placenta.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies (253 women and 506 babies) were included. All three trials were judged to be of moderate quality. One study compared amnioreduction with septostomy (71 women), whilst the other two studies compared amnioreduction with endoscopic laser coagulation (182 women). Not all trials provided outcome data that could be included in all meta-analyses.
<RES> Amnioreduction compared with laser coagulation
<RES> Amnioreduction compared with septostomy
<RES> There are no differences in overall death (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, adjusted for clustering, one trial), death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35, one trial), or death of both infants per pregnancy (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.22, one trial) or gestational age at birth (RR 1.20; 95% CI -0.81 to 3.21, one trial) between amnioreduction and septostomy.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Endoscopic laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels should continue to be considered in the treatment of all stages of twin-twin transfusion syndrome to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Individuals with central nervous system disease or injury have a much higher risk of loss of bowel control and severe constipation than other people. This is called neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD). It can be very difficult to treat constipation without causing bowel leakage, or to prevent bowel leakage without causing constipation. The time spent on emptying the bowel is nearly always much greater for these individuals. Bowel problems like this cause a lot of anxiety and distress and can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer them. This review of research about NBD could be of interest to individuals with any damage to the central nervous system caused by disease or injury, or present at birth, which has a long term effect on how their bowel works.
<ABS> While there is a great deal of information on the causes of NBD, there are few studies that focus on how to practically manage the problem. Currently the usual advice is to have a good fluid intake, a balanced diet, as much physical exercise as is practical and a regular planned bowel routine. A bowel routine may include use of oral laxative medicines, suppositories or enemas; abdominal massage; digital rectal stimulation and digital evacuation of stool. The steps used will depend on the needs of each individual and some degree of trial and error is usually needed to achieve a satisfactory routine.
<ABS> Only research studies where participants were allocated to either the control group (who received either no intervention or usual care) or the treatment group by chance (called randomisation) were included in this review as these studies provide the most reliable evidence. Fifteen new studies have been added in this update. Five have been removed because the drugs the studies reported on (cisapride and tegaserod) have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available. Most of the 20 randomised studies in this review included very small numbers of participants and the study reports did not always give the information needed to be sure that the study findings were reliable.
<ABS> Some oral laxatives were found to improve bowel function including psyllium, a stool-bulking laxative (one study), and an isosmotic macrogol (one study), which were both studied in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Some suppositories and micro-enemas used to help the bowel to open produced faster results than others (three studies) and the timing of suppository use may affect the response of the bowel (one study). Digital evacuation of stool may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one study). The use of transanal irrigation in individuals with spinal cord injury improved bowel control, constipation and quality of life measures (one study). Three studies found that abdominal massage was helpful in reducing constipation. One study found that patients may benefit from even one educational contact with a nurse.
<ABS> This review shows that there is still remarkably little research on this common problem which is so important to patients. The research evidence found by the review is generally very poor because the way the studies were carried out and reported means that the results are not reliable. It is not possible to make recommendations for care based on these studies. Managing NBD will continue to rely on trial and error until more high quality studies with larger numbers of participants and which examine the most important aspects of this problem are carried out.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty trials involving 902 people were included.
<RES> Oral medications
<RES> There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) -2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.3 to -1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92).
<RES> Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review.
<RES> Rectal stimulants
<RES> One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol-based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil-based (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository.
<RES> Physical interventions
<RES> There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score).
<RES> One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25).
<RES> There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method.
<RES> Other interventions
<RES> In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one-off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool.
<RES> Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other.

<MaM> Date of last search: 08 July 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The searches identified 14 studies; four studies with 91 participants were included. Two studies were judged to be at low risk of bias based on adequate randomisation but this was unclear in the other two studies. Three of the studies adequately blinded patients, however, the risk of bias was unclear in all studies with regards to allocation concealment and selective reporting.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review of trials found that buprenorphine at high doses (16 mg) can reduce illicit opioid use effectively compared with placebo, and buprenorphine at any dose studied retains people in treatment better than placebo.
<ABS> Buprenorphine appears to be less effective than methadone in retaining people in treatment, if prescribed in a flexible dose regimen or at a fixed and low dose (2 - 6 mg per day). Buprenorphine prescribed at fixed doses (above 7 mg per day) was not different from methadone prescribed at fixed doses (40 mg or more per day) in retaining people in treatment or in suppression of illicit opioid use.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used Cochrane Collaboration methodology.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 31 trials (5430 participants), the quality of evidence varied from high to moderate quality.
<RES> There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine in flexible doses adjusted to participant need,was less effective than methadone in retaining participants, 5 studies, 788 participants, RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95. For those retained in treatment, no difference was observed in suppression of opioid use as measured by urinalysis, 8 studies, 1027 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.02 or self report, 4 studies, 501 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.07, with moderate quality of evidence.
<RES> Consistent with the results in the flexible-dose studies, in low fixed-dose studies, methadone (≤ 40 mg) was more likely to retain participants than low-dose buprenorphine (2 - 6 mg), (3 studies, 253 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87). However, we found contrary results at medium dose and high dose: there was no difference between medium-dose buprenorphine (7 - 15 mg) and medium-dose methadone (40 - 85 mg) in retention, (7 studies, 780 participants, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.10) or in suppression of illicit opioid use as measured by urines, (4 studies, 476 participants, SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.58) or self report of illicit opioid use, (2 studies, 174 participants, SMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.83 to 0.19). Similarly, there was no difference between high-dose buprenorphine (≥ 16 mg) and high-dose methadone (≥ 85 mg) in retention (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.20 to 3.16) or suppression of self-reported heroin use (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.37) (1 study, 134 participants).
<RES> Few studies reported adverse events ; two studies compared adverse events statistically, finding no difference between methadone and buprenorphine, except for a single result indicating more sedation among those using methadone.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Buprenorphine is an effective medication in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence, retaining people in treatment at any dose above 2 mg, and suppressing illicit opioid use (at doses 16 mg or greater) based on placebo-controlled trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About one third of injury deaths are due to shock from blood loss. Preventing shock in people with uncontrolled bleeding is, therefore, very important and is generally done by giving fluids intravenously. The aim is to maintain blood pressure and reduce tissue damage. The composition of these fluids can vary, and there have been systematic reviews comparing different fluid types, but the volume of fluid given and the time at which it is given can also vary. It not yet clear which timing and which volume are the most effective.
<ABS> The authors searched for relevant medical research reports and found six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2128 people. In each study, people with uncontrolled bleeding were randomly assigned to receive one treatment or another. Three studies were about the amount of fluid given (more or less), and three studies were about giving fluid at different times following injury (sooner or later). The authors were interested in finding out which treatments were better, to reduce deaths and to enable blood clotting. Blood clotting was measured by prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time during fluid administration.
<ABS> The review of trials found that there is uncertainty about the best time to give fluid and what volume of fluid should be given. While increasing fluids will maintain blood pressure, it may also worsen bleeding by diluting clotting factors in the blood.
<ABS> The first version of this review was published in 2000 and included these six trials. The authors searched for new, relevant studies in 2003, 2008 and 2014 but none were found. The authors will look for studies in 2020, and any new information will be incorporated into the review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six trials involving a total of 2128 people were included in this review. We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions and patient populations were so diverse.
<RES> Early versus delayed fluid administration
<RES> Three trials reported mortality and two reported coagulation data.
<RES> In the first trial (n = 598) the relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.58). The weighted mean differences (WMD) for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 2.7 (95% CI 0.9 to 4.5) and 4.3 (95% CI 1.74 to 6.9) seconds, respectively.In the second trial (n = 50) the RR for death with early blood transfusion was 5.4 (95% CI 0.3 to 107.1). The WMD for partial thromboplastin time was 7.0 (95% CI 6.0 to 8.0) seconds. In the third trial (n = 1309) the RR for death with early fluid administration was 1.06 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.47).
<RES> Larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration
<RES> Three trials reported mortality and one reported coagulation data.
<RES> In the first trial (n = 36) the RR for death with a larger volume of fluid resuscitation was 0.80 (95% CI 0.28 to 22.29). Prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 14.8 and 47.3 seconds in those who received a larger volume of fluid, as compared to 13.9 and 35.1 seconds in the comparison group.In the second trial (n = 110) the RR for death with a high systolic blood pressure resuscitation target (100 mm Hg) maintained with a larger volume of fluid as compared to a low systolic blood pressure resuscitation target (70 mm Hg) maintained with a smaller volume of fluid was 1.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 3.81). In the third trial (n = 25) there were no deaths.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review has been conducted to assess the effects of using a powered (or 'electric') toothbrush compared with using a manual toothbrush for maintaining oral health.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifty-six trials met the inclusion criteria; 51 trials involving 4624 participants provided data for meta-analysis. Five trials were at low risk of bias, five at high and 46 at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> The number of trials for each type of powered toothbrush varied: side to side (10 trials), counter oscillation (five trials), rotation oscillation (27 trials), circular (two trials), ultrasonic (seven trials), ionic (four trials) and unknown (five trials). The greatest body of evidence was for rotation oscillation brushes which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in plaque and gingivitis at both time points.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Cost, reliability and side effects were inconsistently reported. Any reported side effects were localised and only temporary.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> To find out if there was evidence about non-corticosteroid drugs for children with nephrotic syndrome, and to assess what the benefits and harms of these drugs were, we analysed 32 studies that enrolled 1443 children. The studies compared several drugs and found that cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, levamisole and rituximab reduced the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
<ABS> We found that more studies are needed that compare different drug treatments to determine how these medicines should be used in children with nephrotic syndrome.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Interventions for preoperative smoking cessation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Smoking is a well-known risk factor for complications after surgery. Stopping smoking before surgery is likely to reduce the risk of complications. We reviewed the evidence about the effects of providing smoking cessation interventions to people awaiting surgery on their success in quitting at the time of surgery and longer-term, and at complications following surgery. The evidence is current to January 2014.
<ABS> We searched for randomized studies enrolling people who smoked and were awaiting any type of planned surgery. The trials tested interventions to encourage and help them to stop smoking before surgery. Interventions could include any type of support, including written materials, brief advice, counselling, medications such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, and combinations of different methods. The control could be usual care or a less intensive intervention.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirteen trials enrolling 2010 participants met the inclusion criteria. One trial did not report cessation as an outcome. Seven reported some measure of postoperative morbidity. Most studies were judged to be at low risk of bias but the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to the small number of studies contributing to each comparison.
<RES> Seven trials examined the effect of smoking intervention on postoperative complications. As with smoking outcomes, there was evidence of heterogeneity between intensive and brief behavioural interventions. In subgroup analyses there was a significant effect of intensive intervention on any complications (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.65, 2 trials, 210 participants) and on wound complications (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62, 2 trials, 210 participants). For brief interventions, where the impact on smoking had been smaller, there was no evidence of a reduction in complications (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19, 4 trials, 493 participants) for any complication (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.40, 3 trials, 325 participants) for wound complications. The trial of varenicline did not detect an effect on postoperative complications (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.72, 1 trial, 286 participants).

<H1> Physiotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In spite of various medical and surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients gradually develop significant physical problems. Physiotherapists aim to enable people with PD to maintain their maximum level of mobility, activity and independence through the provision of the appropriate treatment. A range of approaches to movement rehabilitation are used, which aim to enhance quality of life by maximising physical ability and minimising secondary complications over the whole course of the disease. Evidence has shown that physiotherapy has short-term benefits in PD, however which approach of physiotherapy is most effective remains unclear.
<ABS> Only randomised controlled trials were included in this review. These were studies where a group of participants were given one physiotherapy intervention and were compared with another group who received a different physiotherapy intervention. The participants were assigned to a group in a random fashion to reduce the potential for bias.
<ABS> A total of 43 randomised trials involving 1673 participants (average trial size of just 39 participants) were identified as suitable for this review. The trials assessed various physiotherapy interventions, so they were grouped according to the type of intervention being used (general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance or martial arts). However, despite this grouping, the physiotherapy interventions delivered and the outcomes assessed varied so much that the results of the individual trials could not be combined.
<ABS> This review highlights that a wide range of different physiotherapy techniques have been tested to treat PD. Considering the small number of participants, the wide variety of physiotherapy interventions and the outcomes assessed, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of one approach of physiotherapy intervention over another for the treatment of PD.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 43 trials were identified with 1673 participants. All trials used small patient numbers (average trial size of 39 participants); the methods of randomisation and concealment of allocation were poor or not stated in most trials. Blinded assessors were used in just over half of the trials and only 10 stated that they used intention-to-treat analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review shows that a wide range of physiotherapy interventions to treat PD have been tested . There is a need for more specific trials with improved treatment strategies to underpin the most appropriate choice of physiotherapy intervention and the outcomes measured.

<H1> Nitric oxide donors for the treatment of preterm labour

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We identified 12 trials involving 1227 women. We found that there is not enough evidence to show whether or not nitric oxide donors can slow down preterm labour.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twelve trials, including a total of 1227 women at risk of preterm labour, contributed data to this updated review. The methodological quality of trials was mixed; trials comparing nitric oxide donors with other types of tocolytics were not blinded and this may have had an impact on findings.
<RES> When nitric oxide donors were compared with other tocolytic drugs there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors performed better than other tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, a calcium channel blocker or a combination of tocolytics) in terms of pregnancy prolongation, although nitric oxide donors appeared to be associated with a reduction in most adverse effects, apart from headache. There was no significant difference between groups for infant morbidity or mortality outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Physicians and other healthcare professionals often prescribe drugs that will only work at certain concentrations. These drugs are said to have a narrow therapeutic window. This means that if the concentration of the drug is too high or too low, they may cause serious side effects or not provide the benefits they should. For example, blood thinners (anticoagulants) are prescribed to thin the blood to prevent clots. If the concentration is too high, people may experience excessive bleeding and even death. In contrast, if the concentration is too low, a clot could form and cause a stroke. For these types of drugs, it is important that the correct amount of the drug be prescribed.
<ABS> Calculating and prescribing the correct amount can be complicated and time-consuming for healthcare professionals. Sometimes determining the correct dose can take a long time since healthcare professionals may not want to prescribe high doses of the drugs initially because they make mistakes in calculations. Several computer systems have been designed to do these calculations and assist healthcare professionals in prescribing these types of drugs.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We sought clinical trial evidence from scientific databases to evaluate the effectiveness of these computer systems. The evidence is current to January 2012. We found data from 42 trials (40 randomized controlled trials (trials that allocate people at random to receive one of a number of drugs or procedures) and two non-randomized controlled trials).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The quality of the studies was low so these results must be interpreted with caution.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Forty-six comparisons (from 42 trials) were included (as compared with 26 comparisons in the last update) including a wide range of drugs in inpatient and outpatient settings. All were randomized controlled trials except two studies. Interventions usually targeted doctors, although some studies attempted to influence prescriptions by pharmacists and nurses. Drugs evaluated were anticoagulants, insulin, aminoglycoside antibiotics, theophylline, anti-rejection drugs, anaesthetic agents, antidepressants and gonadotropins. Although all studies used reliable outcome measures, their quality was generally low.
<RES> This update found similar results to the previous update and managed to identify specific therapeutic areas where the computerized advice on drug dosage was beneficial compared with routine care:
<RES> 1. it increased target peak serum concentrations (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.13) and the proportion of people with plasma drug concentrations within the therapeutic range after two days (pooled risk ratio (RR) 4.44, 95% CI 1.94 to 10.13) for aminoglycoside antibiotics;
<RES> 2. it led to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants (SMD for percentage of time spent in target international normalized ratio +0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.33) and insulin (SMD for percentage of time in target glucose range: +1.27, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.98);
<RES> 3. it decreased the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.04);
<RES> 4. it decreased the thromboembolism events (rate ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94) and tended to decrease bleeding events for anticoagulants although the difference was not significant (rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.08). It tended to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics (nephrotoxicity: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06) and anti-rejection drugs (cytomegalovirus infections: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40);
<RES> 5. it tended to reduce the length of time spent in the hospital although the difference was not significant (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.02) and to achieve comparable or better cost-effectiveness ratios than usual care;
<RES> 6. there was no evidence of differences in mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypoglycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants.
<RES> For all outcomes, statistical heterogeneity quantified by I2 statistics was moderate to high.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review update suggests that computerized advice for drug dosage has some benefits: it increases the serum concentrations for aminoglycoside antibiotics and improves the proportion of people for which the plasma drug is within the therapeutic range for aminoglycoside antibiotics.
<CON> It leads to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants and insulin. It decreases the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants. It tends to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics and anti-rejection drugs, and it significantly decreases thromboembolism events for anticoagulants. It tends to reduce the length of hospital stay compared with routine care while comparable or better cost-effectiveness ratios were achieved.
<CON> However, there was no evidence that decision support had an effect on mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypoglycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that some decision support technical features (such as its integration into a computer physician order entry system) or aspects of organization of care (such as the setting) could optimize the effect of computerized advice.
<CON> Taking into account the high risk of bias of, and high heterogeneity between, studies, these results must be interpreted with caution.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acoustic stimulation of unborn babies may make tests on their wellbeing more effective.
<ABS> This review of 12 randomised controlled trials involving 6822 mothers found that vibroacoustic stimulation improved the effectiveness of the baby's heart rate testing. However, the data on fetal distress and perinatal death were too few to draw any conclusions on safety. More research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, frequency, duration and position of the vibroacoustic stimulation and to evaluate the safety and perinatal outcomes when used with cardiotocography and other tests of fetal wellbeing.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Self management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Symptoms of patients with COPD slowly worsen over the years. This leads to loss of well-being in these patients. In research, another word for well-being is health-related quality of life. Self management training teaches patients the skills and behaviours they need to successfully manage their disease. Self-management training is becoming more and more important in the treatment of COPD. However, debate on the most effective content is ongoing. Therefore, we reviewed the evidence on the effects of self management on health-related quality of life and on healthcare use in patients with COPD. The evidence is current to August 2011.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> In this review, we assessed 29 studies that evaluated the effects of self management. Patients in these studies were followed for two to 24 months. Twenty-three studies had a control group that received usual care. A total of 3189 patients participated in these studies. In six studies, different components of self management were compared on a head-to-head basis. Content and duration of the self management programmes were diverse.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The studies assessed in this review were diverse. Self management programmes differed in content and duration. Also, types of participants differed across studies. Therefore, no clear recommendations on the most effective content of self management training can be made at this time.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-nine studies were included. Twenty-three studies on 3189 participants compared self management versus usual care; six studies on 499 participants compared different components of self management on a head-to-head basis. Although we included non-randomised controlled clinical trials as well as RCTs in this review, we restricted the primary analysis to RCTs only and reported these trials in the abstract.
<RES> In the 23 studies with a usual care control group, follow-up time ranged from two to 24 months. The content of the interventions was diverse. A statistically relevant effect of self management on HRQoL was found (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, mean difference (MD) -3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.37 to -1.65, 10 studies, 1413 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Self management also led to a lower probability of respiratory-related hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75, nine studies, 1749 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Over one year of follow-up, eight (95% CI 5 to 14) participants with a high baseline risk of respiratory-related hospital admission needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one hospital admission, and 20 (95% CI 15 to 35) participants with a low baseline risk of hospitalisation needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one respiratory-related hospital admission.
<RES> No statistically significant effect of self management on all-cause hospitalisation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.30, 6 studies, 1365 participants, low-quality evidence) or mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.07, 8 studies, 2134 participants, very low-quality evidence) was detected. Also, dyspnoea measured by the (modified) Medical Research Council Scale ((m)MRC) was reduced in individuals who participated in self management (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.30, 3 studies, 119 participants, low-quality evidence). The difference in exercise capacity as measured by the six-minute walking test was not statistically significant (MD 33.69 m, 95% CI -9.12 to 76.50, 6 studies, 570 participants, very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analyses depending on the use of an exercise programme as part of the intervention revealed no statistically significant differences between studies with and without exercise programmes in our primary outcomes of HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions.
<RES> We were unable to pool head-to-head trials because of heterogeneity among interventions and controls; thus results are presented narratively within the review.

<H1> Rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation after surgery for herniation of the lumbar disc

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effects of rehabilitation programmes on pain, recovery, function and return to work in people who have had lumbar disc surgery.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A 'slipped' or 'herniated' disc is thought to be the most common cause of leg pain associated with a 'pinched' or compressed nerve in the lower back. Many patients are treated with a combination of non-surgical measures such as medication or physiotherapy. Patients with persistent symptoms may undergo surgery. Although 78% to 95% of patients will improve after surgery, some will continue to have symptoms. It is estimated that 3% to 12% of patients who have disc surgery will have recurrent symptoms, and most of these patients will have surgery again. 
<ABS> Rehabilitation  programmes, such as exercise therapy by a physiotherapist and advice to return to normal activities like returning to work, are common approaches after surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This updated review evaluated the effectiveness of various rehabilitation programmes for patients who had lumbar disc surgery for the first time. We included 22 randomised controlled trials with 2503 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The evidence is current to May 2013. Most commonly, treatment started four to six weeks after surgery, but the start of treatment ranged from two hours to 12 months after surgery. Considerable variation in the content, duration and intensity of treatments (i.e. exercise programmes) has been noted. The duration of the interventions varied from two weeks to one year; most programmes lasted six to 12 weeks. Participants reported on average serious pain intensity (56 points on a zero to 100 scale, with 100 being the worst possible pain). Most studies compared (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity exercise versus low-intensity exercise or (3) supervised exercise versus home exercise, most commonly starting four to six weeks after surgery. Comparisons in this review included (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity versus low-intensity exercise and (3) supervised versus home exercise.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Patients who participated in exercise programmes four to six weeks after surgery reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those who received no treatment. Patients who participated in high-intensity exercise programmes reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those participating in low-intensity exercise programmes. Patients in supervised exercise programmes reported little or no difference in pain and disability compared with those in home exercise programmes. Here it was difficult to draw firm conclusions in the absence of high-quality evidence.
<ABS> None of the trials reported an increase in reoperation rate after first-time lumbar surgery.
<ABS> The evidence does not show whether all patients should be treated after surgery or only those who still have symptoms four to six weeks later.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Limitations in the methods of half of the trials suggest that the results should be read with caution. Most of the treatments were assessed in only one trial. Therefore for most of the interventions, only low- to very low-quality evidence indicates that no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their effectiveness.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether active rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery is more effective than no treatment, and to describe which type of active rehabilitation is most effective. This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002.
<OBJ> First, we clustered treatments according to the start of treatment.1. Active rehabilitation that starts immediately postsurgery.2. Active rehabilitation that starts four to six weeks postsurgery.3. Active rehabilitation that starts longer than 12 months postsurgery.
<OBJ> For every cluster, the following comparisons were investigated.A. Active rehabilitation versus no treatment, placebo or waiting list control.B. Active rehabilitation versus other kinds of active rehabilitation.C. Specific intervention in addition to active rehabilitation versus active rehabilitation alone.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs).


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. In the majority of patients, hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease and is mostly accompanied by liver cirrhosis. To date, there is no medical cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and treatment aims to slow tumour growth. In high-income countries, about 30% of patients present with the more favourable early hepatocellular carcinoma. For these patients, percutaneous ablation techniques (destruction of the cancer cells by heat, cold, or chemical substances such as ethanol), surgical resection (removal of part of the liver), and liver transplantation (which is limited by organ donor shortage) are currently considered potentially curative treatments. Radiofrequency (thermal) ablation (RFA) is the most elaborated of the percutaneous interventions, so far. Heat caused by alternating electric current is administered by probes that are inserted through the skin (percutaneously).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of RFA for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and to compare its benefits and harms with no treatment, placebo (a pretend treatment), or other treatments (such as hepatic resection, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI), laser or microwave ablation, and liver transplantation). We looked for randomised clinical trials (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups) of people with hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive RFA. Evidence is current to September 2013.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> We found no trials comparing RFA versus no intervention, placebo, chemotherapy, or liver transplantation.

<H1> Dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious complication of severe liver disease. The disease is often fluctuating with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from minor, not readily discernible signs to deep coma. Symptoms often develop in connection to stress related to infection, dehydration, obstipation, or gastrointestinal bleeding. The exact underlying mechanisms behind the disease development are not known. Experimental studies suggest that the mental changes seen in hepatic encephalopathy reflect changes in neurotransmitters in the brain.
<ABS> Dopamine plays a major role in neurotransmission. Several nervous system diseases including Parkinson's disease are caused by a dysfunction in the dopamine system. Some patients with hepatic encephalopathy have symptoms that are similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (slow cerebration; stiffness of movements; tremor). For patients with Parkinson's disease, the drugs known as dopamine agents (drugs that mimic the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine) clearly alleviate symptoms. These drugs have also been assessed for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Dopamine agents had no beneficial or harmful effect on mortality (42/144 (29%) versus 38/144 (26%); OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.54; five trials). Trial sequential analyses demonstrated that we lacked information to refute or recommend the interventions for all outcomes. Dopamine agonists did not seem to increase the risk of adverse events.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment of hypertension in peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When blood pressure is consistently high it can lead to complications such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke. Both peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition that affects the blood vessels (arteries) carrying the blood to the legs, arms, and stomach area, and high blood pressure (hypertension) are associated with atherosclerosis. This is hardening of the arteries which is caused by deposits of fat, cholesterol and other substances inside the blood vessels. PAD is diagnosed when the blood supply to the legs is restricted causing pain and cramping that limits walking (intermittent claudication). It is measured by the walking distance (on a treadmill) before onset of pain (claudication distance) or ankle brachial index (ABI), the ratio of the blood pressure in the arms to the blood pressure in the legs. If the blood pressure is lower in the legs compared to the arms (ABI of less than 1.0) this indicates blocked arteries in the legs (or PAD). PAD can progress to pain at rest and critical limb ischaemia (sudden lack of blood flow to a limb caused by a blood clot or fatty deposit blockage) that requires revascularisation (restoring the blood flow by opening up the blocked blood vessel) or amputation. Treatment of hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events (heart attack or stroke) and death needs careful consideration in people with PAD. Anti-hypertensive medications may worsen the PAD symptoms by further reducing blood flow and supply of oxygen to the limbs, and may have long-term effects on disease progression. The evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the risks and benefits of various anti-hypertensive drugs on measures of PAD is lacking.
<ABS> The evidence on the use of various anti-hypertensive drugs in people with PAD is poor so that it is not known whether significant benefits or risks accrue. However, lack of data specifically examining outcomes in hypertensive PAD patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence on the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Haloperidol was first developed in the late 1950s. Research subsequently showed its therapeutic effects on the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations), having strange beliefs (delusions), aggressiveness, impulsiveness and states of excitement. This led to the introduction of haloperidol as one of the first antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite the introduction of newer antipsychotic drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’ drugs), haloperidol remains in widespread use and is the benchmark for judging the effectiveness of newer antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of haloperidol for schizophrenia and other similar serious mental illnesses compared with ‘dummy’ or no treatment (placebo). A new search for trials was carried out in May 2012 and the review now includes 25 studies with a total of 4651 people. Review authors rated the quality of evidence reported in the trials for seven main outcomes (global state, death, discharge from hospital, relapse, leaving the study early, adverse effects and satisfaction with treatment). For global state, leaving the study early and adverse effects the reviewers rated the evidence as moderate quality, however, relapse and discharge from hospital were rated to be very low quality evidence. There were no data available for death and satisfaction with treatment.
<ABS> Based on moderate quality evidence, haloperidol was found to be better than placebo in treating schizophrenia. More people given haloperidol improved in the first six weeks of treatment than those given placebo. However, a significant number of people on haloperidol suffered from side effects, including muscle stiffness, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, sleepiness and restlessness.
<ABS> Authors concluded that haloperidol is a potent and effective antipsychotic for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia but has the potential to cause debilitating side effects. People with schizophrenia and psychiatrists may wish to prescribe a newer antipsychotic drug with fewer side effects.
<ABS> Finally, a large proportion of other information and data in the trials were poor and badly reported, meaning that better studies are required. Many people, from both groups left the trials early. This suggests that the design and running of the trials was poor and perhaps not acceptable to people. In light of these findings, it is perhaps surprising that haloperidol is a benchmark antipsychotic in widespread use for treating schizophrenia. It is also surprising that haloperidol is widely used as a comparison for new medication. Haloperidol is an effective antipsychotic drug but has serious and debilitating side effects.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In summary, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting specific illness-related symptoms and behaviours can work. More studies on psychological interventions with more people are urgently needed. There are several ongoing randomised controlled studies aimed at improving adherence to prescribed treatments, but final results are not yet available. We recommend multicentre studies to provide evidence for which interventions are most effective for the key issues faced by people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.

<H1> Urodynamic studies (tests) for the management of urinary incontinence in children and adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Eight trials were found, which included around 1100 people, although information was only available for 1036 women. There was not enough evidence to determine whether the urodynamic tests led to better outcomes. There was some evidence that urodynamic testing increased the number of people given drugs but not the number of people undergoing surgery. This did not result in any difference in the number of people who leaked urine, and it was not known whether they had a better quality of life.
<ABS> More research is needed in which people are randomised to having treatment decisions based on either their symptoms and examination alone or after taking into account the extra information provided by urodynamic tests.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The objective of this review was to determine if treatment according to a urodynamic-based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of people with urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes.
<OBJ> The intention was to test the following hypotheses in predefined subgroups of people with incontinence:(i) urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes;
<OBJ> (ii) urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making;
<OBJ> (iii) one type of urodynamic test is better than another in improving the outcomes of management of incontinence or influencing clinical decisions, or both.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight trials involving around 1100 people were included but data were only available for 1036 women in seven trials, of whom 526 received urodynamics. There was some evidence of risk of bias. The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained.
<RES> There was significant evidence that the tests did change clinical decision making. Women in the urodynamic arms of three trials were more likely to have their management changed (proportion with change in management compared with the control arm 17% versus 3%, risk ratio (RR) 5.07, 95% CI 1.87 to 13.74), although there was statistical heterogeneity. There was evidence from two trials that women treated after urodynamic investigations were more likely to receive drugs (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.31). On the other hand, in five trials women undergoing treatment following urodynamic investigation were not more likely to undergo surgery (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference however in the number of women with urinary incontinence if they received treatment guided by urodynamics (37%) compared with those whose treatment was based on history and clinical findings alone (36%) (for example, RR for the number with incontinence after the first year 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21). It was calculated that the number of women needed to treat was 100 women (95% CI 86 to 114 women) undergoing urodynamics to prevent one extra individual being incontinent at one year.
<RES> One trial reported adverse effects and no significant difference was found (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review QuestionWe wanted to find out whether changing the diet (for example by giving supplements) could prevent the development of pressure ulcers. We also wanted to find out if dietary changes could help heal pressure ulcers that had already occurred.
<ABS> The review of trials found that there is no clear evidence that nutritional interventions reduce the number of people who develop pressure ulcers or help the healing of existing pressure ulcers. More research is needed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 23 RCTs, many were small (between 9 and 4023 participants, median 88) and at high risk of bias.
<RES> Eleven trials compared a combination of nutritional supplements, consisting of a minimum of energy and protein in different dosages, for the prevention of pressure ulcers. A meta-analysis of eight trials (6062 participants) that compared the effects of mixed nutritional supplements with standard hospital diet found no clear evidence of an effect of supplementation on pressure ulcer development (pooled RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; P value 0.05; I2 = 13%, random effects). This outcome is at unclear or high risk of bias.
<RES> Fourteen trials evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements on the healing of existing pressure ulcers: seven trials examined mixed nutritional supplements, three the effects of proteins, two trials examined zinc, and two studies examined ascorbic acid. The included trials were heterogeneous with regard to participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes and meta-analysis was not appropriate. There was no clear evidence of an improvement in pressure ulcer healing from the nutritional supplements evaluated in any of these individual studies.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment for primary postpartum haemorrhage

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The review identified 10 randomised controlled trials involving 4052 women. Seven of these trials looked at a drug called misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin and so works by increasing muscle contractions. Overall, the trials suggest that misoprostol does not work as well as oxytocin infusion, and it has more side effects. However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used.
<ABS> Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman. The number of women included in these studies was too small for any useful conclusions regarding their effectiveness and safety.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.
<RES> Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics. Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41).  
<RES> Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not. Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75). Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering.
<RES> Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes.
<RES> One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes.
<RES> We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The role of tranexamic acid and compression methods requires further evaluation. Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Physical fitness training for stroke patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Studies of fitness training can be difficult to carry out. This means most of the studies were small and of moderate quality. However, some consistent findings did emerge. We found that some types of fitness training, particularly those involving walking, can improve exercise ability, walking and balance after stroke. However, there was not enough information to draw reliable conclusions about the impact of fitness training on quality of life or mood.
<ABS> There was no evidence that any of the different types of fitness training caused injuries or other health problems; exercise appears to be a safe intervention.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Gallstones are a common problem in the general population and commonly cause problems with pain (biliary colic) and gallbladder infections (acute cholecystitis). Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder and become trapped in the tube between the gallbladder and the small bowel (common bile duct). Here, they obstruct the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel and cause pain, jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the eyes, dark urine, and pale stools), and sometimes severe infections of the bile (cholangitis). Between 10% and 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Sixteen randomised clinical trials with a total of 1758 randomised participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this review. Eight trials with 737 participants compared open surgical clearance with ERCP; five trials with 621 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with pre-operative ERCP; and two trials with 166 participants compared laparoscopic clearance with postoperative ERCP. One trial with 234 participants compared LCBDE with intra-operative ERCP. There were no trials of open or LCBDE versus ERCP in people without an intact gallbladder. All trials had a high risk of bias.
<RES> There was no significant difference in the mortality between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 5/371 (1%) versus 10/358 (3%) OR 0.51;95% CI 0.18 to 1.44). Neither was there a significant difference in the morbidity between open surgery versus ERCP clearance (eight trials; 733 participants; 76/371 (20%) versus 67/358 (19%) OR 1.12; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.62). Participants in the open surgery group had significantly fewer retained stones compared with the ERCP group (seven trials; 609 participants; 20/313 (6%) versus 47/296 (16%) OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.62), P = 0.0002.
<RES> There was no significant difference in the mortality between LC + LCBDE versus pre-operative ERCP +LC (five trials; 580 participants; 2/285 (0.7%) versus 3/295 (1%) OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.12 to 4.33). Neither was there was a significant difference in the morbidity between the two groups (five trials; 580 participants; 44/285 (15%) versus 37/295 (13%) OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.80 to 2.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of participants with retained stones (five trials; 580 participants; 24/285 (8%) versus 31/295 (11%) OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.45 to 1.39).
<RES> There was only one trial assessing LC + LCBDE versus LC+intra-operative ERCP including 234 participants. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity, retained stones, procedure failure rates between the two intervention groups.
<RES> Two trials assessed LC + LCBDE versus LC+post-operative ERCP. There was no reported mortality in either of the groups. There was no significant difference in the morbidity between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 13/81 (16%) versus 12/85 (14%) OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.72). There was a significant difference in the retained stones between laparoscopic surgery and postoperative ERCP groups (two trials; 166 participants; 7/81 (9%) versus 21/85 (25%) OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.72; P = 0.008.
<RES> There was no significant difference in the conversion rates of LCBDE to open surgery when compared with pre-operative, intra-operative, and postoperative ERCP groups. Meta-analysis of the outcomes duration of hospital stay, quality of life, and cost of the procedures could not be performed due to lack of data.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People with heart failure experience marked reductions in their exercise capacity, which has detrimental effects on their activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and ultimately their hospital admission rate and mortality.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments in which two or more interventions, possibly including a control intervention or no intervention, are compared by being randomly allocated to participants) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise on heart failure in adults over 18 years of age. The inclusion criteria of this updated review were extended to consider not only HF due to reduced ejection fraction (HFREF or 'systolic HF') (ejection fraction is a measure of how well your heart is pumping), but also HF due to preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF or 'diastolic HF'). The search is current to January 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The general lack of reporting of methods in the included trial reports made it difficult to assess their methodological quality and thereby judge their risk of possible bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There is some evidence that manual fetal manipulation of unborn babies make tests of their wellbeing more effective.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials with a total of 1280 women with 2670 episodes of participation. No trial was at low risk of bias for all domains and only two trials were at low risk of bias for both selection and attrition bias.
<RES> Comparing fetal manual manipulation with vibroacoustic stimulation, there was no significant difference in the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography or the need for contraction-stress test.
<RES> There were no data available on other outcomes such as perinatal mortality, fetal distress, maternal anxiety and gestation at delivery.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question:
<ABS> How many embryos should be transferred in couples undergoing ART?
<ABS> Background:
<ABS> Multiple pregnancy creates serious health risks for the mother (such as premature labour, diabetes and high blood pressure) and for the babies, who are at much higher risk than single babies of problems including premature birth, low birth weight, cerebral palsy and perinatal death. Single embryo transfer is now being seriously considered in order to reduce multiple pregnancies but this needs to be balanced against the risk of lowering the overall live birth rate. Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the number of embryos transferred in women undergoing ART. The search is current to July 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics:
<ABS> We found 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2165 participants. Most were not commercially funded.
<ABS> Key findings:
<ABS> Double versus repeated single embryo transfer
<ABS> Based on low quality evidence, there was no indication that overall live birth rates differed substantially when repeated single embryo transfer (either two cycles of single embryo transfer or one cycle of single embryo transfer followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle) was compared with double embryo transfer. The evidence suggested that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following repeated single embryo transfer would be between 31% and 44%. The risk of multiple birth was very much lower in the single embryo transfer group: for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the estimated risk following a repeated single transfer was between 0% and 2%.
<ABS> Double versus single embryo transfer
<ABS> We found high quality evidence that the chances of live birth were lower after one cycle of fresh single embryo transfer than after one cycle of fresh double embryo transfer. For a woman with a 45% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following a single cycle of single embryo transfer was between 24% and 33%. However, the risk of twins was about seven times higher after double embryo transfer.
<ABS> Conclusion:
<ABS> Repeated single embryo transfer appears the best option for most women undergoing ART. Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen RCTs were included in the review (2165 women). Thirteen compared cleavage-stage transfers (2017 women) and two compared blastocyst transfers (148 women): one study compared both. No studies compared repeated single versus repeated multiple embryo transfer (SET).
<RES> Repeated SET versus DET
<RES> Single-cycle SET versus single-cycle DET
<RES> Other comparisons
<RES> Other comparisons were evaluated in four studies which compared DET versus transfer of three or four embryos. Live birth rates did not differ significantly between the groups for any comparison, but there was a significantly lower multiple pregnancy rate in the DET group than in the three embryo transfer (TET) group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.99, two studies, n = 343, I2 = 0%).

<H1> Workplace interventions for smoking cessation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The workplace appears to be a useful setting for helping people to stop smoking. Large groups of smokers are available who can easily be reached and helped, using proven methods. It is also in the employers’ interests to improve the health of their workforce. Recent changes introducing anti-smoking laws in many developed countries may have eased the pressure to demonstrate the value of work-based programmes. The situation in developing countries still requires that such methods be tested and proved in those communities. We reviewed the evidence about workplace programmes to help employees stop smoking, and any information about their costs and benefits.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> For this updated review (first published in 2003), we searched for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, comparing the success rates of those in a work-based stop-smoking programme with those not involved in a work-based stop-smoking programme. The comparison could be between people within a single worksite, or between one or more worksites randomized to a stop-smoking programme or to no programme (cluster-randomized). The study had to include adults (over 18), and could be in any language and reported in any format, published or not. It had to report the numbers stopping smoking for at least six months.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Earlier studies tended to be less well-conducted and reported than recent ones. Fewer than one in five studies randomized their study population by an acceptable method. Two-thirds of the studies checked the accuracy of those who said they had quit by testing their breath, blood or urine. The results were generally in line with findings from other reviews of those ways of quitting in any setting. The 'Summary of findings' table shows that the trials were generally rated as being of moderate to high quality, further confirming the strength of our findings. Future research might examine what features of the large incentives trial made it more successful than other trials in that group. It would also be helpful to have more trials from developing and low-income countries, where smoking rates remain high and anti-smoking laws are not widely enforced.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> 2. We failed to detect an effect of comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors in reducing the prevalence of smoking, although this finding was not based on meta-analysed data.
<CON> 3. There was limited evidence that participation in programmes can be increased by competitions and incentives organized by the employer, although one trial demonstrated a sustained effect of financial rewards for attending a smoking cessation course and for long-term quitting. Further research is needed to establish which components of this trial contributed to the improvement in success rates.
<CON> 4. Further research would be valuable in low-income and developing countries, where high rates of smoking prevail and smoke-free legislation is not widely accepted or enforced.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> There are many different ways of treating patients with prominent (or sticking out) lower front teeth. Orthodontic treatment for children and adolescents is one method used. This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, sought to establish which is the most effective type of orthodontic treatment when carried out in childhood; whether these treatments reduce the need for treatment as an adult; and at what age these treatments are best carried out to ensure that changes made to the shape of the jaw and the positioning of the teeth last until the end of growth and can be maintained into adulthood.
<ABS> In severe cases, people may need surgery as adults to correct this condition. If a successful approach to treatment in childhood were to be found, with long-lasting effects, this kind of surgery may not be necessary. Additionally, the risk of damage to teeth and joints, together with the negative psychological effects associated with the condition, could be lessened or avoided.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Prominent lower front teeth can be an important problem for some people and are usually due to the way the jaws meet together. This condition may be the source of teasing, problems eating, and occasionally problems with speech. The condition may also give rise to problems with the jaw joints in later life. Orthodontic treatment relies on the use of appliances of various kinds either inside or outside of the mouth that are fixed in some way to the teeth, and sometimes placed on parts of the head, to influence the growth of the jaws and position of teeth.
<ABS> This review looked at the use of four different types of orthodontic treatment for correcting prominent lower front teeth in children.
<ABS> -Facemask: an appliance rests on the forehead and chin, connected to the upper teeth with elastic bands that are placed by the wearer. Through this arrangement a balanced force is applied, which it is hoped will pull the upper teeth and jaw forwards and downward to correct the prominent lower teeth.
<ABS> -Chin cup: an appliance rests on the chin with a strap around the back of the head. Forward growth of the lower jaw is resisted, correcting the prominence of the lower front teeth. Nothing is placed in the mouth.
<ABS> -Mandibular headgear: a strap rests on the back of the head and is connected to the lower teeth. This resists forward growth of the lower teeth and jaw in order to correct the prominent lower front teeth.
<ABS> -Tandem traction bow appliance: attachments are fixed to the top and bottom teeth. In the top attachment there is a hook on each side. A metal bar is placed in the lower attachment, which sits in front of the lower teeth. An elastic band can then be placed on each side to pull the top jaw forward and bottom jaw backwards, to correct the prominent lower teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was found to be up to date as of 7 January 2013.
<ABS> A total of seven suitable studies were identified and included in this review; they included 339 children aged from five to 11 years. There were roughly equal numbers of girls and boys in each study and participants were from different ethnic groups depending on where the study was carried out. Studies included were conducted in Turkey, Egypt, China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> This review found some evidence that the use of a facemask appliance can help to correct prominent lower front teeth on a short-term basis. There was no evidence available to show whether or not these short-term changes will still be maintained until the child is fully grown. There was not enough evidence to support any other types of treatment for prominent lower front teeth.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence for the use of a facemask was moderate to low, whilst the quality of the rest of the evidence was very low.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven RCTs with a total of 339 participants were included in this review. One study was assessed as at low risk of bias, three studies were at high risk of bias, and in the remaining three studies risk of bias was unclear. Four studies reported on the use of a facemask, two on the chin cup, one on the tandem traction bow appliance, and one on mandibular headgear. One study reported on both the chin cup and mandibular headgear appliances.
<RES> One study (n = 73, low quality evidence), comparing a facemask to no treatment, reported a mean difference (MD) in overjet of 4.10 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04 to 5.16; P value < 0.0001) favouring the facemask treatment. Two studies comparing facemasks to untreated control did not report the outcome of overjet. Three studies (n = 155, low quality evidence) reported ANB (an angular measurement relating the positions of the top and bottom jaws) differences immediately after treatment with a facemask when compared to an untreated control. The pooled data showed a statistically significant MD in ANB in favour of the facemask of 3.93 ° (95% CI 3.46 to 4.39; P value < 0.0001). There was significant heterogeneity between these studies (I2 = 82%). This is likely to have been caused by the different populations studied and the different ages at the time of treatment.
<RES> One study (n = 73, low quality evidence) reported outcomes of the use of the facemask compared to an untreated control at three years follow-up. This study showed that improvements in overjet and ANB were still present three years post-treatment. In this study, adverse effects were reported but due to the low prevalence of temporomandibular (TMJ) signs and symptoms no analysis was undertaken.
<RES> Two studies (n = 90, low quality evidence) compared the chin cup with an untreated control. Both studies found a statistically significant improvement in ANB, and one study also found an improvement in the Wits appraisal. Data from these two studies were not suitable for pooling.
<RES> A single study of the tandem traction bow appliance compared to untreated control (n = 30, very low quality evidence) showed a statistically significant difference in both overjet and ANB favouring the intervention group.
<RES> The remaining two studies did not report the primary outcome of this review.

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Intravascular brachytherapy for peripheral vascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Intravascular brachytherapy (radiation treatment) inside arteries after angioplasty, stent insertion, or bypass grafts may prevent narrowing of the arteries or grafts. Narrowed and blocked arteries can be treated by bypassing the blockage using a graft, angioplasty (widening the artery by inserting a balloon), or inserting a stent (thin metal sleeve) to hold the artery open. However, restenosis (return of the narrowing or obstruction) often occurs within a year. Intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) aims to prevent restenosis by the application of radiation to the affected part of the artery after the angioplasty or stent insertion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight trials with a combined total of 1090 participants were included in this review. All included studies used the femoropopliteal artery. We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries. All studies compared PTA with or without stenting plus IVBT versus PTA with or without stenting alone. No trials were found comparing IVBT to technologies such as drug eluting stents or balloons, or cryoplasty. Follow-up ranged from six months to five years. The quality of the included trials was moderate with our concerns relating to the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the procedures and the small sample sizes for some studies. Primary outcomes (patency or restenosis and need for re-intervention) were reported in the majority of the trials, but reporting at various time points and the use of multiple definitions of the outcomes by the included studies meant that not all data were available for pooling. The secondary outcomes were not reported in many of the included studies.
<RES> For brachytherapy, cumulative patency was higher at 24 months (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.10, n = 222, P = 0.002). A statistically significant difference was found for restenosis at six months (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.66, n = 562, P = 0.004), 12 months (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, n = 375, P = 0.0002) and 24 months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78, n = 164, P = 0.007) in favour of IVBT. No difference was found after five years as measured in one study. The need for re-interventions was reported in six studies. Target lesion revascularisation was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with IVBT compared with angioplasty alone (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97, P = 0.04) at six months after the interventions. No statistically significant difference was found between the procedures on the need for re-intervention at 12 and 24 months after the procedures.
<RES> A statistically significant lower number of occlusions was found in the control group at more than three months (OR 11.46, 95% CI 1.44 to 90.96, n = 363, P = 0.02) but no differences were found at less than one month nor at 12 months after the procedures making the clinical significance uncertain. Ankle brachial index was statistically significantly better for IVBT at the 12 month follow-up (mean difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, n = 100, P = 0.02) but no statistically significant differences were found at 24 hours and at six months.
<RES> Quality of life, complications, limb loss, cardiovascular deaths, death from all causes, pain free walking distance and maximum walking distance on a treadmill were similar for the two arms of the trials with no statistically significant difference found between the treatment groups.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Progestogen for preventing miscarriage

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We could not find any evidence from randomized controlled trials that progestogen beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy can generally prevent miscarriage.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen trials (2158 women) are included. The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.24) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby.
<RES> A subgroup analysis of placebo controlled trials did not find a difference in the rate of miscarriage with the use of progestogen (10 trials, 1028 women; Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50).

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Type of incision for below knee amputation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Three randomised controlled studies were identified. Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate. They were reported on between 1977 and 1991 and involved a total of 309 participants. Each reported on different comparisons. Below knee amputation using skew flaps or sagittal flaps provided no advantage over the long posterior flap technique on primary stump healing, which approached 60% for all groups. In the third study, involving 30 participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure with delayed skin closure. Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.
<ABS> Nearly all the surgeons in the study that looked at skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique were new to the skew flap operation and so were on a learning curve. Factors which might have influenced the findings include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and location of pre-existing surgical scars.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Ugly white marks sometimes appear on the teeth during orthodontic (brace) treatment. These are caused by early tooth decay and usually occur with fixed (or glued-on 'train track') braces when the teeth are not cleaned properly.
<ABS> We know that fluoride in toothpaste helps to prevent dental decay; therefore, extra fluoride provided to people wearing braces should protect them from these marks. This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines the evidence for this in existing research. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of fluorides in preventing early tooth decay during orthodontic (brace) treatment and to determine the best way to do this.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Early tooth decay around the brackets that attach braces to the teeth can cause white or brown marks (demineralised white lesions (DWLs)) to appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment. Build-up of dental plaque around these brackets is associated with increased risk of rapid demineralisation of the enamel of teeth. Demineralisation is an early, but reversible, stage in the development of tooth decay. Wearing of fixed braces may be associated with pain, and both the brace and the pain make toothbrushing more difficult, which in turn means that it is harder to prevent the build-up of plaque. People often wear braces for 18 months or longer, and there is a risk that tooth decay will damage the teeth, requiring restorations and fillings to be done.
<ABS> Fluoride is effective in reducing tooth decay in people who are at risk of developing it. Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment. It is important to consider how the fluoride is to be applied and whether children and adolescents (receiving fixed brace treatment) are likely to be willing and able to regularly apply by themselves the amounts needed to prevent early tooth decay.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up-to-date as of 31 January 2013. Three studies with 458 participants were included in this updated review. Participants were undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed braces, and DWLs were assessed on teeth remaining in the mouth at the end of orthodontic treatment.
<ABS> The different ways of applying fluoride that were assessed included:
<ABS> 1. topical fluorides, for example, fluoride-containing varnish, mouthrinse, gel or toothpaste;2. fluoride-releasing devices attached to the braces; and3. control group approaches - individuals did not receive additional fluoride as described, or they received a placebo or a different form of fluoride.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> One study showed that when the dentist paints fluoride-containing varnish around the teeth and brace every time it is adjusted, the risk of developing white marks is reduced by nearly 70%; however, further well-designed trials are required to confirm this finding.
<ABS> The rest of the evidence is weak, and more studies are needed to show the best way of delivering extra fluoride to people wearing braces. Adverse effects or harms of interventions were not reported in any of the included studies.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence found is moderate in the case of one well-designed study and weak in the remaining studies. Recommendations state that further well-conducted research should be conducted in this area.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria. Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study.
<RES> Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review. One study was assessed at low risk of bias for all domains, in one study the risk of bias was unclear and in the remaining study, the risk of bias was high.
<RES> One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value < 0.001). This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants.
<RES> One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index.
<RES> One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured.
<RES> Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Thiazide diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs commonly recommended as first-line treatment for raised blood pressure because they significantly reduce death, stroke and heart attacks. This class includes bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and metolazone. We asked by how much does this class of drugs lower blood pressure and whether there is a difference between individual drugs within the class. We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had assessed this question. The data included in this review was up to date as of February 2014.
<ABS> This review could not provide a valid estimate of short-term harms from all thiazide diuretics because there was incomplete reporting of metabolic effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol and triglycerides) and the number of participants who dropped out of the trials due to adverse drug effects.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.
<RES> In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.
<RES> Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.
<RES> In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).
<RES> In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).
<RES> We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).
<RES> Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.
<RES> Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The results from this updated review indicate that BIS can be useful in guiding the anaesthetic dose to avoid the risk of intraoperative awareness in surgical patients at high risk for awareness. Furthermore, anaesthesia guided by BIS improves anaesthetic delivery and recovery from anaesthesia.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This updated review examined whether light therapy is effective in improving cognition, ADLs, sleep, challenging behaviour, and psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia. Data from 11 trials were included in the analyses.
<ABS> Rest-activity and sleep-wake cycles are controlled by the inborn daily rhythm generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Changes in the SCN appear to be the biological basis for changes in sleep patterns in people with dementia and might be reversed by stimulation of the SCN by light.
<ABS> The light sources in the included studies were a light box placed approximately one metre away from the participants at a height within their visual fields; a light visor worn on their heads; ceiling mounted light fixtures; or dawn-dusk simulation that mimics outdoor twilight transitions.
<ABS> There was no effect of bright light therapy on cognitive function, sleep, agitation, or psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia. The results for a single outcome in a single study, which found a beneficial effect on ADLs, should be regarded with caution and need to be replicated before they could form the basis of a recommendation for the use of bright light therapy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials (13 articles) met the inclusion criteria. However, three of the studies could not be included in the analyses either because the reported data could not be used in the meta-analysis or we were unable to retrieve the required data from the authors.


<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether higher (≥ 3.0 g/kg/d) versus lower (< 3.0 g/kg/d) protein intake during the initial hospital stay of formula-fed preterm infants or low birth weight infants (< 2.5 kilograms) results in improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without evidence of short- and long-term morbidity.
<OBJ> To examine the following distinctions in protein intake.
<OBJ> 1. < 800 grams.
<OBJ> 3. 1200 to 1799 grams.
<OBJ> 4. 1800 to 2499 grams.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One study compared high versus very high protein intake during and after an initial hospital stay. Very high protein intake promoted improved gain in length at term, but differences did not remain significant at 12 weeks corrected age. Three of the 24 infants receiving very high protein intake developed uremia.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Psychotic depression is a severe depression with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations). Uncertainty surrounds the most effective drug treatment for psychotic depression: with an antidepressant alone, with an antipsychotic alone or with the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic.
<ABS> The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression. We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated drug treatments for psychotic depression. We searched for these trials in a wide-ranging way. The search identified 3659 studies, but in the end, we found only 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 929 people.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1. To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo.
<OBJ> 2. To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non-response to prior treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta-analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis.
<RES> We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic.
<RES> However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, P = 0.006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003).
<RES> Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> What are the effects of thyroid hormone treatment (levothyroxine) and minimally invasive procedures on benign thyroid nodules?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Nodules (lumps) within the thyroid gland are common and usually benign. They are more frequent in women, the elderly and in iodine-deficient areas. Thyroid nodules are often observed as an incidental finding in the course of ultrasonography of the thyroid, nodules of more than 1 cm in size are usually detected by palpation of the thyroid gland during a physical examination. Thyroid nodules may occur as a single nodule or as multiple nodules and may contain fluid (cyst). About 5 in 100 palpable thyroid nodules have a risk of becoming malignant (thyroid cancer). Thyroid nodules are often treated with thyroid hormones in order to reduce the size of the nodule. If thyroid nodules cause problems such as pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints, surgery may be performed. Other therapies try to destroy the thyroid nodule by means of minimally invasive procedures (techniques which are less invasive than open surgery) and are usually performed on an outpatient basis.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 31 randomised controlled trials for this systematic review. Altogether 2952 participants were allocated to the various intervention and comparator groups. In total, 16 studies lasting six months to five years investigated the effects of levothyroxine therapy. Eight studies lasting 1 to 12 months investigated the efficacy of injections, mostly of ethanol, into thyroid nodules from which fluid had been slowly removed. Laser therapy (one or up to three sessions) was applied to nodules in five studies lasting 6 to 12 months. Two studies investigated the application of one or two radiofrequency (high-frequency radiowaves) sessions over 6 to 12 months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> None of the interventions investigated death from any cause, the development of thyroid cancer or health-related quality of life. Nodule volume reductions were achieved by all therapies; however, the clinical relevance of this outcome is doubtful. Minimally invasive treatments resulted in improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Some side effects such as light-to-moderate pain were observed after minimally invasive procedures.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most study results were of overall low quality, mainly because only a few people were investigated, findings were imprecise or measurements were prone to bias. Future studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, and should compare minimally invasive therapies with surgery. Studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, death from any cause and long-term side effects of treatments.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of April 2014.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-one studies randomised 2952 outpatients to investigate the effects of different therapies on benign TN. Studies on LT4, PEI, LP and RF ablation therapy randomised 2083, 607, 192 and 70 participants, respectively. We found no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy in benign TN. The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4 and one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions. Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies. Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials.
<RES> No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life. Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, reporting no abnormal cytological findings. One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.
<RES> LT4 compared with no treatment or placebo was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 16% compared with 10% of participants after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.38); P = 0.03; 958 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies. LT4 therapy was generally well tolerated: three studies provided quantitative data on signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which were observed in 25% of LT4-treated versus 7% of placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (269 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> PEI compared with cyst aspiration only was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 83% compared with 44% of participants after 1 to 24 months of follow-up (RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.54); P = 0.0003; 105 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence). Improvements in neck compression symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up were seen in 78% of participants receiving PEI versus 38% of those in comparator groups. No reliable summary effect estimate could be established, RR ranged from 1.0 to 3.06 in favour of PEI (370 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). In all trials, participants experienced periprocedural cervical tenderness and light-to-moderate pain usually lasting from minutes to several hours. As a result of the PEI procedure, 26% of participants reported slight-to-moderate pain compared with 12% of those receiving cyst aspiration only (RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12); P = 0.28; 104 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).
<RES> One study comparing LP with LT4 showed a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of LP after 12 months of follow-up in 33% of LP participants versus 0% of LT4 participants, respectively (62 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence). A total of 82% of LP-treated versus 0% of untreated participants showed improvements in pressure symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up (RR 26.65 (95% CI 5.47 to 129.72); P < 0.0001; 92 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Around 20% of LP-treated participants reported light-to-moderate cervical pain lasting 48 hours or more (97 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> One trial with 40 participants, comparing RF with no treatment, resulted in a mean nodule volume reduction of 76% in the RF group compared with 0% of those in the no-treatment group at six months of follow-up (low-quality evidence). These RF-treated participants had fewer pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints after 12 months of follow-up compared with untreated participants (a 2.8 decrease versus a 1.1 increase on a six-point scale, respectively, with higher values indicating more severe symptoms; low-quality evidence). All participants complained of pain and discomfort during RF, which disappeared when the energy was reduced or turned off (low-quality evidence).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review Questions
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to cause regression and prevent the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer. We found only two small studies.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cervical pre-cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: CIN) can progress to invasive cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). CIN is identified by screening and can be treated with surgery to the cervix, either with destruction of the cells covering the cervix, such as with laser therapy, heating, or freezing, or removal by surgical excision. While this is effective in the majority of cases, the surgery can cause immediate unwanted effects, such as bleeding and infection, or later complications including difficulty with menses due to scarring of the cervix and early (premature) labour.
<ABS> NSAIDs have been found to prevent the development of cancer of the large bowel and other organs, but with some unwanted side effects, especially on the heart and blood vessels. Although rofecoxib, used in one of these studies, was withdrawn from the market in 2004, it may shed light on the feasibility of treatment with other NSAIDs.
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether the use of NSAIDs for women with CIN could promote regression or prevent progression to cervical cancer without undue risk or side effects.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified two randomised studies, including 41 women over the age of 18 years, with moderate or severe CIN. The trials ran from June 2002 until October 2003 and between May 2004 and October 2004. One of them was discontinued before it was completed. The women were given either celecoxib or rofecoxib versus a placebo (sugar tablet) daily by mouth for a period of three to six months.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> There were far too few women involved in the trials to be able to show whether NSAIDs had a helpful effect in causing regression of CIN. No patients progressed to invasive cervical cancer, and no unwanted effects of the NSAID tablets were reported, but the number of women in the studies would have been too small to detect an adverse effect.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> While both studies appear to have been conducted well, there are some questions related to the quality of evidence in relation to concealment and women dropping out of the study before completion of assigned medications. There was insufficient information to assess accuracy of the reporting of information. It is possible that there are other incomplete and unreported studies that have not been identified.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> There is insufficient data at this time to support the use of NSAIDs to cause regression or prevent progression of CIN to cervical cancer.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials of NSAIDs in the treatment of CIN.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In two RCTs, 41 women over the age of 18 years, in an outpatient setting, were randomised to receive celecoxib 200 mg twice daily by mouth for six months versus placebo (one study, 25 participants) or rofecoxib 25 mg once daily by mouth for three months versus placebo (one study, 16 participants). This second study was discontinued early when rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in 2004. The trials ran from June 2002 to October 2003, and May 2004 to October 2004. We have chosen to include the data from the rofecoxib study as outcomes may be similar when other such NSAIDs are utilised.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Trust is a fundamental part of a patient-doctor relationship, and is associated with increased patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care, although blind trust may on occasion facilitate poor care. We wished to know if there are effective ways of enhancing patient trust in doctors, by involving doctors (e.g. training) or patients (e.g. by providing information).
<ABS> We searched a wide variety of databases on 18 March 2013 and identified 10 diverse studies, all randomised controlled clinical trials, with 11,063 participants, that met the review's inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials were new for this update. Overall, they did not provide sufficient evidence that a specific intervention affects trust. All were undertaken in the United States. Two were government funded, while seven were funded by charitable trusts and one by a Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO).
<ABS> Interventions were of three main types; three employed additional physician training, four were education for patients and three provided additional information about doctors in terms of financial incentives or consulting style.
<ABS> Two trialled physician training interventions to improve behaviours known to be associated with trust. The interventions showed no change in the patients' trust in their physician. The third trial showed that training oncologists in communication skills resulted in a small increase in trust.
<ABS> The review was constrained by the lack of consistency between trust measurements, timeframes and populations. We have highlighted the types of further trials that are required to explore the impact of doctors' specific training or the use of a patient-centred or decision-sharing approach on patients' trust. Particularly, there is a need for international studies over longer follow-up periods in different healthcare systems.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 randomised controlled trials (including 7 new trials) involving 11,063 patients. These studies were all undertaken in North America, and all but two involved primary care.  As expected, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies.  Interventions were of three main types; three employed additional physician training, four were education for patients and three provided additional information about doctors in terms of financial incentives or consulting style. Additionally, several different measures of trust were employed.

<H1> Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of current screening programmes in detecting oral cancer at an early stage and whether or not they can assist in decreasing deaths due to oral cancer.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Oral cancer is increasing worldwide and it is the sixth most common cancer overall. The highest rates of oral cancer occur in the most disadvantaged sections of the population. Important risk factors in the development of the disease are tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and sunlight although a role for candida (which causes thrush) and the human papillomavirus (which causes warts) has also been documented. People who are heavy drinkers and also smoke have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared with people who do neither. These factors are considered to be especially important in the development of the disease in young people, a group experiencing an increasing incidence of the disease, particularly in countries with a high incidence of it.
<ABS> Geographic variation in the occurrence of oral cancer around the world is wide. For example it is the most common cancer for men in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and 30% of all new cases of cancer in these countries is oral cancer whereas only 3% of new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom are oral cancer.
<ABS> When people first seek medical help, their oral cancer is usually at a late or advanced stage and the effects of the condition as well as the treatment for it can be extremely debilitating. Death rates from oral cancer and the negative effects of the disease are high and increasing rather than declining as for other cancers such as breast and colon.
<ABS> Prevention screening programmes for other cancers have proven to be effective in early detection. However, whilst there maybe advantages to screening there are disadvantages because screening has the potential to produce either false positive or false negative results. Screening can be targeted at high-risk groups, it can be opportunistic, for example when people attend health services for other reasons, or can be done by looking at statistics across the population as a whole.
<ABS> The aim of preventive screening for early detection of oral cancer is to screen individuals for pre-cancerous conditions which are lesions such as leukoplakia. The most common screening method is visual inspection by a clinician but other techniques include the use of a special blue dye, the use of imaging techniques and measuring biochemical changes to normal calls.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 22 July 2013. The only study included was based in rural areas of the city of Trivandrum in Kerala, India. The study included 191,873 apparently healthy adults aged 35 years or older living in 13 clusters with an average of 14,759 participants in each cluster. Screening took place in seven clusters (96,517 participants) and six clusters acted as a control (95,356 participants). Participants were excluded if they were bedridden, if they had open tuberculosis, other debilitating diseases or were already suffering from oral cancer.
<ABS> Healthcare workers trained in the detection of oral lesions undertook the screening of participants and the social history of participants including use of paan, tobacco, alcohol and dietary supplements was recorded.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review found that overall there is not enough evidence to decide whether screening by visual inspection reduces the death rate for oral cancer and there is no evidence for other screening methods. However, there is some evidence that it might help reduce death rates in patients who use tobacco and alcohol although the only included study may be affected by bias.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of low quality and limited to one study assessed as at high risk of bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was produced to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of long tooth implants passing through the sinus and into cheekbone as an alternative to procedures designed to build up missing bone in the jaw such as bone grafting. The review question was intended to look at three options for this treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Sometimes there is not enough bone in the upper jaw in which to secure dental implants. Sometimes bone is taken from somewhere else in the person's body, or bone substitutes are used. An alternative approach is to place one to three long screw-shaped implants into the sinus and the cheekbone (zygomatic implants). This may mean that bone grafting is unnecessary. The implants can then be used to build and secure artificial teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A search was done on 17 June 2013 and the review team found no trials comparing the outcomes of zygomatic implants with conventional bone grafting.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There are no comparative trials evaluating the effectiveness of long implants passing through the sinus and into the cheekbone as an alternative to bone augmentation procedures.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Not applicable.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The review authors identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of good quality that compared OSR with EVAR, involving a combined total of 2790 participants considered fit for surgery, and one RCT of good quality that compared EVAR with no intervention, involving a total of 404 participants considered unfit for OSR.
<ABS> The pooled analysis of the four trials comparing OSR with EVAR showed that the death rates within 30 days of operation or during admission for surgery were significantly lower in individuals undergoing EVAR than in those undergoing OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%). However, there was no difference in death rates between the groups up to four years after the operation (intermediate follow up) or beyond four years (long-term follow up). Participants undergoing EVAR had a significantly higher incidence of a need for an additional intervention to deal with any complications of the procedure undertaken compared with those receiving OSR. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the two procedures. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of lung complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group. The results of the one RCT comparing EVAR with no intervention in individuals considered unfit for OSR showed no difference in overall death rates and complication rates between the groups.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Studies showed that both EVAR and OSR were associated with similar incidences of cardiac deaths (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P = 0.36) and fatal stroke rate (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55; P = 0.52). The long-term reintervention rate was significantly higher in the EVAR group than in the OSR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02; I2 = 85%). Results of the reintervention analysis should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity. Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the EVAR and OSR groups. However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006).
<RES> In individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR, the one included trial found no difference between the EVAR and no-intervention groups with regard to all-cause mortality at final follow up, with 21.0 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 22.1 deaths per 100 person years in the no-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with EVAR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97). Aneurysm-related deaths were, however, significantly higher in the no-intervention group than in the EVAR group (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02). There was no difference in myocardial events (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91) between the groups in this study.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute pain is often felt soon after injury. Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards. People with pain are used to test pain killers. They have often had wisdom teeth removed. The pain is often treated with pain killers given by mouth. Results can then be applied to other forms of acute pain.
<ABS> A series of reviews has looked at how good pain killers are. This review looked at a drug called celecoxib. Celecoxib is most often used for chronic pain caused by arthritis and is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When used for a long time, celecoxib has fewer side effects associated with the digestive system than other NSAIDs.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies (1785 participants) met the inclusion criteria. The two new studies in this update had been identified in the earlier update, but data were not available. There remain three potentially relevant unpublished studies for which data are not available at this time.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are effective in the management of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden brief pain that occurs despite taking regularly scheduled doses of pain medication. It is a common and debilitating component of pain in patients with cancer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We sought clinical trial evidence to determine the effectiveness of opioids in relieving breakthrough pain and the incidence of side effects in cancer patients. The evidence is current to 6 February 2013.
<ABS> We identified 15 trials and included 1699 participants. The identified studies examined the use of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate (an opioid medicine that relieves pain administered across the mucous membrane of either the mouth or nose) in breakthrough pain in cancer patients taking regularly scheduled opioids. Most studies measured similar outcomes.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Available data suggest that both oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are safe and effective (compared with both placebo and morphine) in relieving breakthrough pain. The side effect profiles of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate were similar to other opioids. Recommendations are made about future clinical trials.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We could wish for more consistency in study design and more studies comparing the oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate formulations to one another.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The original review included four studies (393 participants), all concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain. Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC versus normal-release morphine and one study compared OTFC versus placebo.
<RES> Fifteen studies (1699 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this update. All studies reported on the utility of seven different transmucosal fentanyl formulations, five of which were administered orally and two nasally. Eight studies compared the transmucosal fentanyl formulations versus placebo, four studies compared them with another opioid, one study was a comparison of different doses of the same formulation and two were randomised titration studies. 


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Through August 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials comparing special counseling with usual counseling. In addition, we looked at reference lists to find trials. We also wrote to researchers to find more studies.
<ABS> Only three studies showed better results with the special counseling or reminders. Four trials had few women in them and six lost many women during the study. The studies had moderate quality data. To prevent pregnancy, women should use birth control as planned and should keep using it. More trials of good quality are needed to learn how to help women use their birth control method.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is: what is the optimal interval for dental check-ups (the time period between one dental check-up and the next)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The effects on oral health and the economic impact of altering the recall interval between different types of dental check-ups are unclear. Primary care dental practitioners in many countries have traditionally recommended dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The limited results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not extending the time to the next dental check-up can reduce tooth decay or costs.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of very low quality due to there only being one study and issues with the way it was conducted.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2007.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one study that analysed 185 participants. The study compared the effects of a clinical examination every 12 months with a clinical examination every 24 months on the outcomes of caries (decayed, missing, filled surfaces (dmfs/DMFS) increment) and economic cost outcomes (total time used per person). As the study was at high risk of bias, had a small sample size and only included low-risk participants, we rated the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes as very low.

<H1> Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We assessed the benefits of betamimetics (drugs that inhibit contractions of the uterus) given to women with preterm labour against any adverse effects in randomised controlled trials. The betamimetics were administered, by any route or any dose, and compared with placebo, no treatment or other betamimetics. Twenty trials, testing the effect of betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour, contributed data.The trials were published over a 44-year period between 1966 and 2010 and were conducted in tertiary care or university hospitals in high-income countries.
<ABS> A total of 1367 women in preterm labour participated in the 12 trials that compared a betamimetic with placebo or no treatment. Betamimetics decreased the number of women giving birth within 48 hours and there was a decrease in the number of births within seven days.
<ABS> The delay in the timing of birth did not translate into any improvements in neonatal outcomes but most women in the trials were 32 weeks' gestation or more. Betamimetics were not shown to reduce perinatal deaths or respiratory distress syndrome.
<ABS> The side effects for the woman were considerable. These led to cessation of treatment and symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, headache, difficulty breathing, nausea and/or vomiting.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence from the included trials to suggest that one betamimetic agent was superior to another.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors assessed risk of bias and extracted the data independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-eight trials were assessed as eligible for inclusion in the review, but eight did not report any outcome data relevant to the review. Results are based on the 20 trials that contributed data.
<RES> Nine trials compared different types of betamimetics. Other betamimetics were compared with ritodrine in five trials (n = 948). Other comparisons were examined in single trials: hexoprenaline compared with salbutamol (n = 140), slow versus moderate release salbutamol (n = 52) and salbutamol compared with terbutaline (n = 200). Trials were small, varied, and of insufficient quality to delineate any consistent patterns of effect.

<ABS> Authors' Conclusions


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Malaria due to Plasmodium vivax parasites is widespread. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people with P. vivax malaria are treated with chloroquine for three days to eliminate the parasites in the blood that cause the symptoms of malaria, followed by 15 mg/day of primaquine for 14 days to treat the liver stage of the infection to prevent the disease recurring. However, many people do not complete the primaquine treatment once they feel better after chloroquine treatment. In addition, primaquine can destroy red blood cells in people with a genetic enzyme deficiency (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase enzyme (G6PD) deficiency), and clinicians avoid giving primaquine in areas where people commonly have this deficiency. Shorter courses of primaquine could potentially increase treatment completion and reduce adverse events.
<ABS> The review authors included 15 trials of 4377 adults and children older than one year with vivax malaria. All were treated with chloroquine for the blood stage infection, and then randomized to the 14-day primaquine course, or to shorter primaquine courses (three, five, or seven days); or to higher doses of primaquine given once a week for eight weeks; or to a placebo or no treatment. In twelve studies, treatments were supervised. The evidence is current to 8 October 2013.
<ABS> This review update confirms that the 14-day primaquine course recommended by the WHO is more effective against relapse of vivax malaria than treatment with shorter courses of primaquine.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 15 trials (two cluster-RCTs) of 4377 adult and child participants. Most trials excluded people with G6PD deficiency. Trials compared various regimens of primaquine with the standard primaquine regimen, or with placebo or no treatment. All trials treated blood stage infection with chloroquine.
<RES> Alternative primaquine regimens compared to 14-day primaquine
<RES> Primaquine regimens compared to no primaquine
<RES> The number of people that relapsed was similar between people given five days of primaquine or given placebo or no primaquine (four trials, 2213 participants, high quality evidence; follow-up six to 15 months); but lower with 14 days of primaquine (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75; ten trials, 1740 participants, high quality evidence; follow-up seven weeks to 15 months).
<RES> No serious adverse events were reported. Treatment-limiting adverse events were rare and non-serious adverse events were mild and transient. Trial authors reported that people tolerated the drugs.
<RES> We did not find trials comparing higher dose primaquine regimens (0.5 mg/kg/day or more) for five days or more with the 14-day regimen.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to compare the effectiveness of two commonly used painkillers, paracetamol and ibuprofen and the combination of both in a single tablet in the relief of pain following surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Worldwide the number of surgical operations to remove wisdom teeth is immense, in England alone approximately 63,000 are removed in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals each year. Many patients need time off work and their quality of life is significantly affected. However, despite these consequences, people are often most concerned about pain following the operation which can be severe. It is suggested that the most intense pain is felt three to five hours after surgery. The pain experienced after oral surgery is widely used as a model to measure the effectiveness of painkillers in general.
<ABS> Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth. In 2010, a new painkiller (marketed as Nuromol) containing paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet was licensed for use in the United Kingdom.
<ABS> All the drugs studied in this review had minimal side effects noted when used correctly for short-term pain relief.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 20 May 2013. Seven studies with a total of 2241 participants all involving a direct comparison of ibuprofen to paracetamol or the combination of both were included in this review. All participants had surgery to remove a lower wisdom tooth or teeth that required bone removal or at least caused moderate to severe pain. Painkillers were taken after surgery and different doses of the drugs were compared.
<ABS> The majority of the studies took place in the USA with one in Puerto Rico. Four of the trials took place in clinical research facilities, two in university dental hospitals and one in a private oral surgery clinic. The age of participants differed slightly between studies but was broadly similar, ranging from 15 to 65 years old. All studies included male and female participants.
<ABS> All the studies included in this review looked only at pain relief and intensity information after a single dose of the painkiller after surgery. It is known that pain does continue after this and the drugs evaluated in this review are normally taken every six to eight hours (maximum of four times per day).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Ibuprofen is more effective than paracetamol at all doses studied in this review. On limited evidence, the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol appeared to be no more effective than the single drugs when measured two hours after surgery. However, again on limited evidence, it was found to be more effective than the drugs taken singly when measured at six hours after surgery. Participants taking the combined drug also had a smaller chance of requiring rescue medication.
<ABS> The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups. However, review authors could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> All of the results (outcomes) comparing ibuprofen to paracetamol are of high quality. This means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimates of the effect.
<ABS> When comparing combined versus single drugs, the body of evidence for the proportion of patients with > 50% maximum pain relief (TOTPAR) over two and six hours, was assessed as of moderate quality due to imprecise estimates based on single studies. This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The body of evidence for the use of rescue medication was assessed as being of high quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies were included, they were all parallel-group studies, two studies were assessed as at low risk of bias and three at high risk of bias; two were considered to have unclear bias in their methodology. A total of 2241 participants were enrolled in these trials.
<RES> Ibuprofen was found to be a superior analgesic to paracetamol at several doses with high quality evidence suggesting that ibuprofen 400 mg is superior to 1000 mg paracetamol based on pain relief (estimated from TOTPAR data) and the use of rescue medication meta-analyses. The risk ratio for at least 50% pain relief (based on TOTPAR) at six hours was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.69; five trials) favouring 400 mg ibuprofen over 1000 mg paracetamol, and the risk ratio for not using rescue medication (also favouring ibuprofen) was 1.50 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.79; four trials).
<RES> The combined drug showed promising results, with a risk ratio for at least 50% of the maximum pain relief over six hours of 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.39) (paracetamol 1000 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg) (one trial; moderate quality evidence), and risk ratio not using rescue medication 1.60 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.88) (two trials; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups. However, we could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Routine scale and polish for periodontal health in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Scaling and polishing of the teeth may reduce deposits (plaque and calculus), as well as bleeding and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Over time a reduction in gingivitis (a milder form of gum disease) will reduce progression to periodontitis (a severe gum disease).
<ABS> This review examines the evidence for the effects of routine scale and polish treatment. It has been carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group to assess the benefits or otherwise of routine scale and polish treatments for healthy adults; to establish whether different time intervals between treatments influence these; to assess if the treatment is more effective if given together with instruction on how best to maintain healthy gums, and to compare the effectiveness of the treatment when given either by a dentist or by a dental therapist or hygienist.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many dentists or hygienists provide regular scaling and polishing for most patients at regular intervals even if they are considered to be at low risk of developing gum disease. There is debate about the clinical effectiveness of scaling and polishing and what is the best time interval between treatments.
<ABS> For the purposes of this review a 'routine scale and polish' is scaling and polishing of both the crown and root surfaces to remove deposits of (mainly) bacteria called plaque, and also hardened plaque known as calculus (tartar). Calculus is so hard it cannot be removed by toothbrushing alone and this along with plaque, other debris and staining on the teeth is removed by the scale and polish treatment. Scaling or removal of hardened deposits is done with specially designed dental instruments or ultrasonic scalers and polishing is done mechanically with special pastes.
<ABS> In this review scaling above and below the gum level is included, however any surgical procedure on the gums, any chemical washing of the space between gum and tooth (pocket) and more intense (root planing) scraping of the root than simple scaling is excluded.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 15 July 2013.
<ABS> Three trials with 836 participants were included in this review, ranging from 61 to 470 in each trial. Participants in two trials were adults aged 18 to 73, in the other trial young air force cadets.
<ABS> One study included patients attending three general dental practices for check-up appointments. Only patients with calculus or bleeding on probing and pockets between teeth and gums less than 3.5 mm were included. One study included young adult male US Air Force cadets and the other patients attending a dental school hygiene clinic. All participants had varying degrees of gingivitis but no evidence of loss of the bone that the teeth are anchored in (alveolar bone) which is caused by periodontitis.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The most pertinent result found was from one study which was based in general practice, the most appropriate setting. This study did not show either a benefit or harm for regular six or 12-month scale and polish treatments when compared to no scale and polish. However, the study on young air force cadets compared scale and polish treatments at different time intervals and did find some differences for gingivitis, plaque and calculus when three-month treatments were compared with annual treatments, favouring the three-month treatments. This study also looked at whether the treatment should include both scale and polish and oral hygiene instruction. There were reductions in gingivitis, plaque and calculus. No studies compared dentists with other oral health professionals.
<ABS> Scaling is an invasive procedure and associated with a number of adverse effects including damaged to tooth surfaces and tooth sensitivity. This information was not captured or reported on by the included studies.
<ABS> None of the studies included in this review reported on patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life or economic outcomes.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Given the considerable resources involved in providing this treatments for adults in many countries it is disappointing that there is so little good quality, reliable research evidence available to inform clinical practice. The quality of the evidence was generally low, with one of the included studies being more appropriate than the others.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A 'routine scale and polish' treatment is defined as scaling or polishing or both of the crown and root surfaces of teeth to remove local irritational factors (plaque, calculus, debris and staining), that does not involve periodontal surgery or any form of adjunctive periodontal therapy such as the use of chemotherapeutic agents or root planing.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies were included in this review with 836 participants included in the analyses. All three studies are assessed as at unclear risk of bias. The numerical results are only presented here for the primary outcome gingivitis. There were no useable data presented in the studies for the outcomes of attachment change and tooth loss. No studies reported any adverse effects.
<RES> - Objective 1: Scale and polish versus no scale and polishOnly one trial provided data for the comparison between scale and polish versus no scale and polish. This study was conducted in general practice and compared both six-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments with no treatment. This study showed no evidence to claim or refute benefit for scale and polish treatments for the outcomes of gingivitis, calculus and plaque. The MD for six-monthly scale and polish, for the percentage of index teeth with bleeding at 24 months was -2% (95% CI -10% to 6%; P value = 0.65), with 40% of the sites in the control group with bleeding. The MD for 12-monthly scale and polish was -1% (95% CI -9% to 7%; P value = 0.82). The body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 2: Scale and polish at different time intervalsTwo studies, both at unclear risk of bias, compared routine scale and polish provided at different time intervals. When comparing six with 12 months there was insufficient evidence to determine a difference for gingivitis at 24 months SMD -0.08 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.10). There were some statistically significant differences in favour of scaling and polishing provided at more frequent intervals, in particular between three and 12 months for the outcome of gingivitis at 24 months, with OHI, MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.05; P value = 0.003) and without OHI MD -0.21 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.12; P value < 0.001) (mean per patient measured on 0-3 scale), based on one study. There was some evidence of a reduction in calculus. This body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 3: Scale and polish with and without OHIOne study provided data for the comparison of scale and polish treatment with and without OHI. There was a reduction in gingivitis for the 12-month scale and polish treatment when assessed at 24 months MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.06) in favour of including OHI. There were also significant reductions in plaque for both three and 12-month scale and polish treatments when OHI was included. The body of evidence was once again assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 4: Scale and polish provided by a dentist compared with a dental care professionalNo studies were found which compared the effects of routine scaling and polishing provided by a dentist or dental care professional (dental therapist or dental hygienist) on periodontal health.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration have conducted a review of two types of knee replacement surgery for people with knee osteoarthritis. In one type, the posterior cruciate ligament is kept and in the other, it is removed. After searching for all relevant studies, they found 17 studies with up to 1810 patients.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved during total knee replacement surgery:
<ABS> - this may not improve their range of motion, pain, function and patient satisfaction compared with removing the ligament.
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, especially rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include infection, pain, and the need to have further surgery.
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what is the posterior cruciate ligament?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip. When the joint loses cartilage, the bone may grow abnormally to try and repair the damage and make things worse. For example, it can make the joint painful and unstable. This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee.
<ABS> In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis may be severe enough to require surgery. In total knee replacement surgery, a surgeon removes the damaged joint surface and replaces it with a metal and plastic implant.
<ABS> The posterior cruciate ligament provides support and stable movement of the knee. In total knee replacement surgery, the posterior cruciate ligament can be kept in place or removed. This choice depends on the condition of the ligament, the type of total knee replacement selected or preference of the surgeon. When the ligament is removed, a special peg is used to provide stability and give your knee forward and backward movement with the tibia stabilised in relation to the femur.
<ABS> What happens to people who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed during total knee replacement surgery
<ABS> Range of motion (range of motion is the distance your knee can move from being bent to being fully extended. A lower range of motion is worse; you can’t bend or stretch your knee fully)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had 2 ° less range of motion compared to those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed had a range of motion of 118 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had a range of motion of 116 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °
<ABS> Knee pain (lower score means worse pain)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their pain to be the same as those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their pain to be 48 on a scale of 0 to 50
<ABS> Health related quality of life and functional measures (higher means worse)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 1 point worse than those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 16 on a scale of 0 to 100
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed rated their quality of life to be 15 on a scale of 0 to 100
<ABS> Patient satisfaction (lower means worse)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their satisfaction the same as those who had it removed. This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their satisfaction to be 8 on a scale of 0 to 10
<ABS> Complications and the need to have further surgery
<ABS> - There were no differences in the number of revision surgeries, complications, or other further surgeries in people who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen randomised controlled trials (with 1810 patients and 2206 knees) were found, described in 18 articles. Ten of these were new studies compared to the previous Cochrane Review. One study from the original Cochrane review was excluded. Most new studies compared a posterior cruciate ligament retaining design with a posterior stabilised design, in which the posterior cruciate ligament is sacrificed (a posterior stabilised design has an insert with a central post which can engage on a femoral cam during flexion).
<RES> The quality of evidence (graded with the GRADE approach) and the risk of bias were highly variable, ranging from moderate to low quality evidence and with unclear or low risk of bias for most domains, respectively.
<RES> The mean functional Knee Society Score was 2.3 points higher (81.2 versus 79.0 points; 95% CI of the difference 0.37 to 4.26; P = 0.02) in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group. Results from the outcome Knee Society functional score were homogeneous. All other outcome measures (extension angle, knee pain, adverse effects, clinical questionnaire scores, Knee Society clinical scores, radiological rollback, radiolucencies, femorotibial angle and tibial slope) showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. In the subgroup analyses that allowed pooling of the results of the different studies, no homogeneous statistically significant differences were identified.


<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The methods of the Neonatal Cochrane Review Group were used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The updated review includes 27 studies enrolling 2209 infants. One study enrolling infants at a mean age of > eight days and one duplicate publication were excluded. One new study using darepoetin was identified.
<RES> Early EPO reduced the risk of the 'use of one or more RBC transfusions' (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.85; typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; I2 = 54% for both; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 6 to 10; 16 studies, 1661 infants).
<RES> The total volume of RBCs transfused per infant was reduced (typical mean difference (MD) 7 mL/kg, 95% CI -12 to - 2; I2 = 63%; 7 studies, 581 infants). The number of RBC transfusions per infant was minimally reduced (typical MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.12; I2 = 64%; 13 studies, 951 infants). The number of donors to whom the infants were exposed was significantly reduced (MD-0.54, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.20; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 254 infants).
<RES> There was a non-significant increase in the risk of stage ≥ 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with early EPO (typical RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.17; I2 = 0%; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06; I2 = 29%; 7 studies, 801 infants). A post hoc analysis including all studies that reported on ROP stage ≥ 3, regardless of the age of the infant when EPO treatment was started, showed a significantly increased typical RR of 1.48 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%) and typical RD of 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; P = 0.03; I2 = 50%; 10 studies, 1303 infants) with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 33 (95% CI 17 to infinity). In an Italian study in which the authors compared the use of early intravenous EPO with subcutaneous EPO the overall incidence of stage ≥ 3 was 15%, similar to the incidence of 17% in the study by Romagnoli and co-workers.
<RES> The rates for mortality and morbidities including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis were not significantly changed by early EPO treatment. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months varied.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of erythropoietin treatment between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The percentage of circulating red blood cells (hematocrit) falls after birth in all infants. This is particularly true in preterm infants due to their poor response to anaemia and to the amount of blood that is drawn for necessary testing. Low plasma levels of erythropoietin (a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production) in preterm infants provide a rationale for the use of erythropoietin to prevent/treat anaemia.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> The evidence is current to July, 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> To date 1591 infants (between eight and 28 days of age) born preterm have been enrolled in 30 studies of late administration of EPO to reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions and to prevent donor exposure.
<ABS> Study funding sources
<ABS> We as reviewers have not received any funding for this review and we have no conflict of interest to declare.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> The risk of receiving red blood transfusion is reduced following initiation of EPO treatment. However, the overall benefit of EPO is reduced as many of these infants had been exposed to donor blood prior to entry into the trials. Treatment with late EPO did not have any important effects on death or common complications of preterm birth, except for trends in an increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity. Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease of the eye affecting babies born preterm. It is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels, which may result in scarring and retinal detachment. Retinopathy of prematurity can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing. Sample sizes were small and long-term outcomes (18 to 24 months corrected age) were not reported.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 30 studies (31 comparisons) randomising 1591 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2013 did not identify any new study for inclusion. For this update we moved one study enrolling 230 infants from the early EPO review to this late EPO review.
<RES> Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was minimal heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes. There was no reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis in spite of a reduction in the use of RBC transfusions. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Damage to the nervous system can lead to a lack of co-ordination (dyssynergia) between the bladder (detrusor) and the muscle at the exit of the bladder that allows people to control their bladder emptying (external urethral sphincter muscle). This urologic condition is called detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) and is most frequently seen in people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. Insufficient relaxation of the sphincter during a voiding contraction prevents effective bladder emptying and can lead to high pressures in the bladder. People with increased bladder pressures are at an increased risk for bladder and kidney infections, which may lead to kidney damage and even failure.
<ABS> Treatment is aimed at lowering these pressures by promoting proper bladder emptying. This can be achieved by inserting a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra (i.e. the tube connected to the bladder through which urine is released from the body) to empty the bladder on a regular basis (intermittent catheterisation), use of drugs, or surgery. The first step in treatment is usually not surgery, but surgical options should be considered if this is not possible or feasible. Different types of surgical treatment exist, but the optimal surgical treatment for this condition in adults is as yet unknown. This question is the subject of this review.
<ABS> We found five trials, which included a total of 199 people (with an average age of 40 years) with a variety of causes of DSD. One trial showed that a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the sphincter (sphincterotomy) is better in lowering bladder pressure than placing a permanent thin tube into the urethra (urethral stent), but only after two years.
<ABS> Botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) is a toxin that targets the nervous system locally and interferes with the communications between nerves and muscles. Four trials used botulinum A toxin injections to weaken or paralyse the sphincter. These four trials independently showed that in some outcomes, BTX-A was more effective than placebo, lidocaine, or a treatment combined with drugs.
<ABS> Compared to placebo, BTX-A was more effective in lowering pre-voiding and maximum bladder pressure after 30 days.
<ABS> Comparing BTX-A to lidocaine injections, bladder emptying improved seven and 30 days after botulinum A toxin injection, however, not after one day. Botulinum A toxin injection without the addition of drugs (baclofen) was possibly more effective in increasing the ability of the bladder to stretch than botulinum A toxin injection combined with drugs. However, the quality of the trial reporting this was poor. The botulinum A toxin injection is effective for two to three months and therefore requires frequent reinjection, while the effects of sphincter incision seem to last for at least two years.
<ABS> Two trials reported blood in the urine after injection as an undesired harmful effects (adverse effects) due to the injection of an agent. Also, muscle weakness was reported, which may relate to the BTX-A dose injected.
<ABS> Overall, results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that BTX-A injection improves some outcomes relating to the dynamics of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine 30 days after injection. However, this review showed that there was not enough evidence to identify the most effective surgical treatment for DSD.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five trials (total of 199 participants, average age of 40 years). The neurological diseases causing DSD were traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), or congenital malformations.
<RES> Adverse effects reported were haematuria due to the cystoscopic injection and muscle weakness, of which the latter may be related to the BTX-A dose used.
<RES> All trials had some methodological shortcomings, so insufficient information was available to permit judgement of risk of bias. At least half of the trials had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias. One trial had a high risk of attrition bias, and another trial had a high risk of reporting bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that intraurethral BTX-A injections improve some urodynamic measures after 30 days in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The necessity of reinjection of BTX-A is a significant drawback; a sphincterotomy might therefore be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long-term.


<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials were included. Quasi-randomised trials were excluded.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-two studies were included in this review. However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis. All the women in the included studies had a caesarean section under general anaesthesia. The studies covered a number of comparisons, but were mostly small and of unclear or poor quality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is an injury in which the top end of the upper arm bone is pushed out of the joint socket in a forward direction. Afterwards, the shoulder is less stable and is prone to re-dislocation or subluxation (partial re-dislocation), especially in active young adults. Initial treatment involves putting the joint back in place. This is called 'closed reduction' when it is done without surgery. Subsequent treatment is often conservative (non-surgical) and generally involves placement of the injured arm in a sling or in another immobilising device followed by specific exercises.
<ABS> After a comprehensive search, completed in September 2013, for randomised controlled trials that compared different methods of conservative management of these injuries we included only four trials, one of which was not truly randomised. These trials involved a total of 470 participants (371 male). All had primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods. Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers. All trials were at some risk of bias (systematic errors that could lead to overestimation or underestimation of treatment effectiveness), with two trials in particular being at high risk of bias in a number of aspects. Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the direction and size of effect.
<ABS> All four trials compared immobilisation of the arm in external rotation (when the arm is orientated outwards with the forearm away from the chest) versus immobilisation in internal rotation (the usual sling position, where the arm rests against the chest) following closed reduction. Investigators followed patients for at least two years. The results showed no difference between the two groups in any of our pre-defined outcomes. These included re-dislocations, scores on validated shoulder function questionnaires, return to pre-injury activity or sport, and any instability. Other pre-defined outcomes (patient satisfaction with the intervention, and health-related quality of life outcome data) were not reported. Adverse events were poorly recorded.
<ABS> In our recommendations for future research, we point out the importance of completing and publishing the eight other trials making the same comparison as the four included trials. We also note that other important questions need to be studied, such as how long the shoulder should be immobilised for the best outcomes. In conclusion, current evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to inform choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial, which involved 470 participants (371 male) with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods. Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers. All trials were at some risk of bias but to a differing extent. One was at high risk in all domains of the risk of bias tool, and one was at unclear or high risk in all domains; the other two trials were deemed to have predominantly low risk across all domains. Overall, reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be "very low" for all outcomes, meaning that we are very uncertain about the estimates of effect.
<RES> The four trials evaluated the same comparison - immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation - and each of our three primary outcomes (re-dislocation, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for shoulder instability and resumption of activities) was reported by one or more of the trials, with two-year or longer follow-up. Pooling was possible for "re-dislocation" (three trials) and for aspects of "resumption of sport/activities at pre-injury level" (two trials).
<RES> There was no evidence to show a difference between the two groups in re-dislocation at two-year or longer follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06 favouring internal rotation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.54; P value 0.77; 252 participants; three trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 247 re-dislocations per 1000, these data equate to 15 more (95% CI 67 fewer to 133 more) re-dislocations per 1000 after immobilisation in external rotation. In a medium-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 436 re-dislocations per 1000, the data equate to 26 more (95% CI 118 fewer to 235 more) re-dislocations after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> Nor was evidence found to show a difference between the two groups in return to pre-injury levels of activity at two-year or longer follow-up (RR 1.25 favouring external rotation, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.2; P value 0.43; 278 participants; two trials). In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 204 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 41 more (95% CI 59 fewer to 245 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation. In a high-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 605 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 161 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 395 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> One trial reported that the difference between the two groups in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index scores, analysed using non-parametric statistics, was "not significant (P = 0.32)". Of our secondary outcomes, pooling was possible for "any instability" (two trials) and for important adverse events (three events, two trials). However, adverse event data were collected only in an ad hoc way, and it is unclear whether identification and reporting of such events was comprehensive. No report addressed participant satisfaction or health-related quality of life outcome measures.
<RES> There was no evidence confirming a difference between the two positions of immobilisation in any of the primary or secondary outcomes; for each outcome, the confidence intervals were wide, covering the possibility of substantial benefit for each intervention.

<H1> Antibiotic use for irreversible pulpitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are oral antibiotics effective and safe for treating pain in irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve inside the tooth/nerve damage)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Irreversible pulpitis occurs where the dental pulp (tissue inside the tooth which contains the nerve) has been damaged beyond repair. It is characterised by intense pain (toothache), sufficient to wake someone up at night and is considered to be one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care. Any tooth may be affected, it is not restricted to particular age groups, and it usually occurs as a direct result of dental decay, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends to occur more frequently in older patients.
<ABS> The 'standard of care' for irreversible pulpitis - immediate removal of the pulp from the affected tooth - is now widely accepted and yet in certain parts of the world antibiotics continue to be prescribed.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 5 September 2013. One study involving 40 people with irreversible pulpitis (nerve damage) was included. There were two groups of 20 people, one group was treated with penicillin 500 mg, the other with placebo (no active ingredient) every six hours over a seven-day period. In addition, all of the participants received painkillers (ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) combined with codeine).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Antibiotics do not appear to significantly reduce toothache caused by irreversible pulpitis. Furthermore, there was no difference in the total number of ibuprofen or Tylenol tablets used over the study period between both groups. The administration of penicillin does not significantly reduce the pain perception, the percussion (tapping on the tooth) perception or the quantity of pain medication required by people with irreversible pulpitis. There was no reporting on adverse events or reactions.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as low. There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to decide if antibiotics help for this condition. This review highlights the need for more and better quality studies on the use of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that is seen as periods of high mood called mania, or hypomania if less severe, and periods of low mood (depression).
<ABS> Medication is the main treatment for mania, with the first aim to decrease agitation, aggression and dangerous behaviour.
<ABS> Antipsychotics and other antimanic medicines are included in guidelines for treating mania. This review considers the antipsychotic, aripiprazole, and assesses how effective it is in the treatment of acute mania. It also examines the side effects of aripiprazole and discusses whether people find aripiprazole to be an acceptable treatment for themselves.
<ABS> Ten studies are included (3340 participants). Most studies compared aripiprazole versus placebo, but some researchers compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies) and versus lithium (one study). Two studies examined the effect of adding aripiprazole to another treatment (valproate or lithium) and compared this combination versus placebo combined with these other treatments. We assessed the overall risk of bias in the ten studies as unclear.
<ABS> The main measure of effect was the mean change on the Young Mania Rating Scale from the start to the end of the trial; this tool is used by clinicians to assess the severity of mania. After three weeks of treatment, aripiprazole was better than placebo at reducing the severity of mania when used on its own or when added to other mood stabilisers. The effect was modest. However, aripiprazole caused more inner restlessness (akathisia), nausea, and constipation than placebo. Aripiprazole was similarly effective in reducing the symptoms of mania when compared with other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium). Aripiprazole caused fewer movement disorders and less raised prolactin (a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) than haloperidol. People taking aripiprazole were more likely to remain on treatment than those taking haloperidol but were no more or less likely than those taking placebo or lithium. The main reason for the difference in dropouts between aripiprazole and haloperidol groups was the adverse effects associated with haloperidol.
<ABS> In summary, aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania when compared with placebo. This finding is based on studies that included mixed populations (i.e. children, adolescents and adults). For the adult population, studies have directly compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol, lithium and placebo, but evidence obtained for treatment of the child and adolescent population is available only from placebo-controlled studies. Given the lack of evidence obtained by comparing aripiprazole versus other drugs, its exact place in therapy is unclear. Further studies focused on particular populations are needed to determine whether this treatment is equally effective in different age groups.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 22 studies (3465 participants); 17 studies (3282 participants) compared statin with placebo or no treatment, and five studies (183 participants) compared two different statin regimens.
<RES> From data generally derived from a single high-quality study, it was found that statins may reduce major cardiovascular events (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.84, CI 0.66 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (4 studies, 2322 participants: RR 0.68, CI 0.45 to 1.01), and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.70, CI 0.48 to 1.01); although effect estimates lack precision and include the possibility of no effect.
<RES> Statins had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality (6 studies, 2760 participants: RR 1.08, CI 0.63 to 1.83); fatal or non-fatal stroke (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 1.18, CI 0.85 to 1.63); creatine kinase elevation (3 studies, 2233 participants: RR 0.86, CI 0.39 to 1.89); liver enzyme elevation (4 studies, 608 participants: RR 0.62, CI 0.33 to 1.19); withdrawal due to adverse events (9 studies, 2810 participants: RR 0.89, CI 0.74 to 1.06); and cancer (1 study, 2094 participants: RR 0.94, CI 0.82 to 1.07).
<RES> Statins significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (12 studies, 3070 participants: MD -42.43 mg/dL, CI -51.22 to -33.65); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3004 participants: MD -43.19 mg/dL, CI -52.59 to -33.78); serum triglycerides (11 studies, 3012 participants: MD -27.28 mg/dL, CI -34.29 to -20.27); and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3005 participants: MD -5.69 mg/dL, CI -10.35 to -1.03).
<RES> Statins had uncertain effects on kidney function: ESKD (6 studies, 2740 participants: RR 1.14, CI 0.94 to 1.37); proteinuria (2 studies, 136 participants: MD -0.04 g/24 h, CI -0.17 to 0.25); acute allograft rejection (4 studies, 582 participants: RR 0.88, CI 0.61 to 1.28); and GFR (1 study, 62 participants: MD -1.00 mL/min, CI -9.96 to 7.96).

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Diacerein for osteoarthritis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Diacerein for osteoarthritis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what is diacerein?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down, causing pain and swelling. OA can affect any joint, but the knees, hips and hands are the joints most often studied in clinical trials. In all, 10% of the world’s population aged 60 or older have pain or disability from OA.
<ABS> Diacerein is a slow-acting drug taken as a pill that may slow the breakdown of cartilage and relieve pain and swelling.
<ABS> The review searched for studies up to March 2013 about primary osteoarthritis affecting men and women (18 years and older) of any disease severity.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with osteoarthitis:
<ABS> - Pain may improve slightly more in people taking diacerein.
<ABS> - Improvement in physical function is about the same for people taking diacerein,- or a placebo (fake pill). This may have happened by chance.
<ABS> - Diacerein may slow the process of joint space narrowing slightly of the hip but may have little or no difference on the knee joint as it is seen on an x-ray.
<ABS> - Diacerein may cause side effects in the lower digestive tract, such as diarrhoea.
<ABS> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these findings and is likely to change the estimates.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who take diacerein
<ABS> Pain after three to 36 months
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their pain to be 9 points lower on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain) after taking the medication for three to 36 months (9% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their pain to be 34 on a scale of 0 to 100 after taking the medication compared to people who took a fake pill and rated their pain to be 43 points on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> Physical function after two to 36 months (lower score means worse function)
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their physical function to be 0.30 points lower on a scale of 0 to 24 after taking the medication for two to 36 months (0% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their physical function to be 9.3 on a scale of 0 to 24 after taking the medication compared to people who took a fake pill and rated their physical function to be 9 points on a scale of 0 to 24.
<ABS> Radiographic progression - how the joint looks on an x-ray (reduction in joint space narrowing of at least 0.5 mm)
<ABS> - Seven more people who took placebo had radiographic progression (absolute difference of 7%).
<ABS> - 42 of every 100 people who took diacerein experienced reduction in joint space narrowing of at least 0.5 mm compared to 49 of every 100 people who took a fake pill.
<ABS> Quality of life
<ABS> - The review authors found no studies about quality of life of people who took diacerein compared with placebo.
<ABS> - There was no difference in quality of life of people who took diacerein compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This may have happened by chance.
<ABS> Side effects
<ABS> - Twenty-six more people who took diacerein experienced diarrhoea as a side effect (absolute difference of 26%).
<ABS> - 36 of every 100 people who took diacerein experienced diarrhoea as a side effect compared to 10 of every 100 who took a fake pill.
<ABS> Diarrhoea was the most common side effect and usually occurred during the first two weeks after the start of diacerein.
<ABS> People who took diacerein were not more likely than people who took a placebo to stop taking the medication because of side effects.
<ABS> In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommended that the marketing authorisation of diacerein should be suspended across Europe because of harms outweighing benefits. However, this guidance is not final as the PRAC recommendation will be re-examined.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified three new trials (141 participants), and this updated review now includes 10 trials, totalling 2,210 participants. The most frequent risk of bias was incomplete outcome data, identified in approximately 80% of the studies. Allocation concealment and random sequence generation were unclear in 90% and 40% of the studies, respectively, because of poor reporting.
<RES> Low-quality evidence from six trials (1,283 participants) indicates that diacerein has a small beneficial effect on overall pain (measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale) at three to 36 months (mean difference (MD) -8.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.62 to -1.68), which is equivalent to a 9% pain reduction in the diacerein group (95% CI -16% to -2%) compared with the placebo group. This benefit may not be clinically significant.
<RES> No statistically significant differences in physical function (4 studies, 1006 participants) were noted between the diacerein and placebo groups (Lequesne impairment index, 0 to 24 points) (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.28).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from two trials (616 participants) on slowing of joint space narrowing (a decrease greater than 0.50 mm) in the knee or hip favoured diacerein over placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99), with an absolute risk difference of -6% (95% CI -15% to 2%) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 14 (95% CI 8 to 203). Analysis of the knee joint alone (1 study, 170 participants) did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.74).
<RES> None of the trials of diacerein versus placebo measured quality of life. According to one trial (161 participants), which compared diacerein versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the quality of life of participants in the two groups (as assessed by the Short Form (SF)-36 health survey questionnaire (0 to 800 sum score)) did not differ significantly (MD -40.70, 95% CI -85.20 to 3.80).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from seven trials showed significantly more adverse events in the diacerein group compared with the placebo group after two to 36 months, mainly diarrhoea (RR 3.52, 95% CI 2.42 to 5.11), with an absolute risk increase of 24% (95% CI 12% to 35%), and a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7).
<RES> No statistically significant differences in participant withdrawal due to adverse events were seen at two to 36 months for diacerein compared with placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.01).
<RES> A search of regulatory websites found a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) that the marketing authorization of diacerein should be suspended across Europe because of harms (particularly the risk of severe diarrhoea and potentially harmful effects on the liver) outweighing benefits. However, this guidance is not final as the PRAC recommendation will be re-examined.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We examined the available evidence regarding occlusion treatment for stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) with respect to vision at the end of treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The goal of treatment of SDA is to improve vision in the affected eye and to provide stereopsis, that is, '3-D' vision and depth perception. Treatment may last for several months in order to assure that the affected eye gains as much vision as possible. Also, participation in sports and future employment may be affected by poor vision in one eye or loss of 3-D vision. A common treatment is to occlude or cover the unaffected eye, often with an adhesive patch, in order to force the amblyopic eye to be used. Because young children find occlusion confusing or uncomfortable, occlusion therapy may be difficult for their parents to implement.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomized controlled trials (trials in which participants are randomly assigned to one treatment group or another) that evaluated the effectiveness of occlusion therapy for SDA. Thus, well-designed research studies of SDA are needed before we have the information we need to make treatment decisions.

<H1> Selenium for preventing cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Selenium for preventing cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence suggesting that selenium can help to prevent cancer. This review updates the first Cochrane review on this topic (Dennert 2011).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review includes 55 studies in which adults observed to have high or low selenium levels were followed over time to determine whether they developed cancer, along with eight trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo. The evidence is current to February 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found limited evidence suggesting that individuals observed to have higher selenium levels have a lower incidence of cancer. However, it is not possible to conclude from these studies that selenium was the reason for the lower cancer risk, because a high selenium level might be associated with other factors that reduce cancer risk, such as a healthier diet or lifestyle. Also, selenium comes in many different chemical forms that have different biological activity, and these studies did not identify which chemical forms were being measured. Selenium levels in body tissues in which people might develop cancer (e.g. the prostate) also were not examined.
<ABS> The randomised controlled trials that assessed whether taking selenium supplements might prevent cancer differed considerably in methodological quality and are not equally reliable. Several studies reported that individuals receiving selenium supplements decreased their liver cancer risk, but these studies reported insufficient details about their randomisation process and participant follow-up to be convincing. Recent trials that were judged to be well conducted and reliable have found no effects of selenium on reducing the overall risk of cancer or on reducing the risk of particular cancers, including prostate cancer. In contrast, some trials suggest that selenium may increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, as well as of type 2 diabetes, raising concern about the safety of selenium supplements.
<ABS> Overall, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer. However, for a full understanding of the role of this metalloid in cancer development, more research is needed on how selenium may act differently in individuals with different genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and on the different biological activities of the various selenium compounds, which are still largely unknown.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In this updated review, we have assessed all randomised studies of laparoscopic and open TME for rectal cancer, to compare and combine their results. We included 14 trials reporting on a total of 3528 patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery. In 14.5% of those having laparoscopic surgery needed conversion to open surgery by a large incision in the abdomen due to difficulties or problems during the procedure.
<ABS> There is currently moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) has similar effects to open TME (OTME) on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The estimated effect was imprecise and further research could impact on our confidence int this result. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay. We found that pain was lower in the LTME group and that resumption of diet was better. We did not find clear evidence of a difference in quality of life between the two groups, but costs were higher for LTME. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to our understanding of the effects of these surgical approaches on long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, alone or in combination with thrombolytic agents, in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We identified four trials with a total of 1365 participants in searches conducted up to June 2013: three trials compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Abciximab with intravenous placebo and one trial compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Tirofiban with intravenous aspirin.
<ABS> Key results: The results showed that GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors cause bleeding in the brain, and that this complication offset any benefits. Therefore, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors should be avoided in people with acute ischaemic stroke.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: Overall, the studies were considered at low risk of bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treatments to prevent or reduce damage to nerves from the anticancer (chemotherapy) drug cisplatin or other platinum-containing drugs.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cisplatin and other related platinum-containing drugs that are used to treat solid tumours are toxic to the peripheral nervous system. Most people who complete a full course of cisplatin chemotherapy develop a sensory neuropathy (damage to nerves that carry sensation). Symptoms can include tingling in the extremities and numbness. The neuropathy may only partially recover or not recover at all when the chemotherapy is stopped. To try to reduce the toxicity of platinum drugs, researchers have looked for therapies to protect the nerves.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We carried out a wide search for studies of treatments to prevent this type of nerve damage. We identified a total of 29 clinical trials, which involved almost 3000 participants who were receiving platinum-containing anticancer drugs (mostly cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) for various types of cancer (mainly colon, ovary, and lung cancers). The nine treatments studied were: amifostine (seven trials), calcium and magnesium (four trials), glutathione (seven trials), Org 2766 (four trials) and vitamin E (three trials). There was one trial each of acetylcysteine, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), oxcarbazepine, and retinoic acid. We chose an objective clinical test of sensation to report as our preferred measure of the effects of treatment. Only seven of the studies used this measure. Nine reported the results of nerve conduction studies which are another objective measure of nerve function. Most of the studies used a subjective assessment of neuropathy, such as the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) neuropathy grading scale.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most of the included studies were fairly well performed, where it was possible to obtain this information.
<ABS> Based on the combined results that generally described secondary and non-quantitative measures such as the NCI-CTC neuropathy grading scale, modest but promising (borderline statistically significant) results favoured the use of amifostine, calcium and magnesium, and glutathione to reduce the neurotoxicity of cisplatin and related chemotherapies. Three studies of vitamin E could only be studied individually but the results of each imply some mild subjective benefits. Nevertheless, given the limitations of the studies, such as small numbers of participants, lack of objective measures of neuropathy, and differing results among similar trials, the data remain insufficient to conclude that any of the neuroprotective agents tested prevent or limit the neurotoxicity of platinum drugs. Most of the treatments were not associated with adverse events. Amifostine infusions were associated with temporary low blood pressure in a significant number of cases, and retinoic acid with low levels of calcium in the blood. About one-fifth of people treated with DDTC stopped taking it because of harmful effects.
<ABS> Amifostine, calcium and magnesium, vitamin E, and glutathione require further well designed trials to clarify if they are effective or not.
<ABS> This is an updated review. The evidence is current to 4 March 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> As of 2013, the review includes 29 studies describing nine possible chemoprotective agents, as well as description of two published meta-analyses. Among these trials, there were sufficient data in some instances to combine the results from different studies, most often using data from secondary non-quantitative measures. Nine of the studies were newly included at this update. Few of the included studies were at a high risk of bias overall, although often there was too little information to make an assessment. At least two review authors performed a formal review of an additional 44 articles but we did not include them in the final review for a variety of reasons.
<RES> Adverse events were infrequent or not reported for most interventions. Amifostine was associated with transient hypotension in 8% to 62% of participants, retinoic acid with hypocalcaemia in 11%, and approximately 20% of participantss withdrew from treatment with DDTC because of toxicity.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non-surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation. They can be grouped as.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013. There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low-level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw. There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years. All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Low-level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy. No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments.
<ABS> There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low-level laser therapy. This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution.
<ABS> No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste. No studies reported on quality of life or harm.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review. The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years. Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment compared to placebo laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury.
<RES> The overall quality of the evidence was very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the studies, indirectness of the evidence and the imprecision of the results.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Self-help for anxiety disorders

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Self-help may be useful for people who are not able or are not willing to use other services for people with anxiety disorders; for people who can access it, face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy is probably clinically superior. Economic analyses were beyond the scope of this review.
<CON> Important heterogeneity was noted across trials. Recent interventions for specific problems that incorporate clinician support may be more effective than transdiagnostic interventions (i.e. interventions for multiple disorders) provided with no guidance, but these issues are confounded in the available trials.
<CON> Although many small trials have been conducted, the generalisability of their findings is limited. Most interventions tested are not available to consumers. Self-help has been recommended as the first step in the treatment of some anxiety disorders, but the short-term and long-term effectiveness of media-delivered interventions has not been established. Large, pragmatic trials are needed to evaluate and to maximise the benefits of self-help interventions.

<H1> Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare disease in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine. A common early sign is swelling in the feet and face. Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include low levels of protein in the blood, and high levels of fats in the blood, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides.
<ABS> Managing nephrotic syndrome includes therapies to reduce fats (lipids) in the blood. Several types of lipid-lowering agents including statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and ezetimibe can be used.
<ABS> We looked for evidence from RCTs to establish if lipid-lowering drugs were beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome. We found five small studies that investigated four different lipid-lowering drugs (simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil) in 203 participants with nephrotic syndrome.
<ABS> There is currently not enough high quality evidence from published studies to determine if lipid-lowering agents are helpful in managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants. Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo. We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute diarrhoea, typically due to bacterial or viral infection, is a common childhood illness and, in low-income countries, remains an important cause of death. Over two million children under five years of age die each year in poorer countries because of acute diarrhoea. In richer countries, it does not usually cause death but it is a common reason for young children needing medical advice or hospital admission.
<ABS> Young children with acute diarrhoea may temporarily be unable to digest lactose, the most common type of sugar in milk. Inability to digest and absorb lactose can make the diarrhoea worse and last longer. We looked for evidence that reducing children's lactose intake, either by feeding lactose-free milk or by diluting lactose-containing milk, shortens the duration of diarrhoea and prevents complications such as dehydration.
<ABS> We looked for research up to 13 May 2013 and included 33 trials in our analyses. Twenty-two trials compared outcomes for children given a lactose-free feed with those for children given a lactose-containing feed and 11 trials compared outcomes for children fed a diluted milk feed with those for children given an undiluted milk feed.
<ABS> We found evidence that feeds that do not contain lactose may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (low quality evidence). Lactose-free feeds probably lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> We did not find any evidence that diluted milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea (low quality evidence) but these feeds may lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (low quality evidence).
<ABS> The majority of trials excluded breast fed infants, and none were conducted in low-income countries where diarrhoea can cause death, so the review is relevant to infants and young children who are receiving formula or are weaned in high- and middle-income countries.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed.
<RES> Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Importance of the review/background on the condition
<ABS> Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Globally, an estimated 170 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. Chronic hepatitis C can cause liver damage in the form of inflammation and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Liver damage can lead to liver failure and other complications, including liver cancer. The goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is to prevent complications of hepatitis C infection; this could possibly be achieved by clearing the virus from the blood of the patient (sustained virological response, that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment). However, we still need to understand whether the sustained virological response outcome induced by antiviral treatment has any association with patient-relevant and clinically relevant outcomes. A combination of weekly injections of peginterferon and oral ribavirin represents the current standard of care.
<ABS> Main findings of the review
<ABS> Adverse effects
<ABS> Peginterferon plus ribavirin compared with interferon plus ribavirin significantly increased the risk of adverse events such as neutropenia (lack of white blood cells in the blood), thrombocytopenia (lack of blood platelets in the blood), arthralgia (joint pain), injection site reaction, and nausea, but adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation remained comparable for both treatments (12.3% versus 18.7%). Data about the influence of treatment on quality of life are insufficient.
<ABS> Limitations of the review
<ABS> This effect on virological response seems robust to analysis controlling for the risk of random errors ('play of chance'), but it may be due to the fact that all trials were considered at high risk of bias. Furthermore, we still need to have proof that sustained virological response induced by antiviral treatment has any association with patient-relevant and clinically relevant outcomes.

<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for treating osteoporosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for osteoporosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We conducted a review of the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for people with primary osteoporosis. We found 108 studies with 10,655 people.
<ABS> Background: what is primary osteoporosis and what are Chinese herbal medicines?
<ABS> Bone is a living, growing part of your body. Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone. When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it. As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium). This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall.
<ABS> Chinese herbal medicines are products made from any part of medicinal plants (leaves, stems, buds, flowers or roots). Sometimes non-plant based components (for example insects, deer horn, snake, various shells and powdered fossil) are included. These can be used in the form of raw plant materials, or water or alcohol extracts of raw plant materials. Herbs can also be taken by mouth as capsules, tablets or liquids, or as injections.
<ABS> Chinese herbal medicines are widely used in China for primary osteoporosis but their benefits and harms have not been appraised in order to inform clinical practice.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies up to January 2013, we found 108 studies with 10,655 people with osteoporosis. Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medicine were compared with conventional medicine (47 trials). The average length of treatment was 5.7 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months).
<ABS> Key results: what happens to people with osteoporosis who take Chinese herbal medicines?
<ABS> New fractures
<ABS> We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture. Seven trials evaluated the incidence of fractures. However, these trials were small and had flaws in their methods.
<ABS> Quality of life
<ABS> People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 5.30 points better on a scale of 0 to 100 after three months compared to people who did not take the herbal medicine.
<ABS> People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 56.05 on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> People who took calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 50.75 on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> Serious side effects or deaths
<ABS> No serious side effects or deaths occurred in the trials.
<ABS> We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects. Possible side effects may include a mild stomach ache or diarrhoea.
<ABS> Bone mineral density (the amount and type of minerals in the bone)
<ABS> We found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines with placebo (fake treatment), with no treatment and with conventional medicine. We also found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication with just conventional medication.
<ABS> Compared to placebo (fake treatment), three studies showed that bone mineral density increased slightly with Chinese herbal medicines.
<ABS> Compared to no treatment or conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density with Chinese herbal medicines while others did not.
<ABS> When Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication was compared with just conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density while others did not.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> In people with osteoporosis:
<ABS> - Chinese herbal medicines may improve bone mineral density and quality of life slightly. Further research is likely to change this estimate of how Chinese herbal medicines affect bone mineral density and quality of life.
<ABS> - We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture.
<ABS> - No trial reported death or serious side effects.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One hundred and eight randomised trials involving 10,655 participants were included. Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine were compared with western medicine (47 trials). The risk of bias across all studies was unclear for most domains primarily due to inadequate reporting of study design. Although we rated the risk of selective reporting for all studies as unclear, only a few studies contributed numerical data to the key outcomes.
<RES> One trial showed that Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol had a better effect on quality of life score (scale 0 to 100, higher is better) than calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol (mean difference (MD) 5.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 6.93).
<RES> No trial reported death or serious adverse events of Chinese herbal medicines, while some trials reported minor adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, etc.

<H1> Probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is: what is the best method for preparing the enamel on the surface of teeth so as to improve the bonding (sticking) of fixed orthodontic braces?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 8 March 2013. This review includes 13 published studies in which a total of 417 children and adults randomly received different tooth preparations before fixed orthodontic braces were bonded to their teeth. Eleven of these studies compared SEPs with conventional etching, and two compared two different SEPs.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Only five of the studies provided usable evidence for this review and the combined results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not there is a difference in bond failure (when the orthodontic fixings come away from the tooth) between SEPs and conventional etching. There was also no usable evidence to suggest whether SEPs or conventional etchants lead to less decay around the etching site, or are associated with fewer costs or better participant satisfaction. There was also no usable evidence to enable conclusions to be drawn about which was the best SEP, acid, concentration or etching time.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of low quality due to issues with the way in which some of the studies were conducted.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 studies randomizing 417 participants with 7184 teeth/brackets. We assessed two studies (15%) as being at low risk of bias, 10 studies (77%) as being at high risk of bias and one study (8%) as being at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> Self etching primers (SEPs) versus conventional etchants
<RES> Eleven studies compared the effects of SEPs with conventional etchants. Only five of these studies (three of split-mouth design and two of parallel design) reported data at the participant level, with the remaining studies reporting at the tooth level, thus ignoring clustering/the paired nature of the data. A meta-analysis of these five studies, with follow-up ranging from 5 to 37 months, provided low-quality evidence that was insufficient to determine whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and convention etchants (risk ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.73; 221 participants). The uncertainty in the CI includes both no effect and appreciable benefit and harm. Subgroup analysis did not show a difference between split-mouth and parallel studies.
<RES> There were no data available to allow assessment of the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. One study reported decalcification, but only at the tooth level.
<RES> SEPs versus SEPs
<RES> Two studies compared two different SEPs. Both studies reported bond failure rate, with one of the studies also reporting decalcification. However, as both studies reported outcomes only at the tooth level, there were no data available to evaluate the superiority of any of the SEPs over the others investigated with regards to any of the outcomes of this review.
<RES> We did not find any eligible studies evaluating different etching materials (e.g. phosphoric acid, polyacrylic acid, maleic acid), concentrations or etching times.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Use of pregabalin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs can reduce the frequency of seizures, but has some adverse effects. The overall evidence for reducing seizures was rated as moderate in quality.
<ABS> All included studies were rated as low or unclear in risk of bias. Overall, the risk of bias was rated as unclear due to a suspicion of publication bias. Publication bias may occur when studies that report non-significant findings are not published. In this review, authors suspected this bias because all the included studies showed significant findings and they were all sponsored by the same drug company. Evidence was further rated as moderate in quality for the primary outcome of seizure reduction.
<ABS> A limitation of this review is that there are no data regarding the longer-term effectiveness of pregabalin and this should be investigated in future studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, addressed the question of how effective tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are compared with conventional amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> There is controversy over the best materials to use when restoring or filling holes caused by tooth decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Amalgam fillings have been successfully used for over 150 years and are cost effective. However, their use has declined over recent years partly because of the way they look and because of the perceived risk of mercury that is used in them. Tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are frequently used in the front teeth and also in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 22 October 2013. We searched scientific databases and found seven studies to include in this review comparing composite resin fillings with amalgam fillings and we included two of these studies in the main analysis. There were 3265 composite fillings and 1935 amalgam fillings but is unclear how many children these were in. The exact age of participants was also unclear in some studies; however, both children and adults with permanent teeth at the back of the mouth that required fillings were included. Study centers were located in the UK, USA, Portugal, Sweden, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The main result including only two studies in 921 children suggests that amalgam fillings had lower failure rates than tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings used to fill holes caused by decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth. Further tooth decay (secondary caries) also occurred less frequently next to or under amalgam fillings compared with composite resin fillings. There was no evidence of a difference in the breaking of the two types of fillings.
<ABS> The other five studies only reported the rate of failure of the fillings and the amount of further tooth decay occurring next to or under the fillings (secondary caries) and the results supported those of the two studies above.
<ABS> The results suggest that tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are almost twice as likely to fail compared with amalgam fillings when used for filling permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. Because there was an obvious difference in the color of the fillings, it was not possible to do the comparisons 'blind' so there was, therefore, a high risk of bias.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There is need to review new evidence comparing the effectiveness of both restorations.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the 2205 retrieved references, we included seven trials (10 articles) in the systematic review. Two trials were parallel group studies involving 1645 composite restorations and 1365 amalgam restorations (921 children) in the analysis. The other five trials were split-mouth studies involving 1620 composite restorations and 570 amalgam restorations in an unclear number of children. Due to major problems with the reporting of the data for the five split-mouth trials, the primary analysis is based on the two parallel group trials. We judged all seven trials to be at high risk of bias and we analyzed 3265 composite restorations and 1935 amalgam restorations.
<RES> The parallel group trials indicated that resin restorations had a significantly higher risk of failure than amalgam restorations (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35, P value < 0.001 (fixed-effect model) (low-quality evidence)) and increased risk of secondary caries (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74, P value < 0.001 (low-quality evidence)) but no evidence of an increased risk of restoration fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64, P value = 0.66 (moderate-quality evidence)). The results from the split-mouth trials were consistent with those of the parallel group trials.
<RES> Adverse effects of dental restorations were reported in two trials. The outcomes considered were neurobehavioral function, renal function, psychosocial function, and physical development. The investigators found no difference in adverse effects between composite and amalgam restorations. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as none of the outcomes were reported in more than one trial.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b for chronic hepatitis C

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Importance of the review or background on the condition
<ABS> The main findings of the review
<ABS> The review identified 17 randomised clinical trials. The trials reported on patient-relevant outcomes only occasionally. All trials had high risk of bias ie, a trial might systematically overestimate benefits or underestimate harms of the treatments). Both treatments were associated with a high risk of experiencing adverse events, which may lead to discontinuation of the treatment. Twelve trials reported on clearing the virus from blood six months after the end of treatment. A summary of the current evidence in this review suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a has higher chances of clearing the virus from the patient's blood than peginterferon alpha-2b (in 50% compared with 43%).
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We were unable to identify any evidence on the benefits of one peginterferon over the other on patient-important outcomes.
<ABS> Any limitations of the review
<ABS> There is lack of data regarding patient-important outcomes on this topic.


<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective of this review was to determine the effect of LMWH prophylaxis on reducing the incidence of CVC-related thrombosis in children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The review authors identified two good quality controlled trials that randomized 287 children aged one day to 16 years to either a heparin-bonded catheter or a standard catheter. The median duration of time that the catheter could be used to give fluids (its patency) was not clearly different with the two types of catheter. This was seven days in the heparin-bonded catheter group and six days in the standard catheter group. There was a no difference between the two groups for risk of catheter-related thrombosis over the time the catheter was in. There was a trend towards a reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion in the first week after catheter placement, reported in one study only.
<ABS> The risks of catheter-related blood stream infections and bacterial colonization of the catheter were significantly reduced using the heparin-bonded catheter, with a longer time to develop infection (delayed in the heparin-bonded catheter group); however, it was reported in one study only and the strength of evidence was low. There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A total of 1831 participants received drain (915 patients) versus 'no drain' (916 patients) in 12 trials included in this review. The decision of whether the patients received drain or not was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin. Only two trials including 199 patients were of low risk of bias (free from errors in study design that can result in wrong conclusions, leading to overestimation of benefits and to underestimation of harms of the drainage or no drainage). Nine of the 12 trials included patients who underwent planned operations. The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information. The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information. There was no significant or clinically important differences in the short-term mortality, serious complications, quality of life, length of hospital stay, operating time, return to normal activity, or return to work in the trials that reported these outcomes. The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than in the 'no drain' group in one trial of high risk of bias involving 68 participants. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.

<H1> Dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hypercalciuria, an inherited metabolic condition, is the presence of excessive calcium in the urine. The cause is often unknown (idiopathic), and may occur in people who are otherwise well. Although people with the condition have normal levels of calcium in their blood, calcium is lost through the urine.
<ABS> Adults with hypercalciuria are prone to developing kidney stones and losing calcium from their bones. In children, hypercalciuria can cause blood in the urine (haematuria), frequency-dysuria syndrome (frequent painful or difficult urination), urinary tract infections, abdominal and back pain.
<ABS> It has been suggested that altering the diets of people with hypercalciuria could help to prevent complications of the condition. We therefore aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of dietary interventions that had been investigated in clinical studies. We included five studies in our review, one of which compared a low calcium diet with a diet that included normal levels of calcium, low protein, low salt over five years. This study found that diets unrestricted for calcium intake significantly decreased numbers of new kidney stones.
<ABS> Other dietary interventions, such as unprocessed wheat bran, did not show any evidence of beneficial effects.
<ABS> We did not find any studies in children, and none investigating specific dietary recommendations for those who had hypercalciuria without symptoms.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five studies (379 adult participants) that investigated a range of interventions. Lack of similarity among interventions investigated meant that data could not be pooled. Overall, study methodology was not adequately reported in any of the included studies. There was a high risk of bias associated with blinding (although it seems unlikely that outcomes measures were unduly influenced by lack of intervention blinding), random sequence generation and allocation methodologies were unclear in most studies, but selective reporting bias was assessed as low.
<RES> One study (120 participants) compared a low calcium diet with a normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet for five years. There was a significant decrease in numbers of new stone recurrences in those treated with the normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). This diet also led to a significant decrease in oxaluria (MD 78.00 µmol/d, 95% CI 26.48 to 129.52) and the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation index (MD 1.20 95% CI 0.21 to 2.19).
<RES> One study (210 participants) compared a low salt, normal calcium diet with a broad diet for three months. The low salt, normal calcium diet decreased urinary calcium (MD -45.00 mg/d, 95% CI -74.83 to -15.17) and oxalate excretion (MD -4.00 mg/d, 95% CI -6.44 to -1.56).
<RES> A small study (17 participants) compared the effect of dietary fibre as part of a low calcium, low oxalate diet over three weeks, and found that although calciuria levels decreased, oxaluria increased.
<RES> Phyllanthus niruri plant substrate intake was investigated in a small subgroup with hypercalciuria (20 participants); there was no significant effect on calciuria levels occurred after three months of treatment.
<RES> A small cross-over study (12 participants) evaluating the changes in urinary supersaturation indices among patients who consumed calcium-fortified orange juice or milk for one month found no benefits for participants.
<RES> None of the studies reported any significant adverse effects associated with the interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No studies were found investigating the effect of dietary recommendations on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria.

<H1> Incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in upper abdominal surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after upper abdominal surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Objective
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of incentive spirometry (IS), compared to no intervention or other therapy, to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications (for example, pneumonia, fever, death) in people following upper abdominal surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included adults (aged 18 years and above) admitted for any type of upper abdominal surgery. The evidence is current to August 2013. We found 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants. The maximum period of time that a patient was followed by the doctor was seven days postoperatively. The quality of the included studies was uncertain because of poor reporting in the published articles.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The following results were examined in this review: clinical complications, respiratory failure (that is, inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system), and pulmonary complications. The results from participants receiving IS were the same as for those receiving either no treatment, deep breathing exercises (DBE) or physiotherapy in the meta-analyses for clinical complications, respiratory failure, and pulmonary complications.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Because of poorly conducted studies (results not similar across studies; some issues with study design and; not enough data collected and organized) we ranked the overall quality of the evidence reported in this review as low.
<ABS> Conclusion and future research
<ABS> There is low quality evidence showing a lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery. This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There are many causes of acute cough, one of which is pneumonia. Cough is burdensome and impairs quality of life. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are commonly purchased and used by patients, and are recommended by healthcare staff as additional medications in the treatment of pneumonia. There are many classes of OTC medications for cough, such as mucolytics (medications that can reduce the thickness of mucus) and antitussives (medications that suppress cough). This review aims to balance the possible benefits of these agents with their potential risks.
<ABS> In this review we found four studies with a total of 224 participants that were suitable for inclusion; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults. However, data could only be obtained from two studies; both studies used mucolytics (ambroxol and bromhexine) in conjunction with antibiotics. Combining these two studies, the rate of cure or improvement in cough of people who received mucolytics was similar to those who did not. However, in the secondary analysis, children who received a mucolytic were more likely to be cured of cough (the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 was 5 for children and 4 for adults). There were no reported increased adverse events in the treatment group.
<ABS> The range of possible adverse events associated with OTC medications for cough is wide and includes minimal adverse events (such as with the use of honey) to serious adverse events, such as altered heart rate patterns, drowsiness and death in young children. The studies included in this review did not report any detectable increase in adverse events. There were no obvious biases in the studies.
<ABS> This review has substantial limitations due to the unavailability of data from studies. Also there are no studies of other common OTC medications used for cough, such as antihistamines and antitussives.
<ABS> Thus, there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions on the role of OTC medications taken as an additional treatment for cough associated with acute pneumonia. Mucolytics may be beneficial but the lack of consistent evidence precludes recommending the routine use of mucolytics as an addition in the treatment of troublesome cough associated with pneumonia in children or adults. The evidence is current to January 2014.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the effect of tamponade agents used in surgery involving pars plana vitrectomy in participants with retinal detachment (RD) associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The retina is the light-sensing tissue in the back of the eye (similar to the film within a camera), and its normal function depends on its attachment to an underlying layer called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RD, a physical separation of the retina from the RPE, remains an important cause of visual loss. The macula is the centermost part of the retina and is responsible for central vision and perception of fine details. RD may or may not involve the macula, but patients with macular detachment typically have more severe visual loss than patients without macular detachment. RD is generally treated with surgery, but surgery is not always successful. In some patients surgery is initially successful but RD may recur months or years later. Most recurrent RDs, and some primary RDs, are associated with varying degrees of PVR, or the growth of fibrous membranes (similar to scar tissue) along the surface of the retina. The only proven therapy for RD with PVR is further surgery; where the membranes must be physically removed from the surface of the retina. In addition, injection of a material to hold the newly attached retina in position, called a tamponade agent, is performed to reduce the rate of fluid flow through open retinal tears, which would cause recurrent RD. The major tamponade agents that are available today are various gases and silicone oils.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 516 participants that compared tamponade agents. All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR. The Silicone Study compared the use of silicone oil to either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas in two RCTs. Both gases and silicone oil are less dense than water, so that they float upwards or towards the top of the eye while a patient is sitting or standing. This is sometimes but not always beneficial, so a denser-than-water silicone oil called heavy silicone oil has been investigated, primarily outside the US. The Heavy Silicone Oil Study compared the use of heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil in participants with RD involving the lower parts of the retina. The evidence was current to June 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When silicone oil was compared to SF6 gas, eyes randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year, and more often achieved macular attachment at one year but with no difference at two years. When silicone oil was compared with C3F8 gas, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity or macular attachment at one year. When heavy silicone oil was compared to standard silicone oil, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to retinal re-attachment or visual acuity at one year. Heavy silicone oil did not demonstrate any significant benefit over standard silicone oil. Adverse events were only reported for the Heavy Silicone Oil Study; however, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and the numbers for each group were not specified: of the 94 participants, there were four deaths, 26 recurrent RDs, 22 patients with glaucoma, four patients with cataract, and two patients with capsular fibrosis (scarring behind a lens implant).
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of these studies was moderately satisfactory. Although all trials employed proper randomization methods for participants, the masking of participants was unclear in all of the three RCTs, and masking of outcome assessors was not performed in two RCTs.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review included 516 participants from three RCTs. One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades. The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference).
<RES> All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors. The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias. All trials appear to be free of reporting bias. The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Tumours characterised by the presence of the HER2 protein are found in about one in five women with metastatic breast cancer. These tend to be more aggressive and the prognosis and choice of treatment are affected. Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a targeted biological drug (a monoclonal antibody) that attaches to the HER2 protein, blocking the growth of malignant cells.
<ABS> We included seven trials with 1497 women who had HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in this review. They were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline or capecitabine in four studies), hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors including letrozole or anastrozole in two studies) or targeted therapy (lapatinib in one study). Women treated with trastuzumab were followed up until disease progression in five studies and beyond disease progression in two studies. The length of trastuzumab administration varied between 8.7 and 30 months, and follow-up averaged two years after starting trastuzumab.
<ABS> Trastuzumab does not increase the risk of haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia; however, it seems to raise the risk of neutropenia. There were insufficient data on the impact of trastuzumab on quality of life, treatment-related deaths and brain metastases to reach a conclusion for these outcomes.
<ABS> We rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate, with the main weaknesses being the fact that all studies included were open-label (not blinded), which may have affected the outcome assessments for time to disease progression and toxicities, and that two studies have not published their results for mortality. Furthermore, the recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at disease progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab on mortality. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond disease progression is limited.
<ABS> It is important to highlight that, although trastuzumab is used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, the women enrolled in these metastatic trials were not previously treated with trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is still an open issue, although it is likely that it is offered to the majority of them.


<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The components of visual function essential for driving are acuity, static acuity, dynamic acuity, visual fields, visual attention, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. These indices are typically not fully assessed by licensing agencies. Also, current vision screening regulations and cut-off values required to pass a licensing test vary from country to country. Although there is a clear need to develop evidence-based and validated tools for vision screening for driving, the effectiveness of existing vision screening tools remains unclear. This represents an important and highly warranted initiative to increase road safety worldwide.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> It is common for palliative care patients to have reduced fluid intake during their illness. Management of this condition includes discussion with the patient, family and staff involved, and may include the provision of fluids with medical assistance. This can be performed using a small plastic tube inserted into a vein or under the skin, or via a tube inserted into the stomach. It is unknown whether this treatment helps people to feel better or live longer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted hydration in adults receiving palliative care. Randomised controlled trials allocate patients to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner and provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. We conducted the searches in April 2013 and March 2014.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> We found only six studies looking at this issue. The studies did not show a significant benefit in the use of medically assisted hydration in palliative care patients; however, there are insufficient good-quality studies to make any definitive recommendations. . As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Umckaloabo is a herbal extract derived from the plant Pelargonium sidoides (P. sidoides) and is available in both tablet and liquid forms. The extract is used for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) where antibiotic use is unnecessary. In the light of inappropriate antibiotic use and increasing drug resistance rates worldwide, the need for an alternative, effective remedy for these medical conditions is crucial. On the other hand, there are concerns as to the safety of Umckaloabo.
<ABS> Overall we considered the quality of the evidence low or very low for all major outcomes as there were few studies per disease entity, and all were from the same investigator (the manufacturer) and performed in the same region (Ukraine and Russia). Thus, in summary, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of P. sidoides in the treatment of ARIs. The evidence is up to date as of April 2013.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the efficacy and safety of P. sidoides for the treatment of ARIs in children and adults.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of 10 eligible studies eight were included in the analyses; two were of insufficient quality. Three trials (746 patients, low quality of evidence) of efficacy in acute bronchitis in adults showed effectiveness for most outcomes in the liquid preparation but not for tablets. Three other trials (819 children, low quality of evidence) showed similar results for acute bronchitis in children. For both meta-analyses, we did not pool subtotals due to relevant heterogeneity induced by type of preparation.
<RES> One study in patients with sinusitis (n = 103 adults, very low quality of evidence) showed significant treatment effects (complete resolution at day 21; RR 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.62). One study in the common cold demonstrated efficacy after 10 days, but not five days (very low quality of evidence). We rated the study quality as moderate for all studies (unvalidated outcome assessment, minor attrition problems, investigator-initiated trials only). Based on the funnel plot there was suspicion of publication bias.
<RES> There were no valid data for the treatment of other acute respiratory tract infections. Adverse events were more common with P. sidoides, but none were serious.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is uncomplicated malaria and how might artesunate-pyronaridine work
<ABS> Uncomplicated malaria is the milder form of malaria which usually causes fever, with or without headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can rapidly develop into severe malaria with kidney failure, fitting, unconsciousness, and eventually death. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common parasite causing malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and causes most of the severe malaria worldwide.
<ABS> The World Health Organization currently recommends countries use one of five different artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat malaria. These combinations contain an artemisinin component (artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or artesunate), which works quickly to clear the parasite from the person's blood, and a longer-acting drug which clears the remaining parasites from the blood and may prevent new Plasmodium infections for several weeks. Artesunate plus pyronaridine is a new combination and in this review we evaluate its effectiveness and safety compared to the other ACTs.
<ABS> After examining the research published up to 16 January 2014, we included six randomized controlled trials, enrolling 3718 children and adults.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Based on studies of mostly older children and adults living in Africa and Southeast Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artemether-lumefantrine at treating uncomplicated malaria and preventing further malaria infections after treatment (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> In a study primarily of older children and adults in Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating P. falciparum malaria and preventing recurrent parasitaemias (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Serious adverse events were rare in people treated with either artesunate-pyronaridine or other ACTs. However, short-lasting liver toxicity was more frequent in people treated with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Authors' conclusions
<ABS> Artesunate-pyronaridine performed well compared to the other two ACT with which it has been compared, but further studies in African and Asian children are required to help clarify whether this combination is an option for first-line treatment.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized controlled trials of artesunate-pyronaridine versus other ACTs in adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
<MaM> For the safety analysis, we also included adverse events data from trials comparing any treatment regimen containing pyronaridine with regimens not containing pyronaridine.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included six randomized controlled trials enrolling 3718 children and adults.
<RES> Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artemether-lumefantrine
<RES> Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<RES> Adverse effects
<RES> Serious adverse events were uncommon in these trials, with no difference detected between artesunate-pyronaridine and comparator ACTs. The analysis of liver function tests showed biochemical elevation were four times more frequent with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (RR 4.17, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.62, four trials, 3523 participants, moderate quality evidence).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Risk assessment tools for the prevention of pressure ulcers


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> In future, as the population ages, the number of people in our communities suffering with dementia will rise dramatically. This will not only affect the quality of life of people with dementia but also increase the burden on family caregivers, community care, and residential care services. Exercise one lifestyle factor identified as a potential means of reducing or delaying progression of the symptoms of dementia.
<ABS> Study Charateristics
<ABS> This review evaluated the results of 16 trials (search date August 2012), including 937 participants, that tested whether exercise programs could improve cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, depression, and mortality in older people with dementia or benefit their family caregivers.
<ABS> Key Findings
<ABS> There was promising evidence that exercise programs can significantly improve the cognitive functioning of people with dementia and their ability to perform daily activities, but there was a lot of variation between trial results that we were not able to explain. The studies showed no significant effect of exercise on mood. There was little or no evidence regarding the other outcomes listed above. Further well-designed research is required to examine these outcomes and to determine the best type of exercise program for people with different types and severity of dementia.
<ABS> Quality of Evidence
<ABS> Twelve additional trials were included in this updated review compared with the four included in the previous version of the review. As a result the number of participants increased to 937 at baseline and 798 (85.2%) completed the trials, compared with 280 at baseline and 208 (74%) completing the trials in our previous review. These are encouraging results. The number and quality of included trials were sufficient to address the first three objectives relating to the effect of exercise on cognition, ADLs, and depression. However, only one trial was included in the analyses of the effect of exercise on challenging behaviours and caregiver burden, and no analyses were completed for the following outcomes: mortality in people with dementia, caregiver quality of life, caregiver mortality, and use of healthcare services.
<ABS> The authors have no conflicts of interest.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms such as appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death. Although medication and psychological treatments are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression. However, head-to-head comparisons of such drugs provide contrasting findings as to whether they are effective.
<ABS> This review of the research on the effect of an antidepressant drug called paroxetine was conducted to shed light on the field of drug treatment for depression. In September 2012 we searched, in a wide ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials) which had been completed which compared paroxetine with any other antidepressant in treating people with depression. One hundred and fifteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 26,134 people. We grouped the studies according to the types of drug they compared paroxetine against; we then analysed the combined findings of these groups of studies.
<ABS> For the primary outcome (number of people who responded to treatment) paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine, but less effective than mirtazapine (in the early phase: one to four weeks follow-up) and probably citalopram (at endpoint: six weeks follow-up). There was some evidence that paroxetine is less well tolerated than agomelatine and St John's Wort, as more patients allocated to paroxetine experienced at least some side effects (though this finding for St John's Wort was only based on one study).
<ABS> In conclusion, some possibly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants exist, but no definitive concluions can be drawn due to the limited number of studies per comparison. In addition, most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, which means they might potentially have overestimated the effect of paroxetine. Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.
<OBJ> 2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.
<OBJ> 3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review looked at trials of inhaled epinephrine for the treatment of children with croup and is comprised of only eight studies with 225 participants. Of the eight included studies, six were assessed as having low risk of bias and two as unclear risk of bias (based upon assessment of adequate random sequence generation, allocations concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, and selective reporting). Studies assessed a variety of outcome measures and few studies examined the same outcomes; therefore, most outcomes contained data from a maximum of three studies, and in some cases only single studies.
<ABS> Compared to no medication, inhaled epinephrine improved croup symptoms in children at 30 minutes following treatment (three studies, 94 children). This treatment effect disappeared two hours after treatment (one study, 20 children). However, children's symptoms did not become worse than prior to treatment. No study measured adverse events.
<ABS> The evidence is current to July 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight studies (225 participants) were included. In general, children included in the studies were young (average age less than two years in the majority of included studies). Severity of croup was described as moderate to severe in all included studies. Six studies took place in the inpatient setting, one in the ED and one setting was not specified. Six of the eight studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias and the risk of bias was unclear in the remaining two studies.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature for studies up to March 2014. We searched for trials which compared middle ear infections in people randomly selected to receive zinc supplements or who did not receive supplements. We found 10 eligible studies, all conducted amongst young children. The total number of participants was 6820. Nine trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Seven trials were conducted on healthy children. Participants included both males and females.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The trial evidence included is generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. All the included trials included otitis media only as a secondary outcome. Therefore, there was a potential to miss trials which were less publicised or less well indexed within the electronic databases.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Blood thinners for the initial treatment of blood clots in patients with cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Patients with cancer are at an increased risk of blood clots. The blood thinner (anticoagulant) administered in the first few days can consist of unfractionated heparin (infused intravenously) or low molecular weight heparin (injected subcutaneously once or twice per day). These two blood thinners may have different effectiveness and safety profiles.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing different blood thinners in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of a blood clot. The trials looked at death, recurrent blood clots, bleeding, postphlebitic syndrome (a complication of long-term blood clots), quality of life and levels of blood platelets (which are involved in blood clotting). The evidence is current to February 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> In this systematic review, data from 13 studies suggest that low molecular weight heparin is superior to unfractionated heparin in reducing mortality. However, there is not enough evidence to prove superiority in reducing recurrence of blood clots. We did not find data to compare the safety profile of these two medications.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence was low.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food; production of material necessary for congealing, processing, and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood; and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut. Alcohol abuse and viral infections can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner. Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is unable to carry out the normal functions, which results in liver failure. Liver transplantation is effective in treating liver failure. However, liver transplantation is major surgical procedure and a significant proportion of people develop infective and wound complications because of the medications given to suppress the recipient body mounting a foreign body response to the liver graft (immunosuppressive regimens). Various interventions have been attempted to prevent the bacterial infective complications and wound complications; however, the effectiveness is unknown. We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (to February 2013) to determine the benefits and harms of different interventions to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in liver transplantation. We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only. When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence. Two review authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified seven trials for inclusion including 614 people. Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination (prolonged use of antibiotics to clear bacteria in the gut) versus placebo (inactive intervention) or no treatment. In one trial, people were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In one trial, probiotic with prebiotic was compared with prebiotic. In another trial, different doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; substance that stimulates the immune response) and placebo were compared. Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. There were five comparisons: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and G-CSF versus control. There was no trial comparing different antibiotics to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in people undergoing liver transplantation.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparisons. There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons. Overall, 193/611 (31.6%) participants developed infective complications. The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than prebiotics with probiotics group. There was no significant difference between the proportion of people who developed infection and the number of infective complication episodes between groups in any of the other comparisons. Quality of life and serious adverse events in the groups were not reported in any of the trials. There is no clear evidence that any of the interventions may be of benefit. Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the risk of infection compared to prebiotics with probiotics.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were at high risk of systematic errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance). The overall quality of evidence is very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in people undergoing liver transplantation. Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, quality of life, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events related to the treatment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to February 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified only seven trials for inclusion, including 614 participants. Only one trial was of low risk of bias risk. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low. There were five comparisons in the seven trials: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) versus control. Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination versus placebo or no treatment. In one trial, participants were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In one trial, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic) was compared with inactive lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic). In the remaining trial, different doses of G-CSF and placebo were compared. There was no trial comparing different antibiotic prophylactic regimens in people undergoing liver transplantation. Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation. There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparison groups.
<RES> Mortality
<RES> There were no differences between 190 participants (three trials); 5/87 (adjusted proportion: 6.2%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 7/103 (6.8%) in inactive control group; RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.72); 63 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR - not estimable; 64 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 0/65 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; and 194 participants (one trial); 22/124 (17.7%) in G-CSF group versus 10/70 (14.3%) in placebo group; RR 1.24 (95% 0.62 to 2.47).
<RES> Retransplantation
<RES> There were no differences between 132 participants (two trials); 4/58 (adjusted proportion: 6.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 6/74 (8.1%) in inactive control group; RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.85); 63 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 2.91 (0.12 to 68.81); 64 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.13 to 71.00); 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 1/65 (1.5%) in prebiotics group; RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.9); and 194 participants (one trial); 10/124 (7.1%) in G-CSF group versus 5/70 (7.1%) in placebo group; RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.17).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons. Overall, 193/611 participants (31.6%) developed infective complications. The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than in the prebiotics with probiotics group (1 study; 63 participants; 15/32 (46.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 (12.9%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 3.63; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.74 and 23/32 participants (0.72 infective complications per participant) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 participants (0.13 infective complications per participant) in prebiotics with probiotics group; rate ratio 5.58; 95% CI 1.94 to 16.09). There was no significant difference between the proportion of participants who developed infection and the number of infection episodes between the intervention group and control group in any of the other comparisons.
<RES> No trials reported quality of life and overall serious adverse events.

<H1> Atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A person with diseased arteries in the legs can experience pain on walking (also known as intermittent claudication), pain at rest (especially at night), or ulcers due to poor blood flow. Established treatments include surgery, where a bypass is inserted to carry blood from an artery above the diseased (blocked or narrowed) section to below the diseased section, and balloon angioplasty, where a deflated balloon is inserted into the vessel and then blown up to stretch the artery thus opening up the narrow or blocked section. Stents may be inserted during angioplasty. In addition to these two established treatments, a less commonly used technique is to core out the artery, cutting or grinding away the disease which is causing the vessel to narrow or block. This is known as atherectomy.
<ABS> In this review, we compared atherectomy to the more established treatments such as balloon angioplasty and bypass surgery. We identified four studies with a total of 220 participants. All studies compared atherectomy with balloon angioplasty. The studies were of low quality as there was no blinding of the procedures, the studies were not properly powered to show an effect, not all study outcomes were reported and a large number of the initial study populations did not complete the studies.
<ABS> We showed that the limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four trials were included with a total of 220 participants (118 treated with atherectomy, 102 treated with balloon angioplasty) and 259 treated vessels (129 treated with atherectomy, 130 treated with balloon angioplasty). All studies compared atherectomy with angioplasty. No study was properly powered or assessors blinded to the procedures and there was a high risk of selection, attrition, detection and reporting biases.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background on the condition
<ABS> The main findings of the review
<ABS> In nine clinical trials men were either given a dummy tablet (placebo, inactive drug), an alpha blocker for one to three days (in one study up to a maximum of eight days and in another for 32 days) or no treatment before the catheter was removed. In ideal circumstances, neither patients nor doctors knew which type of tablet was given, to prevent the bias in reporting the results. The results suggested that alpha blocker treatment increased the chances of successful catheter removal and return to urination although the overall scientific evidence available to support this was limited. Four different alpha blockers were tested (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin and silodosin). Their results were similar except for doxazosin which did not seem to make a significant difference.
<ABS> Adverse effects
<ABS> Side effects caused by alpha blockers were few and comparable to placebo or no treatment, though this evidence was limited. They included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting, sleepiness, feeling unwell and headache.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> There was some evidence to say that alpha blockers also reduce the risk of suffering another (recurrent) episode of urinary retention after successful catheter removal, though it remains unclear whether they reduce the need for future surgery on the prostate. It is therefore unclear whether, or for how long, alpha blocker treatment should be continued after successful catheter removal and whether the costs of alpha blocker treatment in such situations are justified. Further research is needed to answer these questions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Detoxification treatment for heroin dependents adolescents
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effect of detoxification treatment compared with pharmacological maintenance treatment or psychosocial intervention in achieving abstinence on adolescents heroin dependents.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the literature for randomised controlled trials investigating pharmacological interventions with or without psychosocial intervention aimed at detoxification in adolescents. They found only two trials, both conducted in the USA; one compared 28-day treatment with buprenorphine, using tablets placed under the tongue, to wearing a clonidine patch in 36 opiate dependent adolescents who were treated as outpatients. The other trial compared maintenance treatment versus detoxification treatment: buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance versus buprenorphine detoxification.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The trial comparing buprenorphine with clonidine reported a trend in favour of buprenorphine in reducing the drop-out rate but no difference between treatments in the duration and severity of withdrawal symptoms. More participants in the buprenorphine group went on to long-term naltrexone treatment. Side effects were not reported. In the second trial comparing buprenorphine maintenance versus buprenorphine for detoxification, for drop out the results were in favour of maintenance treatment, At one-year follow-
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review was limited by the very few number of trials retrieved and the quality of the evidence was moderate for the comparison between buprenorphine and clonidine and low for the comparison between buprenorphine detoxification and buprenorphine maintenance. The evidence is current to January 2014.

<H1> Heliox for croup in children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Helium-oxygen (heliox) treatment for croup in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Croup is an acute illness commonly seen in children up to six years of age but mostly by the age of two. It is triggered by viral infections causing upper airway obstruction with varying degrees of respiratory distress. Mostly, it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care. Croup is characterised by a barking cough, hoarseness, varying degrees of inspiratory stridor (abnormal breathing sound) and chest wall retractions and is usually preceded by one to three days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. The peak croup seasons are autumn and winter but can occur at any time.
<ABS> Corticosteroids are an accepted treatment for moderate to severe croup, supplemented in more severe cases by nebulised epinephrine and oxygen. Epinephrine is often effective and safe but can have undesired effects (such as increased heart rate and anxiety). Corticosteroids improve croup symptoms but it takes time for their full effect to be achieved. In the meantime the child remains at risk of deterioration. This may rarely result in the development of respiratory failure, which may require emergency intubation and ventilation. Therefore, finding a safe and effective treatment to bridge the gap between the administration and effectiveness of the corticosteroids is important for clinical practice.
<ABS> Some studies have shown a benefit of using heliox in children with croup. Heliox, a gas with lower density than air or oxygen, is believed to reduce the resistance to gas flow in narrowed upper airways, potentially improving symptoms and signs of respiratory distress. This review found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of heliox in 91 children with croup. Heliox did not appear to be more effective than administration of 30% oxygen in children with mild croup. In children with moderate to severe croup who had been administered oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, heliox appeared to be at least as effective as continuous 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine (adrenaline as a fine spray) in one study. It was slightly more effective than no treatment in another study. There were no adverse effects or outcomes reported. The included trials were small and had a number of methodological limitations. Further methodologically well-designed RCTs with more participants are needed to further assess the role of heliox in managing children with moderate to severe croup. The evidence is current to November 2013.

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antiviral medicines for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PHN is a painful condition that can occur after shingles (herpes zoster) in the area where the rash occurred. Many people with PHN find that treatments work only a little or not at all. Attention has therefore turned to stopping the development of PHN. Some people suggested that medicines that target the virus that causes shingles (antiviral medicines), given at the time of the rash, might prevent PHN. The aim of this review was to assess the whether antiviral medicines are able to prevent PHN.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified six clinical trials that met our standards for inclusion in the review. They included a total of 1319 participants. We decided that our main measure of whether antiviral medicines work in preventing PHN would be whether or not PHN had developed six months after a first attack of shingles (some of the studies we included of aciclovir measured PHN at four months).
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> Aciclovir, which is an antiviral medicine, was used in five trials (900 participants) and was not better than a placebo (dummy pill) in preventing PHN. In the other trial (419 participants), famciclovir, which is another antiviral drug, was no better than placebo in preventing pain following healing of the shingles rash. The number of side effects with aciclovir and famciclovir was not very different from the number with placebo. The trials did not have any major problems of design or conduct that put the results in doubt, although most of the reports did not provide enough information to fully assess every aspect. We conclude that according to high quality evidence, oral aciclovir was ineffective in reducing the incidence of PHN and there is not enough evidence on other antiviral treatments. There need to be further well-designed trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents with a greater number of participants. Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should include different groups of people, such as those who have lowered immunity.
<ABS> The evidence is current to April 2013, when the searches were last updated. Because new evidence on this topic is slow to emerge, we have scheduled the next update of this review for 2017.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are rare ovarian tumours (2% to 5% of all ovarian cancers). Most ovarian tumours arise from the outer surface layer of the ovary, but GCTs arise from granulosa cells (sex cord cells) within the ovaries that produce oestrogen (primary female sex hormones). These tumours grow relatively slowly and can recur 10 to 15 years after primary treatment. If women with these tumours want to have children, the surgeon usually removes only the diseased ovary. However, standard treatment has consisted of surgery to remove tubes, ovaries and uterus, as most women develop GCTs around the time of the menopause, when fertility is no longer a matter of concern.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Previous studies have assessed chemotherapy (different combination regimens) with or without radiotherapy following surgery. This review aimed to examine the effects of various treatment methods, including fertility-sparing surgery, on the survival of women with GCT of the ovary.
<ABS> Main findings
<ABS> Five retrospective studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Two studies, which attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), suggested that no apparent evidence could be found of differences in overall survival between surgical approaches (including whether the surgery was keyhole or open) whether a patient underwent lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all women combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.
<ABS> One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent only surgery. In three studies, no apparent evidence to suggest that disease recurrence was associated with type of adjuvant chemotherapy or type of surgery, although surgical staging may be important. In one study, disease recurrence was not noted to be different between patients who underwent fertility-sparing surgery, where only the affected fallopian tube and ovary were removed, and those treated with conventional surgery, in which both tubes and ovaries were removed. Given the high overall survival rate, fertility-sparing surgery may be an important treatment option for young patients wishing to have children in the future. Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study.
<ABS> Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life. All studies were at very high risk of bias (low quality).
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> All five studies were retrospective (looked at past findings) and were at very high risk of bias (low quality); therefore future studies should look at current evidence in randomised studies on adult GCT of the ovary. Three randomised studies comparing chemotherapy are ongoing. The study that may be able to answer the question regarding best choice of chemotherapy in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised study comparing the efficacy of two drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus standard chemotherapy (BEP - bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin).
<ABS> Overall, the evidence in this review is of low quality, which may seriously weaken confidence in the results. Further research is very likely to have an important impact on evidence provided in the future. The effectiveness and safety of different ways of treating patients with adult-onset granulosa cell tumour of the ovary have not yet been assessed by high-quality studies. Such trials are required to assess toxicity and quality of life associated with different treatments and to assess the safety of the types of surgery used. Generally, current evidence is not robust enough to allow recommendations for changes in clinical practice.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five retrospective cohort studies (535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) that used appropriate statistical methods for adjustment were included in the review.
<RES> Two studies, which carried out multivariate analyses that attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), reported no apparent evidence of a difference in overall survival between surgical approaches, whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Only percentage of survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.
<RES> Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies. None of the five studies reported on quality of life (QoL). All studies were at very high risk of bias.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Low pressure versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver produces bile, which has many functions, including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. Bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult Western population. Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic within a year. Symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin-secreting cells that maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally performed by inflating the tummy with carbon dioxide gas to permit the organs and structures within the tummy to be viewed so that the surgery can be performed. The gas pressure used to inflate the tummy is usually 12 mm Hg to 16 mm Hg (standard pressure). However, this causes alterations in the blood circulation and may be detrimental. To overcome this, lower pressure has been suggested as an alternative to standard pressure. However, using lower pressure may limit the surgeon's view of the organs and structures within the tummy, possibly resulting in inadvertent damage to the organs or structures. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy using low pressure or standard pressure. A systematic search of medical literature was performed to identify studies that provided information on the above question. The review authors obtained information from randomised trials only because such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A total of 1092 patients were studied in 21 trials. Patients were assigned to a low pressure group (509 patients) or a standard pressure group (583 patients). The choice of treatment was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin. Most of the trials included low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully using low pressure in approximately 90% of people undergoing this procedure. No deaths were reported in either low pressure or standard pressure groups in eight trials that reported deaths (total of 434 patients in both groups). Seven trials with 394 patients described complications related to surgery. One participant experienced the outcome of serious adverse events (low pressure group 1/179, 0.6%; standard pressure group 0/215, 0%). Quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work were not reported in any of the trials. The difference in the percentage of people undergoing conversion to open operation (from key-hole operation) between the low pressure group (2/269; 0.8%) and the standard pressure group (2/287; 0.7%) was imprecise. This was reported in 10 studies. No difference was noted in the length of hospital stay between the groups. Operating time was about two minutes longer (very low quality evidence) in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group. Currently no evidence is available to support the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum in low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum has to be established.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Only one trial including 140 participants was at low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of study design). The remaining 20 trials were at high risk of bias (high chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of trial design). The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials are necessary, particularly in high surgical risk patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 27 studies (1549 participants) that were eligible for inclusion. These studies provided no data relating to aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi or ARB (or both) on patient-level outcomes including major cardiovascular events and mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation.
<RES> However, we found that aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on GFR (9 studies, 528 participants; MD -2.55 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.67 to 0.51), doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, 632 patients): RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 7.2, 95% CI 3.4 to ∞) and increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared to ACEi or ARB (or both) (4 studies, 281 patients): RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23; NNTH: 14.1, 95% CI 8.7 to 37.3).
<RES> Most studies enrolled few patients (range 12 to 268) and were powered to observe differences in surrogate end points rather than patient-focused outcomes. Nine studies had a cross-over design and the majority of studies did not adequately report study methods to assess methods and study quality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as a port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered to be less painful than open surgery, pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent people from feeling pain) into the surgical wound (local anaesthetic wound infiltration) may be an effective way of decreasing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the benefits and harms of local anaesthetic wound infiltration is not known. We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials on the benefits related to the treatment. When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. We also considered comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms. Two authors searched the literature until February 2013 and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 19 randomised clinical trials in this review. Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> A total of 1095 participants were randomised to local anaesthetic wound infiltration (587 participants) or no local anaesthetic wound infiltration (508 participants) in 17 trials. The choice of whether the participants received local anaesthetic agents (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments were compared in groups of patients who were as similar as possible. There were no deaths in either group in the seven trials (539 participants) that reported deaths. The difference in serious complications between the groups was imprecise. There were no local anaesthetic-related complications in nearly 450 participants who received local anaesthetic wound infiltration in the different trials that reported complications. None of the trials reported quality of life or the time taken to return to work. The proportion of participants who were discharged as day surgery patients was higher in the local anaesthetic group than in the control group in the only trial that reported this information. The difference in the length of hospital stay or the time taken to return to normal activity was imprecise. Pain was lower in the participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration compared with those in the control groups at four to eight hours and at nine to 24 hours, as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart which rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10). In the comparisons of different methods of local anaesthetic infiltration, there were differences between the groups in some outcomes but the changes were not consistent. There is, therefore, no evidence to prefer any particular drug or method of administering local anaesthetics. Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic wound infiltration. There is very low quality evidence that infiltration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were at high risk of bias, that is there is a possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions by overestimating the benefits or underestimating the harms of one method over another because of the way a study was conducted. The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary. Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, hospital stay, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-six trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review. All the 26 trials except one trial of 30 participants were at high risk of bias. Nineteen of the trials with 1263 randomised participants provided data for this review. Ten of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control. One of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration with two inactive controls, normal saline and no intervention. Two of the 19 trials had four arms comparing local anaesthetic wound infiltration with inactive controls in the presence and absence of co-interventions to decrease pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Four of the 19 trials had three or more arms that could be included for the comparison of local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control and different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration. The remaining two trials compared different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration.
<RES> Four trials randomised a total of 149 participants to local anaesthetic wound infiltration prior to skin incision (74 participants) versus local anaesthetic wound infiltration at the end of surgery (75 participants). Two trials randomised a total of 176 participants to four different local anaesthetics (bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, neosaxitoxin). Although there were differences between the groups in some outcomes the changes were not consistent. There was no evidence to support the preference of one local anaesthetic over another or to prefer administration of local anaesthetic at a specific time compared with another.

<H1> Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> For women with early breast cancer, removal of the tumour followed by radiation therapy (RT) allows the breast to be kept (breast conserving therapy). A tumour occurring again within the breast can be either a true recurrence (arising in the same area of the breast as the original cancer) or a new primary cancer (another breast cancer arising in another part of the breast). RT reduces the risk of a true recurrence but does not prevent the development of a new primary cancer.
<ABS> RT usually involves treating the whole breast (WBRT) in four to six weeks of daily treatments. This can be costly and inconvenient for women and their families. This can mean women choose mastectomy (removal of the breast) to avoid RT. RT delivered only to the area of the breast from which the tumour was removed (partial breast irradiation: PBI) offers the potential for preservation of the breast if the tumour then occurs in a previously untreated part of the breast. If RT is also delivered over a shorter period of time (accelerated partial breast irradiation: APBI) than WBRT, fewer visits to the RT department are required, reducing inconvenience for the woman who is treated.
<ABS> In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the role of PBI and APBI against WBRT.
<ABS> We included four completed trials: one had a short follow-up so the information is not mature enough yet, two trials involved RT techniques that do not meet today's standards, and the other trial stopped early. The evidence is current to April 2014. We found local relapse-free survival appeared worse with PBI/APBI than WBRT. When PBI/APBI was compared with WBRT the rates of overall survival were similar, but we could not exclude potentially important differences between treatment groups. This was also the case for the effects of PBI/APBI on cause-specific survival, distant metastasis-free survival, subsequent mastectomy rate and relapse-free survival when PBI/APBI was compared with WBRT. We found no data for: acute toxicity, costs, quality of life or consumer preference. Breast appearance was better with PBI/APBI in a single trial but late adverse events were increased in another trial.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence (low to very low) means we cannot make any recommendations about the benefit of or best way to deliver PBI/APBI. We would only advise the use of PBI/APBI in a trial. We found seven ongoing trials which do reflect modern RT practice and await their completion; it may be possible to answer these questions in a future update of this review.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pain following surgical procedures can sometimes increase the incidence of complications in the body. It is important to manage this pain effectively. Major shoulder surgery can cause severe pain. Effectively treating this pain will help reduce complications and will promote early mobilization. A wide range of methods are used to treat pain after major shoulder surgery, including administration of opioid (derived from opium) and non-opioid pain killers and administration of drugs that produce numbness and hence pain relief in and around the shoulder joint or around the nerves supplying the upper limb. We compared the usefulness of a continuous upper limb nerve block performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the neck close to where the nerves originate (interscalene brachial plexus block—ISBPB group) with the administration of opioid pain killers into a vein, into a muscle or under the skin (any route other than by mouth)—the parenteral opioid group.
<ABS> Evidence obtained is current to December 2012. We included two studies involving 147 participants. Seventeen participants were excluded (16 from the ISBPB group and one from the other), leaving 130 participants: 66 in the ISBPB group and 64 in the parenteral opioid group. The studies were of medium to low quality because of issues with study design, and one of the trials was sponsored by a drug company.
<ABS> The severity of pain was assessed by the patient using a numerical scale on which zero was considered as no pain and 10 or 100 as the worst imaginable pain for 72 hours in one study and 48 hours in the other. The severity of postoperative pain was significantly less for the ISBPB group at all time points in one study and at all but one time point in the other study.
<ABS> No concrete conclusions can be drawn because of the small number of studies, which were not of high quality. However, from the available evidence, it can be seen that in one of the trials, the requirement for additional painkiller (piritramide) was significantly higher in the parenteral opioid group, whereas the other trial did not mention this. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly less in the ISBPB group when compared with the parenteral opioid group. Complications related to ISBPB were virtually eliminated when ultrasound was used to perform ISBPB.

<H1> Fewer-than-four ports versus four ports for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Fewer-than-four ports versus four ports for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult Western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the main stay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a key-hole-sized incision, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. In conventional or standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key hole removal of gallbladder), four ports (two of 10-mm diameter and two of 5-mm diameter) are usually used. The use of fewer ports has been reported (fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy). However, the safety of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy and whether it offers any advantages over four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known. We sought to answer this question by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials commonly called randomised controlled trials. When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information. Two review authors searched the literature to September 2013 and obtained information from the trials, thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified nine trials that compared fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In these nine studies, 855 participants were included. Four hundred and twenty seven participants underwent fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy while the remaining 428 participants underwent four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The choice of the treatment that the participants received was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin so that the two treatments were given to participants with similar characteristics. Most of these studies included low anaesthetic risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 90% of participants in most of the trials. The remaining participants were mostly converted to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some participants had to undergo open cholecystectomy (through a large incision in the abdomen). There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (634 participants in the two groups). There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications, quality of life between 10 and 30 days after operation, proportion of participants in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy, or in the length of hospital stay between the groups. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy took about 15 minutes longer to complete than four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The time taken to return to normal activity was one day shorter and time taken to return to work two days shorter in the fewer-than-four-ports group compared with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There was no significant difference in the cosmetic appearance between the two groups at 6 to 12 months after surgery. There appears to be no advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of decreasing surgical complications, hospital stay, or in improving quality of life and cosmetic appearance. In contrast, the safety of fewer-than-four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is yet to be established. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be recommended routinely outside well-designed clinical trials.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions because of the way that the trial was conducted. The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials (which have low probability to arrive at wrong conclusions because of chance and because of participant or researcher prejudice) are necessary to determine whether fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and whether there is any advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy over four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found nine trials with 855 participants that randomised participants to fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 427) versus four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 428). Most trials included low anaesthetic risk participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Seven of the nine trials used a single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the remaining two trials used three-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the experimental intervention. Only one trial including 70 participants had low risk of bias. Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 90% of participants in most trials. The remaining participants were mostly converted to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some participants had to undergo open cholecystectomy.


<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three trials in this review with 354 participants. No new trials were included in this update.


<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to spontaneous, excessive neuronal discharge manifesting as seizures. It is a common disorder with an incidence of 50 per 100,000 per year and a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% (Hauser 1993) in the developed world.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials comparing IR CBZ to CR CBZ in patients commencing monotherapy and patients presently treated with IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (GP, MS) independently extracted the data and recorded relevant information on a standardised data extraction form. Results were assessed for inclusion.
<MaM> The heterogeneity of the included trials resulted in only a narrative, descriptive analysis being possible for both the categorical and time-to-event data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review. One trial included patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and nine included patients on treatment with IR CBZ.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency.
<CON> Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review included four trials involving 3972 women and their babies, and found that there is little high-quality evidence on the effects of screening for GDM on health outcomes for mothers and their babies. One trial compared risk factor screening with universal screening, and three trials evaluated different methods of administering a 50 g glucose load (the glucose load is used during the screening test). In one trial, women who were in the universal screening group were more likely to be diagnosed with GDM compared with women in the high-risk screening group. However, this trial was not of high quality. Few other differences between groups were shown in any of the trials. Further research is required to see which recommendations for screening practices for GDM are most appropriate.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different methods of screening for GDM.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question
<ABS> We wanted to assess the effectiveness of training, exercises or other interventions aimed at helping people who have had a stroke stand up independently from a sitting position, compared with usual care or no intervention.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Rising to stand from sitting is one of the most frequently performed tasks of daily living and is something people need to be able to do to start walking. After a stroke, people may have difficulty rising to stand from sitting. This review looked at the effect of training or exercises on ability to rise to stand, and also aimed to look at the effect of different chair positions that might help people rise to stand.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 13 studies up to June 2013. These studies included 603 participants who had had a stroke. Twelve of the studies investigated the effect of different types of training or exercise: six studies (276 participants) investigated repetitive sit-to-stand training, four studies (264 participants) investigated an exercise training programme that included sit-to-stand training, one study (12 participants) included a training programme (sitting training) aiming to improve sit-to-stand, and one study (42 participants) investigated feedback (information about the symmetry of weight taken through the feet) during sit-to-stand. One of the studies investigated the effect of starting posture for sit-to-stand: this study (nine participants) compared sit-to-stand with a cane and without a cane. This study measured people during three tests of rising to stand with a cane, and three tests of rising to stand without a cane; there was no training period.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions. However, we found moderate quality evidence, from a relatively low number of small studies, that interventions to improve sit-to-stand may have a beneficial effect on the speed of rising to stand and the weight taken through the affected leg. We found insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions about the effect of sit-to-stand training on other outcomes. We recommend large clinical trials to confirm the results of this review, and to investigate the effects of different numbers of repetitions and durations of therapy. Future studies should include a measure of functional ability, and should measure long-term outcomes as well as outcomes straight after therapy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirteen studies (603 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review, and data from 11 of these studies were included within meta-analyses. Twelve of the 13 included studies investigated rehabilitation interventions; one (nine participants) investigated the effect of altered starting posture for sit-to-stand. We judged only four studies to be at low risk of bias for all methodological parameters assessed. The majority of randomised controlled trials included participants who were already able to sit-to-stand or walk independently.
<RES> Only one study (48 participants), which we judged to be at high risk of bias, reported our primary outcome of interest, ability to sit-to-stand independently, and found that training increased the odds of achieving independent sit-to-stand compared with control (odds ratio (OR) 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 16.50, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Interventions or training for sit-to-stand improved the time taken to sit-to-stand and the lateral symmetry (weight distribution between the legs) during sit-to-stand (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.06, seven studies, 335 participants; and SMD 0.85; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33, five studies, 105 participants respectively, both moderate quality evidence). These improvements are maintained at long-term follow-up.
<RES> Few trials assessing the effect of sit-to-stand training on peak vertical ground reaction force (one study, 54 participants) and functional ability (two studies, 196 participants) were identified, providing very low and low quality evidence respectively.
<RES> The effect of sit-to-stand training on number of falls was imprecise, demonstrating no benefit or harm (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, five studies, 319 participants, low quality evidence). We judged the majority of studies that assessed falls to be at high risk of bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cataract, a cloudy lens within the eye, is a major complication in people with uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye). Different types of artificial lenses (intraocular lenses, IOLs) are available to insert into the eye after removal of the cloudy natural lens during cataract surgery. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effects of different artificial lenses in adults with uveitis.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature up to August 2013 and identified four randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) containing 216 participants investigating different lens types. Lens materials studied were acrylic, silicone, heparin surface modified, and poly(methyl methacrylate). The trials included participants with different causes of uveitis, compared different lens types, and reported different outcomes. Due to these differences across trials, no meta-analysis (pooling of trial data) was performed. The largest trial (140 participants) was funded by a professional society. The other three trials did not report their funding sources.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is very limited evidence on which to determine the effects of different types of lens materials for people with uveitis. The results from the largest trial provide only preliminary evidence that acrylic lenses may perform better than silicone lenses in terms of improving vision and reducing the chances of post-surgical inflammation and complications. At this time, there is not enough data to conclude whether additional types of lenses are preferable to other types.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Because the trials included small numbers of participants in each of the four lens-type groups, there is uncertainty in the results of the studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs involving 216 participants (range of 2 to 140 participants with uveitic cataract per trial) and comparing up to four types of IOLs. The largest study was an international study with centers in Brazil, Egypt, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the USA; two studies were conducted in Germany and one in Saudi Arabia. There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the ages of participants and etiologies of uveitis within and across studies. The length of follow-up among the studies ranged from 1 to 24 months after cataract surgery. The studies were at low risk of selection bias, but two of the four studies did not employ masking and only one study included all randomized participants in the final analyses. The funding source was disclosed by investigators of the largest study (professional society) and not reported by the other three. Due to heterogeneity in lens types evaluated and outcomes reported among the trials, we did not combine data in a meta-analysis.
<RES> In the largest study (140 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive one of four types of IOLs: hydrophobic acrylic, silicone, HSM PMMA, or unmodified PMMA. Proportions of participants with one or more Snellen lines of visual improvement were similar among the four treatment groups at one year' follow-up: 45 of 48 (94%) in the hydrophobic acrylic IOL group, 39 of 44 (89%) in the silicone IOL group, 18 of 22 (82%) in the HSM PMMA IOL group, and 22 of 26 (85%) in the unmodified PMMA IOL group. When comparing hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with silicone IOLs, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.20). At one year' follow-up, fewer eyes randomized to hydrophobic acrylic IOLs developed posterior synechiae when compared with eyes receiving silicone IOLs (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79); the effects between these groups were less certain with respect to developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.37), corneal edema (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12), cystoid macular edema (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.84), or mild IOL decentration (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.22).
<RES> Two intra-individual studies also compared HSM PMMA IOLs with unmodified PMMA IOLs at three or six months of follow-up. These studies, including a combined total of 16 participants with uveitis, were insufficiently powered to detect differences in outcomes among eyes of people with uveitis randomized to receive HSM PMMA IOLs when compared with fellow eyes receiving unmodified PMMA IOLs.
<RES> In the fourth study (60 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive a hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOL. At three months, there were no statistical or clinical differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOL types in the proportions of participants with two or more Snellen lines of visual improvement (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.22). There were similar rates in the development of PCO between hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOLs at six months' follow-up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25). The effect of the lenses on posterior synechiae was uncertain at six months' follow-up (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.22).
<RES> None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes.

<H1> Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The use of regular vitamin D preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of the most recent search: 08 July 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies (239 participants) are included, although only three studies provided data from 69 adults and children with cystic fibrosis for analysis. One study compared a single high dose of vitamin D (250,000 IU) to placebo at the time of hospital admission with a respiratory exacerbation in 30 pancreatic insufficient adults with cystic fibrosis. The second study compared supplemental 800 international units (IU) vitamin D and placebo for 12 months in 30 osteopenic pancreatic insufficient adults; both groups continued 900 IU vitamin D daily. The third study compared supplemental 1 g calcium alone, 1600 IU vitamin D alone, 1600 IU vitamin D and 1 g calcium and placebo in a double-blind randomised cross-over study; only nine children who completed both vitamin D and placebo groups after six-months supplementation and a three-month washout period are included; pancreatic sufficiency or disease status of participants are not defined. The studies are not directly comparable due to differences in supplementation, outcome reporting and possibly participant characteristics (e.g. severity of lung disease, growth and nutrition, pancreatic sufficiency).
<RES> The only outcome for which we could combine data from more than two studies was 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had significantly higher levels, mean difference 7.24 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 5.01 to 9.46). However, ironically one study reported 1,25(OH)2D with levels significantly favouring the placebo group, mean difference -30.30 pmol/ml (95% confidence interval -59.89 to -0.71). Bone mineral density was measured in two studies; both described no significant change between groups. There were no adverse events in any study.
<RES> The remaining three studies are published as abstracts only and did not provide data for analysis. These abstracts include: a report of pre-intervention data in a study comparing daily calcitriol (0.25 or 0.5 micrograms) with placebo in pancreatic insufficient children and young adults; an interim report of a double-blind randomised control study comparing 5000 IU vitamin D daily for 12 weeks during winter in 67 adult cystic fibrosis patients; and a comparison of the effect of three months of vitamin D supplementation (dose not specified) with placebo on bone mineral density in 42 children with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density.
<RES> Risk of bias was highly variable between all studies. Only one study had a low risk of bias for the five main criteria (random sequence generation, allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting). The rest of the studies had unclear or high risks of bias. Two studies had a low risk of bias for blinding and another two studies for attrition bias. In the studies published as abstracts, assessment of the risks of bias was uncertain in many aspects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Some degree of kidney failure affects about 15% to 25% of people and is a silent disease that creeps up on an individual with symptoms and signs developing only very late. When kidney failure becomes end-stage, life supporting therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation is the only option available for the patient. This form of therapy is very expensive and highly intrusive into the patients' life. Measures to prevent progression to this terminal stage are of great importance to prevent this catastrophe.
<ABS> Our analyses of 40 studies of people with chronic kidney disease shows that people referred earlier to a specialist kidney doctor lived longer. Death rates in people referred early were about half of those referred late and these benefits were seen as early as three months and lasted for at least five years. People referred early also spent less time in hospital and were better prepared for dialysis. Dialysis first requires surgical placement of a fistula and early referral to specialist services often means better preparation, a lower risk of infection and other complications.
<ABS> We did not discover any adverse effects from early specialist referral. Randomised controlled trials provide the most reliable information of all study designs, so it should be noted that all 40 studies analysed for this review used a cohort design. Cohort studies are the next best level of evidence and the only available evidence. For ethical reasons it is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial that deliberately assigns patients to late specialist referral will ever be conducted.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No RCTs or quasi-RCTs were identified. There were 40 longitudinal cohort studies providing data on 63,887 participants; 43,209 (68%) who were referred early and 20,678 (32%) referred late.
<RES> Comparative mortality was higher in patients referred to specialist services late versus those referred early. Risk ratios (RR) for mortality reductions in patients referred early were evident at three months (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.67; I² = 84%) and remained at five years (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71; I² = 87%). Initial hospitalisation was 9.12 days shorter with early referral (95% CI -10.92 to -7.32 days; I² = 82%) compared to late referral. Pooled analysis showed patients referred early were more likely than late referrals to initiate RRT with peritoneal dialysis (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.64 to 1.84; I² = 92%).
<RES> The quality of the included studies was assessed as being low to moderate based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Slight differences in the definition of early versus late referral infer some risk of bias. Generally, heterogeneity in most of the analyses was high.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole incision, also known as a port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered less painful than open surgery, pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) into the tummy (abdomen) may be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the benefits and harms of intra-abdominal administration of local anaesthetics is unknown. We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials with regards to benefits and other comparative study designs for treatment-related harms. When conducted correctly, randomised clinical studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. Two review authors searched the literature and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 58 trials, of which 48 randomised clinical trials involving 2849 people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy contributed data to one or more of the outcomes. Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The choice of whether the participants received local anaesthetic agents (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in people who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in eight trials (446 participants) that reported deaths. The studies reported very few or no serious complications in the groups. There were no local anaesthetic-related complications in nearly 1000 participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in the different trials that reported complications. None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work. The small differences in hospital stay between the two groups were imprecise. Pain scores were lower in the participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration compared with those who received controls at four to eight hours and at nine to 24 hours as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10).
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that means that there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the study was conducted. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Serious adverse event rates were low in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration (very low quality evidence). There is very low quality evidence that local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary. Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The effect of local anaesthetic instillation on the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with benefit and no difference of intervention (three trials; 242 participants; 89/160 (adjusted proportion 61.0%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 40/82 (48.8%) in control group; RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58; very low quality evidence). The MD in length of hospital stay was 0.04 days (95% CI -0.23 to 0.32; five trials; 335 participants; low quality evidence). The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) were significantly lower in the local anaesthetic instillation group than the control group at four to eight hours (32 trials; 2020 participants; MD -0.99 cm; 95% CI -1.10 to -0.88 on a VAS scale of 0 to 10 cm; very low quality evidence) and at nine to 24 hours (29 trials; 1787 participants; MD -0.53 cm; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.44; very low quality evidence). Various subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to investigate the influence of the different local anaesthetic agents, different methods of local anaesthetic instillation, and different controls on the effectiveness of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation were inconsistent.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Prophylactic antibiotics for penetrating abdominal trauma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> No randomised controlled trials could be found that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Therefore, there is no evidence to unequivocally support or refute this practice. Current guidelines are based on expert opinion rather than fact.
<ABS> We recommend that a randomised controlled trial be designed to assess which patients would benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, and which patients would not. Hopefully this would result in less unnecessary antibiotic use, and thus less antibiotic resistance.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials, with a combined total of 1439 women in the review; each trial examined a different method of induction and we were unable to pool the results from trials.
<RES> 1. Vaginal PGE2 (two studies including 1028 women). There were no differences between women managed as outpatients versus inpatients for most review outcomes. There was no evidence of a difference between the likelihood of women requiring instrumental delivery in either setting (risk ratio (RR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.13). The overall length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups.
<RES> 3. Foley catheter (one study including 111 women). There was no evidence of differences between groups for caesarean section rates, total induction time and the numbers of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Cochrane review authors performed this systematic review to assess the effect of the addition of adherence compounds such as fibrin sealant and hyaluronic acid (HA) on pregnancy outcomes.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Seventeen randomised controlled trials (3898 participants) were included in the review. One studied fibrin sealant, and the other 16 studied HA. These studies took place in Israel, the United States of America, Turkey, Taiwan, Germany, Switzerland, Iran, Slovenia, Austria and Hungary. Investigators compared embryo transfer in a medium containing high versus low or no hyaluronic acid and in a medium containing fibrin sealant versus transfer in a medium with no fibrin sealant. Outcomes reported included live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, implantation rates, multiple pregnancy rates and other adverse events. The mean age of the women ranged from 27.5 to 35.7 years. The evidence gathered is current to November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Analysis of the 16 studies that were identified using functional concentrations of HA showed an increase in the chances of pregnancy and live birth (450 vs 367 per 1000) but also an increase in the chance of the more risky outcome of multiple pregnancy (282 vs 175 per 1000). This increase in multiple pregnancy rate may be the result of improved pregnancy outcomes due to the addition of the adherence compound and the policy of transferring more than one embryo back into the uterus.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence obtained for these comparisons was of moderate quality. It is important to note that evidence of a higher delivery rate was not found in all analyses; however, it was found in the overall meta-analysis. Based on the single identified study that used fibrin sealant, no evidence indicates that the addition of this compound to an embryo transfer medium improved pregnancy outcomes.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Beta-blockers are a class of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Nonselective beta-blockers are a subclass of beta-blockers including propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), etc. We asked how much this subclass of drugs lower blood pressure.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We developed a comprehensive search strategy of all relevant scientific databases to identify all clinical trials to answer this question. Participants had to have a baseline systolic blood pressure (the top number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 90 mmHg, or both of these. We did not restrict participants by age, gender, baseline risk or any other medical conditions.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is low due to the presence of extreme outliers and high risk of biases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Pericyazine for schizophrenia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Pericyazine for the treatment of schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). The first line and mainstay of treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs. These antipsychotic drugs can be grouped into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation). Pericyazine is a relatively old antipsychotic formulated in 1961. Some studies have suggested that it may be of more benefit than other antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> This review aims to assess the effectiveness of pericyazine in the treatment of schizophrenia compared to older and newer antipsychotics.A search for studies was carried out in 2013 and five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980 were found and included in the review. The quality of evidence was rated by the authors to be very low, and their results were imprecise for many outcomes where they compared pericyazine and other older and newer antipsychotic drugs. The evidence is inadequate to determine whether pericyazine is better than other antipsychotics.
<ABS> The results of the analysis for the outcome of improvement were imprecise and the authors could not be certain that more people who took pericyazine were found to have not improved compared with those who took typical antipsychotics. More side effects, such as involuntary shaking, tremors, restlessness and spasms, were experienced by people who took pericyazine than other typical or atypical antipsychotics. These side effects are very unpleasant and the increased occurrence of them compared to other antipsychotics is an important finding considering pericyazine may not have additional benefits for the symptoms of schizophrenia.
<ABS> No studies reported outcomes on satisfaction of treatment or cost effectiveness, which require attention. This lack of evidence leaves people with schizophrenia, mental health professionals and policy makers with little information on the benefits, hazards or problems of pericyazine. Outcomes on the cost of care and satisfaction with treatment should be included in future trials which should also be larger, better conducted, and fully reported.
<ABS> (This plain language summary has been written by Ben Gray from Rethink Mental Illness).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980. Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting.
<RES> For the primary outcome of Global state - not improved, the confidence interval was compatible with a small benefit and increased risk of not improving with pericyazine compared with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 122, RR 1.24 CI 0.93 to 1.66, very low quality of evidence) or atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.97 CI 0.67 to 1.42, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> When compared with typical antipsychotics relapse was only experienced by one person taking pericyazine (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 2.59 CI 0.11 to 61.75, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> Pericyazine was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics (3 RCTs, n = 163, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, very low quality of evidence) and atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 2.69 CI 1.35 to 5.36, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> The estimated risk of leaving the study early for specific reasons was imprecise for the comparisons of pericyazine with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 71, RR 0.46 CI 0.11 to 1.90, very low quality of evidence), and with atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.13 CI 0.01 to 2.42, very low quality of evidence).


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Single dose oral dexibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A series of reviews looks at how good pain killers are. This review looks at a drug called dexibuprofen. This is a form of ibuprofen. It is thought to give the same pain relief at a lower dose.
<ABS> We found two clinical trials with 313 people. Dexibuprofen at 200 mg or 400 mg single doses probably produced useful pain relief. The small number of studies, and of people in them, meant that no sensible results about benefit or harm after taking the drug were available. 

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 3, 2009 on single dose oral dexibuprofen (S(+)-ibuprofen) for acute postoperative pain in adults.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched for randomised studies of dexibuprofen in acute postoperative pain in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (The Cochrane LIbrary), and for clinical trial reports and synopses of published and unpublished studies from Internet sources.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate intensity and consistent with events normally associated with anaesthesia and surgery. There were no serious adverse events or deaths.
<RES> Additional data did not alter the conclusions from the earlier review.

<H1> Written emotional disclosure for asthma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Stress may cause worsening of asthma. Previous studies showed that "written emotional disclosure," an activity that encourages people to write about stressful experiences, helps to reduce stress and improve well-being. Therefore written emotional disclosure may have a role in the management of asthma by reducing stress.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the medical literature to find out whether written emotional disclosure improves lung function and asthma symptoms in asthmatic patients. We looked at studies that compared the effectiveness of completing written emotional disclosure versus writing about topics unrelated to emotion.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Four studies, involving 414 participants, were included in this review. The trials lasted between two months and 12 months. One study was conducted in the UK, the other three in the USA. All studies compared emotional disclosure writing versus non-stressful writing. Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents. The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years. In all trials, most of the participants were female.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is no evidence to support that written emotional disclosure is helpful in improving lung function or symptoms in patients with asthma. However, disclosure may be beneficial for patients' perceptions of their own asthma control. Based on evidence obtained from the studies, we are not able to draw conclusions about the role of written emotional disclosure in quality of life, psychological well-being, asthma medication use or use of healthcare facilities for asthma-related problems. Better designed studies are necessary to determine the effects of written emotional disclosure for patients with asthma.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Our interpretation of the studies was limited by variation in study settings, topics of the non-stressful writing exercise and study duration. The evidence presented in this review is generally of low quality. This summary was current to January 2014.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> This review aims to determine the effectiveness of written emotional disclosure for people with asthma, specifically, to assess:


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: We conducted a review to determine whether NIV during exercise training affects exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV (placebo) in people with COPD.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: This review was generally limited by the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants within the included studies. The quality of the evidence was low for exercise capacity outcomes, largely because of issues with study design. Consequently, the effect of NIV during exercise training on exercise capacity is uncertain. The quality of the evidence for quality of life, training intensity and isoload blood lactate was moderate, and these findings can be interpreted with a greater degree of confidence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review focuses on the use of antibiotics to prevent clinical bacterial complications in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs.
<ABS> We included four trials (1314 children). Three trials investigated the prevention of ear infections and one investigated the prevention of pneumonia. Just one of the included trials addressed outcomes related to adverse effects caused by antibiotics in children with undifferentiated ARI. However, the trial's data could not be analysed as it was expressed in percentages rather than absolute terms.
<ABS> Our goal was to evaluate the benefits and harms of the use of antibiotics in preventing bacterial complications in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs. The quality of evidence currently available does not provide strong support for antibiotic use in preventing ear infections and pneumonia in children with undifferentiated ARIs.
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified four trials involving 1314 children. Three trials investigated the use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to prevent otitis and one investigated ampicillin to prevent pneumonia.
<RES> The use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo to prevent otitis showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.11, three trials, 414 selected children, moderate-quality evidence). Methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not clearly stated in two trials. Performance, detection and reporting bias could not be ruled out in three trials.
<RES> Harm outcomes could not be analysed as they were expressed only in percentages.
<RES> No studies were found assessing mastoiditis, quinsy, abscess, meningitis, hospital admission or death.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of paying for performance to improve the delivery of health care in low- and middle-income countries. After searching for all relevant studies, they found nine studies that met their requirements. The findings of this review are summarised below.

<H1> Exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background - what is OA of the hip and what is exercise?
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain):
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain to be 8 points lower (4 to 11 points lower) at end of treatment (8% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain as 21 points.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their pain as 29 points.
<ABS> Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower score means better physical function):
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function to be 7 points lower (1 to 12 points lower) at end of treatment (7% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function as 22 points.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their physical function as 29 points.
<ABS> Quality of life (higher score means better quality of life):
<ABS> - Overall, people with hip OA participating in the studies had a similar quality of life compared with the general population (normative scores of average 50 points), and quality of life was not further improved by participation in an exercise programme: 0 points higher.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale.
<ABS> Withdrawals
<ABS> - three more people out of 100 dropped out of the exercise programme (1% absolute increase).
<ABS> - Six out of 100 people in exercise programmes dropped out.
<ABS> - Three out of 100 people who did not exercise dropped out.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects such as injuries or falls during exercise, but we would expect these to be rare, and no injuries were reported in the studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during general anaesthesia in adult patients 16 years of age and older.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PEEP is a mechanical technique that is often used for ventilating an unconscious patient. The technique involves adding a quantity of pressure into the lungs at the end of each breath. This process causes a degree of deflation in the lungs and can collapse some areas because between breaths, the lungs contain less air than usual. By adding positive pressure at that time, we aim to reinflate the collapsed areas of the lung (atelectasis). Although PEEP can be used during general anaesthesia, some lung areas collapse at the end of the anaesthetic procedure. We do not know whether patients who receive PEEP have lower risks of postoperative mortality (approximately 3% to 5% of adult patients) or respiratory complications. In this review, we aimed to assess the postoperative benefits and harms of using PEEP during general anaesthesia.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to October 2013. We found 10 randomized clinical trials involving 432 participants. The main limitation of our review was our inability to identify studies analysing intraoperative data.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Six trials reported mortality. We pooled these data and found no differences between the group of patients who received PEEP and those who did not, but because of the small number of patients, and the fact that this outcome may be rare, these results did not allow us to make a conclusion about the effect of PEEP on mortality. Two results suggested some benefit of PEEP. First, oxygenation was better on the day after surgery in the PEEP group. Second, radiological imaging showed less atelectasis after surgery in the PEEP group. The studies that we found did not suggest that intraoperative PEEP causes harm.
<ABS> Because of the small number of studies, this finding is inconclusive. We performed calculations to predict how many more participants would be needed before reliable conclusions can be made about the effect on mortality of the application of PEEP. This number was 21,200.
<ABS> Evidence is currently insufficient to allow conclusions about how intraoperative PEEP affects postoperative mortality and respiratory complications.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is very low because of poorly conducted studies, small numbers of participants and low event rates.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About half a million children are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) every year, usually infecting the lungs, but also other organs of the body, and can cause meningitis. Infection in children is relatively common, and so establishing effective drug regimens that are easy to take and monitor is important.
<ABS> TB drug regimens are standardised globally, and include a combination of drugs given daily for six months. More than 95% of children are cured with this treatment. Giving anti-TB drugs twice- or thrice-weekly is more convenient to supervise than daily treatment but may not be as effective as daily treatment in curing children of TB. The World Health Organization currently recommends only daily treatments, but some national governments recommend twice- or thrice-weekly doses for children with TB.
<ABS> In this Cochrane review, the review authors compared children given intermittent anti-TB treatment to those given daily treatment. They examined the evidence up to 30 May 2013 and included four randomized trials that compared twice-weekly treatment with daily doses of anti-TB drugs, but none evaluated thrice-weekly dosing. The four trials included 563 children aged five months to 15 years, not known to be resistant to TB drugs. The trials were published over 12 years ago and the regimens used are not those currently recommended.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In comparisons of twice-weekly versus daily anti-TB treatment regimens, the trials did not detect differences in the number of patients cured, but trials were small, and the comparator regimens were not standard (four trials, 465 children; very low quality evidence). Trials were underpowered to provide estimates for death (two trials, 213 participants, very low quality evidence), relapse (one trial, 214 participants, very low quality evidence), and treatment limiting adverse events (four trials, 441 participants, very low quality evidence)
<RES> Reported adherence to treatment was similar (87% versus 84%; four trials, 458 children, very low quality evidence)
<RES> We did not find trials comparing the commonly used thrice-weekly anti-TB short-course regimen with the daily treatment regimen.

<H1> The effects of singing on lung function and quality of life in children and adults with cystic fibrosis

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Date of latest search: 31 March 2014.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> What are the effects of dietary interventions or physical activity interventions, or both, based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) stages of change (SOC) to produce sustainable (one year and longer) weight loss in overweight and obese adults?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Generally, weight loss programmes tend to involve diet and physical activity interventions. The TTM describes a series of five SOC an individual goes through when changing from an unhealthy behaviour to a healthy one. In this review, we assessed the use of the TTM SOC in weight management programmes for overweight and obese adults especially in terms of the effects on weight loss, dietary habits, physical activity and behaviour changes.
<ABS> Obesity (body mass index of at least 30 kg/m²) and overweight (body mass index of 25 to less than 30 kg/m²) are increasingly being recognised as important public health issues. Together, they contribute to serious health problems and extensive economic costs worldwide. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat and is defined as the individual's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m²). The BMI should be considered as a rough guide only because it is mainly used for whole populations and may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals (like for athletes and physically non-active individuals).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included three studies in our systematic review. Altogether the studies evaluated 2971 participants, with 1467 participants allocated to the intervention groups and 1504 to the control groups. The studies had a length of intervention of 9, 12 and 24 months.
<ABS> This plain language summary was current as of December 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The use of the TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies provided inconclusive evidence about the impact of such interventions on sustainable weight loss (mean difference in favour of the TTM SOC was between 2.1 kg and 0.2 kg at 24 months). However, other positive effects were noted, such as changes in physical activity and dietary habits that included increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. The studies did not report other important outcomes such as health-related quality of life, illness (morbidity) and economic costs.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low. The main limitations included incomplete reporting of outcomes, methodological shortcomings, extensive use of self-reported measures and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to the lack of long-term assessments.


<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We did not use measured outcomes as criteria for study selection.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (i.e. corticosteroids) given by mouth or injection (i.e. systemically) compared to placebo or standard clinical care on acute attacks of nose and sinus complaints (i.e. acute sinusitis) in children and adults.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Acute sinusitis may be caused directly by viral or bacterial infections and by the body's inflammatory response to these infections. Therefore, anti-inflammatory treatments may be effective in treating this condition. Earlier reviews found only modest beneficial effects of corticosteroids given by nasal spray. It is unclear if this is because the intranasal corticosteroids did not actually reach the (blocked) nasal passages or because anti-inflammatory drugs do not work.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review included evidence up to 19 February 2014. Five trials involving 1193 participants aged 15 years and older with acute sinusitis were included. In four trials participants received either antibiotics plus oral corticosteroids or antibiotics plus control treatment, while one trial assessed the effects of corticosteroids alone. Information on symptom relief was only available for the short term (two weeks or less) and no trial reported on relapse rates. No data for children were available.
<ABS> Key outcomes
<ABS> After combining trial findings, the results suggest that adults treated with oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics are more likely to have short-term symptom relief than those receiving a placebo or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug plus antibiotics. To benefit a single person, seven would need to receive treatment (number needed to treat to benefit). The trial assessing the effects of oral corticosteroids without antibiotics found no beneficial effects compared to placebo. Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of the evidence for oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the estimate) as the evidence is derived from four trials, including a relatively low number of participants, with a substantial risk of bias. Evidence of the effect of oral corticosteroids without antibiotics is derived from only one high-quality trial and we therefore judged the quality to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five RCTs with a total of 1193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In four trials antibiotics were prescribed in addition to oral corticosteroids or control treatment, while one trial investigated the effects of oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Medications for high blood pressure in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hypertension (high blood pressure) is known to increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure. The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising. A significant proportion of children with hypertension require medication to reduce blood pressure and medication use has increased significantly over the past several years. 

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 21 trials evaluated antihypertensive medications of various drug classes in 3454 hypertensive children with periods of follow-up ranging from three to 24 weeks. There were five RCTs comparing an antihypertensive drug directly with placebo, 12 dose-finding trials, two trials comparing calcium channel blockers with angiotensin receptor blockers, one trial comparing a centrally acting alpha blocker with a diuretic and one trial comparing an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker. No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage. The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies.

<H1> Medical treatment for botulism

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Medical treatment for botulism

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed evidence on the effect of medical treatment on human botulism.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Botulism is a serious illness that starts suddenly and causes paralysis (an inability to use muscles). A germ called Clostridium botulinum is the cause. If left untreated, a lot of people who have botulism die. There are four main types, adult and infant types where the intestine (gut) is infected; botulism from contaminated food; and wound botulism. We assessed the evidence on the effect of medical treatment on human botulism.
<ABS> We searched for clinical trials of medicines for any of the four major types of botulism. We decided to assess the effects of treatment on the rate of deaths in hospital from any cause within four weeks. We were also interested in deaths within 12 weeks, length of hospital stay, the need for a ventilator to help with breathing (mechanical ventilation), feeding by tube, and harmful events.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Once we had searched the medical literature and checked the results, we found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT), which was in infant botulism. The treatment was a single dose of a medicine made from human immune proteins (human-derived botulinum immune globulin or BIG). In the trial, 59 participants received BIG and 63 received an inactive treatment.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in the trial. Infants treated with BIG were in hospital for three weeks less, on average, and spent a shorter time on a ventilator. The average length of tube feeding in the BIG group was over six weeks less than in the control group. The risk of harmful effects was no greater with BIG than with the inactive treatment. The evidence was of high quality overall (moderate for time spent on a ventilator).
<ABS> The review shows that there is evidence for the use of BIG to treat infant botulism. On the other hand, there is no evidence for or against botulism antitoxin or other medical treatments.
<ABS> The evidence was up to date to March 2013, when we updated the searches and found no new trials.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have an increased mortality and morbidity compared to the general population. T2D is characterised by several metabolic defects including impaired insulin secretion and action, causing chronic hyperglycaemia (high glucose levels in the blood). Chronic hyperglycaemia is strongly associated with increased risk of kidney, eye, and nerve complications (microvascular complications) as well as increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and amputations (macrovascular complications). Epidemiological studies suggest that reducing blood glucose in people with T2D may reduce the risk of death and morbidity. However, such studies do not represent a reliable methodology to assess the effects of interventions because of the inherent risk of imbalances (which may be hidden and therefore uncorrectable) between groups, other than those resulting from the interventions. It is still not clear whether targeting more intensive glycaemic control is better than conventional glycaemic control in terms of clinical outcomes based on evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs).
<ABS> In this updated Cochrane systematic review, we identified 28 RCTs comparing intensive glycaemic control versus conventional glycaemic control in participants with T2D. A total of 18,717 participants randomised to intensive glycaemic control and 16,195 to conventional glycaemic control were included in the analyses. The trials were primarily conducted in Europe and Northern America. The mean duration of the intervention period varied from three days to 12.5 years. Only two trials were considered to have low risk of bias; we may, therefore, have evaluated RCTs with high risk of overestimating beneficial effects and underestimating harmful effects.
<ABS> Our analyses did not show any statistically significant reduction in either death from any cause or death from heart disease when targeting intensive glycaemic control compared with conventional control. Intensive glycaemic control seemed to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, amputation of a lower extremity, and microvascular complications while increasing the risk of severe adverse events and hypoglycaemia. Targeting intensive glycaemic control did not appear to change the risk of non-fatal stroke, cardiac revascularization (a procedure to reconstruct damaged heart blood vessels), and peripheral revascularization. Health-related quality of life did not differ significantly when comparing targeting intensive with conventional glycaemic control.
<ABS> There is a need for more powerful RCTs with low risk of bias to guide the choice of targeting intensive versus conventional glycaemic control in patients with T2D.

<H1> Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for chronic pain

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Stimulating the brain without surgery in the management of chronic pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Various devices are available that can electrically stimulate the brain without the need for surgery or any invasive treatment in order to manage chronic pain. There are four main treatment types: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in which the brain is stimulated by a coil applied to the scalp, cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in which electrodes are clipped to the ears or applied to the scalp, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and reduced impedance non-invasive cortical electrostimulation (RINCE) in which electrodes are applied to the scalp. These have been used to try to reduce pain by aiming to alter the activity of the brain, but the efficacy of these treatments is uncertain.
<ABS> This review update included 56 studies: 30 of rTMS, 11 of CES, 14 of tDCS and one of RINCE. We judged only three studies as having a low risk of bias. Low or very low-quality evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS and rTMS applied to pre-frontal areas of the brain are not effective but that a single dose of high-frequency stimulation of the motor cortex area of the brain provides short-term pain relief. This effect appears to be small and may be exaggerated by a number of sources of bias. Studies that gave a course of multiple treatments of rTMS produced conflicting results with no overall effect seen when we pooled the results of these studies. Most studies of rTMS are small and there is substantial variation between studies in terms of the treatment methods used. Low-quality evidence does not suggest that CES or tDCS are effective treatments for chronic pain. A single small study of RINCE provided very low-quality evidence of a short-term effect on pain. For all forms of stimulation the evidence is not conclusive and uncertainty remains.
<ABS> The reporting of side effects varied across the studies. Of the studies that clearly reported side effects, short-lived and minor side effects such as headache, nausea and skin irritation were usually reported both after real and sham stimulation. There were two reports of seizure following real rTMS.
<ABS> While the broad conclusions for rTMS and CES have not changed substantially, the addition of this new evidence and the application of the GRADE system has modified some of our interpretation. Previous readers should re-read this update.
<ABS> More studies of rigorous design and adequate size are required to evaluate accurately all forms of non-invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in chronic pain.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included an additional 23 trials (involving 773 participants randomised) in this update, making a total of 56 trials in the review (involving 1710 participants randomised). This update included a total of 30 rTMS studies, 11 CES, 14 tDCS and one study of RINCE(the original review included 19 rTMS, eight CES and six tDCS studies). We judged only three studies as being at low risk of bias across all criteria.
<RES> Meta-analysis of studies of rTMS (involving 528 participants) demonstrated significant heterogeneity. Pre-specified subgroup analyses suggest that low-frequency stimulation is ineffective (low-quality evidence) and that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is ineffective (very low-quality evidence). We found a short-term effect on pain of active high-frequency stimulation of the motor cortex in single-dose studies (low-quality evidence, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.27 to -0.51 P < 0.01)). This equates to a 12% (95% CI 8% to 15%) reduction in pain, which does not exceed the pre-established criteria for a minimal clinically important difference (≥ 15%). Evidence for multiple-dose studies was heterogenous but did not demonstrate a significant effect (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> For CES (six studies, 270 participants) no statistically significant difference was found between active stimulation and sham (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Analysis of tDCS studies (11 studies, 193 people) demonstrated significant heterogeneity and did not find a significant difference between active and sham stimulation (very low-quality evidence). Pre-specified subgroup analysis of tDCS applied to the motor cortex (n = 183) did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect and this lack of effect was consistent for subgroups of single or multiple-dose studies.
<RES> One small study (n = 91) at unclear risk of bias suggested a positive effect of RINCE over sham stimulation on pain (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Non-invasive brain stimulation appears to be frequently associated with minor and transient side effects, though there were two reported incidences of seizure related to active rTMS in the included studies.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Regular painkillers in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Laparoscopic surgery is associated with less pain than open surgery for removal of the gallbladder but postoperative pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of painkillers may be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The different types of painkillers include those that decrease the inflammation (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDS), which include drugs that are available over-the-counter such as paracetamol and ibuprofen and other drugs that are not available over-the-counter such as diclofenac; opium-like painkillers such as codeine and morphine, and some painkillers that are used to treat fits but also possess the ability to decrease the pain such as gabapentin and pregabalin. The last two classes of drugs are available only as prescription drugs except for low dose codeine in some countries. The benefits and harms of giving painkillers on a regular basis in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown. We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials for benefits (where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) and comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms. We compared the regular use of painkillers with no regular use of painkillers (ie, painkillers were administered as and when required) and the different type of painkillers.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 25 randomised clinical trials involving 2505 people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The choice of whether the participants received the different painkillers (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in people who were as similar as possible. The treatments in all the included trials were aimed at decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy before the participants reported pain. Participants were allowed to take additional painkillers as required in most of the trials.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in three trials (183 participants) that reported deaths. The differences in the serious complications between the groups was imprecise in all the comparisons. None of the trials reported quality of life or the time taken to return to normal activity. The differences in length of hospital stay and the time taken to return to work was imprecise in all the comparisons that reported these. Pain was lower in the participants who received painkillers compared with those who received controls at 4 to 8 hours and at 9 to 24 hours as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10). This is a modest reduction and is comparable to other methods of pain reduction such as administering local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) during the operation. In summary, different painkillers reduce pain scores in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the decision to use these drugs has to weigh the clinically small reduction in pain against uncertain evidence of serious adverse events associated with many of these agents.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary. Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the benefits and harms of different analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endoscopic release for carpal tunnel syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about how safe and effective endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) is, compared to any other type of surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> CTS is the most common cause of nerve compression in the arm. The carpal tunnel is the space between a ligament that stretches across the wrist and the bones below. In CTS there is increased pressure on a nerve (the median nerve) as it passes over the wrist towards the palm of the hand through the carpal tunnel. To release the pressure on the nerve in the carpal tunnel, surgeons cut the ligament. This operation can be done as traditional ‘open’ surgery (OCTR), or through an endoscope (ECTR), using a small camera with one or two small cuts in the skin.
<ABS> We searched widely for trials that compared ECTR with other types of surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found 28 studies, involving 2586 people, that were suitable for the review. We considered results at less than three months and more than three months after surgery.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> With support from low quality evidence only, OCTR and ECTR are about as effective as each other in relieving symptoms and improving hand function in CTS. ECTR probably has lower rates of minor complications (such as scar pain and infections) than OCTR but similar rates of major complications. ECTR also allows a faster return to work or daily activities. However, limitations in the studies in this review limit the quality of this evidence.
<ABS> Only one study declared a conflict of interest and nine studies clearly reported no conflict of interest. Four studies were funded from an academic source. Evaluation following the GRADE assessment reveals a low to moderate quality of evidence for the outcomes provided.
<ABS> The evidence in the review is current to November 2012. We re-ran the search shortly before publication and we will fully assess three further studies from this search when the review is updated.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-eight studies (2586 hands) were included. Twenty-three studies compared ECTR to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR), five studies compared ECTR with OCTR using a modified incision, and two studies used a three-arm design to compare ECTR, standard OCTR and modified OCTR.
<RES> At short-term follow-up (three months or less), only one study provided data for overall improvement. We found no differences on the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.21) or on the Functional Status Scale (FSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.14) within three months postoperatively between ECTR and OCTR. Pain scores favoured ECTR over conventional OCTR (two studies, SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.18). No difference was found between ECTR and OCTR (standard and modified) when pain was assessed on non-continuous dichotomous scales (five studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.45). Also, no difference was found in numbness (five studies, RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.71). Grip strength was increased after ECTR when compared with OCTR (six studies, SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of 4 kg (95% CI 1 to 6.9 kg) when compared with OCTR, which is probably not clinically significant.
<RES> In the long term (more than three months postoperatively) there was no significant difference in overall improvement between ECTR and OCTR (four studies, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14). SSS and FSS were also similar in both treatment groups (two studies, MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.22 for SSS and MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.16 for FSS). ECTR and OCTR did not differ in the long term in pain (six studies, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.38) or in numbness (four studies, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.35). Results from grip strength testing favoured ECTR (two studies, SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.71), corresponding to an MD of 11 kg (95% CI 6.2 to 18.81). Participants treated with ECTR returned to work or daily activities eight days earlier than participants treated with OCTR (four studies, MD -8.10 days, 95% CI -14.28 to -1.92 days).
<RES> Both treatments were equally safe with only a few reports of major complications (mainly with complex regional pain syndrome) (15 studies, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.64).
<RES> ECTR resulted in a significantly lower rate of minor complications (18 studies, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81), corresponding to a 45% relative drop in the probability of complications (95% CI 62% to 19%). ECTR more frequently resulted in transient nerve problems (ie, neurapraxia, numbness, and paraesthesiae), while OCTR had more wound problems (ie, infection, hypertrophic scarring, and scar tenderness). ECTR was safer than OCTR when the total number of complications were assessed (20 studies, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 90) representing a relative drop in the probability by 40% (95% CI 60% to 10%).
<RES> Rates of recurrence of symptoms and the need for repeated surgery were comparable between ECTR and OCTR groups.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in studies that contribute data to these results is rather high; fewer than 25% of the included studies had adequate allocation concealment, generation of allocation sequence or blinding of the outcome assessor.
<RES> The quality of evidence in this review may be considered as generally low. Five of the studies were presented only as abstracts, with insufficient information to judge their risk of bias. In selection bias, attrition bias or other bias (baseline differences and financial conflict of interest) we could not reach a safe judgement regarding a high or low risk of bias. Blinding of participants is impossible due to the nature of interventions.
<RES> We identified three further potentially eligible studies upon updating searches just prior to publication. These compared ECTR with OCTR (two studies) or mini-open carpal tunnel release (one study) and will be fully assessed when we update the review.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of water-based exercise (but not swimming) training in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus no exercise or a different kind of exercise in terms of exercise capacity and quality of life.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence contributing to these results was generally low to moderate. This was mainly a result of poor study design and not enough data.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five studies were included with a total of 176 participants (71 people participated in water-based exercise training and 54 in land-based exercise training; 51 completed no exercise training). All studies compared supervised water-based exercise training versus land-based exercise training and/or no exercise training in people with COPD (with average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) %predicted ranging from 39% to 62%). Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 53 participants. The exercise training programmes lasted from four to 12 weeks, and the mean age of participants ranged from 57 to 73 years. A moderate risk of bias was due to lack of reporting of randomisation, allocation and blinding procedures in some studies, as well as small sample sizes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with mental health problems often have complex and long-term difficulties with their physical health such as weight gain, smoking and heart problems. They sometimes do not take care of themselves, have inactive lifestyles and may not be able to cope with daily life or work. People with mental health problems have higher rates of diabetes, lung disease, cancer, heart problems, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases.
<ABS> Physical health care monitoring can take a variety of forms from simple checks carried out by the person themselves to complex specific health checks carried out by health professionals. Monitoring helps identify current health problems and also anticipate future health problems.
<ABS> In August 2006 the United Kingdom’s Department of Health issued guidance on how to provide better care for the physical health needs of people with serious mental illness. Spearhead Trusts, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and other organisations all promoted the use of physical health care monitoring for people with mental health problems.

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation for improving automobile driving after stroke

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Driving rehabilitation for stroke

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> After stroke, many people have limitations in their driving ability because of problems with movement, seeing and responding to hazards. Two approaches to treatment have been used. The first approach involves retraining the underlying skills of movement, thinking and sensing. The second approach involves using driving simulators and on-road driving practice in the form of lessons, which aim to improve the driver's skills.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified four studies, up to October 2013, which involved 245 people after stroke. A wide range of interventions was used, including driving simulation, training on devices to improve speed of processing information, scanning and movement. All studies compared the effectiveness of the driving intervention on improving whether drivers passed or failed on a driving assessment.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no evidence that a driving intervention was more effective than no intervention. One trial found that training on a driving simulator resulted in improved performance on a test of recognising road signs immediately after training.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Results should be interpreted with caution, as this was a single study. Further trials involving large numbers of participants, grouped according to their impairments and stroke type are required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are orthodontic appliances in moving the upper teeth backwards in children and adolescents.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current as of December 2012. In this review there are 10 studies published between 2005 and 2011 in which a total of 354 children were randomised to receive treatment with a distalising orthodontic appliance and compared to either no treatment, headgear or another distalising appliance. The age range of children in nine of the studies was from 11 to 15 years, although the children recruited to one study were younger, from nine to 10 years old. Both girls and boys participated in the studies.
<ABS> Where it was mentioned, the funding was from a university or dental research foundation. The authors did not assess the impact of the funding sources.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When intraoral appliances are compared to headgear they will probably move the upper molar teeth backwards more than headgear. However, the use of intraoral appliances was also associated with movement of the upper front teeth when compared to extraoral appliances in four studies. This is an unwanted effect that was not observed with the use of the headgear appliances.
<ABS> Harm, injury from the appliances and other characteristics of the appliances which may be important to patients were not reported in the studies.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is generally of low quality. The main shortcomings were related to trial design.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies, reporting data from 354 participants, were included in this review, the majority of which were carried out in a university dental hospital setting. The studies were published between 2005 and 2011 and were conducted in Europe and in Brazil. The age range of participants was from nine to 15 years, with an even distribution of males and females in seven of the studies, and a slight predominance of female patients in three of the studies. The quality of the studies was generally poor; seven studies were at an overall high risk of bias, three studies were at an unclear risk of bias, and we judged no study to be at low risk of bias.
<RES> No included studies reported on the incidence of adverse effects (harm, injury), number of attendances or rate of non-compliance.


<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded (July 2013).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The planned analysis of quality of life, return to work, and number of hospital admissions was impossible to complete as the outcome data for the analysis were not available from any trials.

<H1> Endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We compared the benefits and harms of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and endothelial keratoplasty (EK) in people with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) to determine whether one is more effective or safer than the other.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The innermost layer (endothelial cell layer) of the cornea (transparent front of the eye) is essential for maintaining corneal transparency by pumping fluid out and preventing swelling, which leads to opacification. FED is a disease caused by premature degeneration of the endothelial cells leading to fluid in the cornea (oedema), blisters on the surface of the eye (bullous keratopathy) and blurred vision. Severe cases can be treated by corneal transplants, which can be broadly classified into the two types of procedures of PKP (the central cornea is replaced using full thickness corneal tissue from a deceased donor) and EK (where only the innermost layer of the cornea is transplanted).
<ABS> The EK procedure can be performed using several methods such as deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK), Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) or femtosecond laser-assisted endothelial keratoplasty (FLEK).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found three randomised controlled trials that compared EK with PKP, one of which used the FLEK method. The evidence was current to January 2014. The three trials enrolled a total of 139 eyes of 136 participants, of which 123 eyes were included in the final analyses. The trial on FLEK and PKP was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in the Netherlands; the other two trials were conducted in the United States and were reported in 2008 and 2009 but the study dates were not specified. Over 70% of the included participants were diagnosed with FED, and the remaining participants had other ocular conditions.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between the two groups in one study at 12 months and another at 24 months. Chances of having an irregular shape of the front of the cornea (astigmatism) was less but endothelial cell loss was higher following EK procedures than after PKP. Only one trial reported harms of the interventions, and indicated that FLEK may result in slightly more complications than PKP (for example, 8% graft failure in the FLEK group versus none in the PKP group; and 3% graft rejection in the FLEK group versus 2% in the PKP group). No trials reported information about quality of life or economic data.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was not high due to some limitations with the study designs and because all trials had small numbers of participants with FED.


<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The secondary objectives were to determine the incidence of untoward effects of SSC and to compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen studies (n = 1594 infants) were included. Fifteen studies (n = 744) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), two used intramuscular injection, and one used 'vaccination' (n = 80). The studies that were included were generally strong and free from bias.
<RES> Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control. Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared mother versus other provider on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference. When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis. One study compared SSC with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more effective than dextrose alone. Similarly, in another study SSC was more effective than oral glucose for heart rate but not oxygen saturation. SSC either in combination with breastfeeding or alone was favoured over a no-treatment control, but was not different to breastfeeding. There were not enough participants with similar outcomes and painful procedures to compare age groups or duration of SSC. No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.

<H1> Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Excess body weight has become a problem around the world. Being overweight or obese may affect how well some birth control methods work to prevent pregnancy.  Hormonal birth control includes birth control pills, the skin patch, the vaginal ring, implants, and injectables. We looked at studies of hormonal birth control for women who were overweight or obese compared to women of normal weight or body mass index (BMI). The formula for BMI is weight (kg) / height (m)2.
<ABS> Though January 2013, we did computer searches for studies of hormonal birth control among women who were overweight or obese. We wrote to researchers to find other studies we might have missed. All types of studies were considered.
<ABS> Studies from the 1990s used weight alone rather than BMI. Results were mixed. Two studies showed women weighing 70 kg or more had more pregnancies than those weighing less than 70 kg. They examined an early vaginal ring (never marketed) and a six-rod implant. Two implant studies showed the body weight groups to be similar for pregnancy.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Biofeedback for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Chronic constipation (inability to achieve satisfactory bowel emptying for a prolonged period with no apparent medical cause) can be an embarrassing and socially restricting problem. There are many possible causes, including an inability to relax the muscles which control bowel movements. ’Biofeedback’, where computer equipment or a rectal balloon is used to show people how to coordinate and use the muscles properly, is often recommended.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is P. vivax malaria and how do ACTs work?
<ABS> P. vivax is one of five species of the malaria parasite known to cause clinical illness. It is a common cause of malaria in Asia, South America and Oceania. Unlike P. falciparum (the commonest cause of malaria in Africa), P. vivax has a liver stage which is not treated by most common antimalarial drugs. This liver stage can become active and cause a relapse of clinical illness weeks or even years after the initial illness.
<ABS> The standard treatment for vivax malaria has been chloroquine to treat the clinical illness, and a 14-day course of primaquine to clear the liver stage. In some parts of Oceania the P. vivax parasite in now highly resistant to chloroquine, which makes this treatment ineffective.
<ABS> Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria worldwide. As the effectiveness of chloroquine for P. vivax declines, alternative therapies are needed. If ACTs are also effective against P. vivax they could become the standard treatment for all forms of malaria.
<ABS> Current ACT combinations do not contain drugs effective against the liver stage of P. vivax so primaquine would still be necessary to achieve complete cure.
<ABS> What the research says about the effect of using ACTs
<ABS> We examined the research published up to 28 March 2013.
<ABS> Compared to chloroquine
<ABS> People who are treated with an ACT are probably less likely to have another episode of P. vivax malaria during the next six to eight weeks than those treated with chloroquine (only dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, and artesunate-pyronaridine have been compared with chloroquine). It is not clear whether this advantage is still present when primaquine is given to achieve a complete cure.
<ABS> Compared to alternative ACTs
<ABS> People who are treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine are probably less likely to have another episode of P. vivax malaria during the next six weeks than those treated with alternative ACTs (only artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate plus amodiaquine have been compared). This advantage may be present even when additional primaquine is given to achieve a complete cure.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 14 trials, that enrolled 2592 participants, and were all conducted in Asia and Oceania between 2002 and 2011.
<RES> ACTs versus chloroquine
<RES> ACTs clear parasites from the peripheral blood quicker than chloroquine monotherapy (parasitaemia after 24 hours of treatment: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.50, four trials, 1652 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> In settings where chloroquine remains effective, ACTs are as effective as chloroquine at preventing recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.90, five trials, 1622 participants, high quality evidence). In four of these trials, recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 were very low following treatment with both chloroquine and ACTs. The fifth trial, from Thailand in 2011, found increased recurrent parasitaemias following treatment with chloroquine (9%), while they remained low following ACT (2%) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.66, one trial, 437 participants).
<RES> ACTs versus alternative ACTs
<RES> In high transmission settings, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is probably superior to artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate plus amodiaquine at preventing recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49, three trials, 334 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine may also have an improved post-treatment prophylactic effect lasting for up to six weeks, and this effect may be present even when primaquine is also given to achieve radical cure (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46, two trials, 179 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> The data available from low transmission settings is too limited to reliably assess the relative effectiveness of ACTs.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is the most studied ACT. It may provide a longer period of post-treatment prophylaxis than artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate plus amodiaquine. This effect may be clinically important in high transmission settings whether primaquine is also given or not.

<H1> Deep brain and cortical stimulation for epilepsy


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Alpha-blockers could be considered as first-line treatment for patients presenting with urinary stones.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In 7/32 studies patients and doctors were both blinded. In the other studies blinding was not described in the methods or no blinding had taken place. Two studies described incomplete data and only one study showed a relatively high number of patients who withdrew from the study. These factors limited the methodological strength of the evidence found.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In this review, we assessed studies that compared the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions versus the usual care that participants received. The evidence is current to October 2013. Nineteen studies, with a total of 3204 men at different stages of prostate cancer, were included. All but three of these studies were carried out in the United States. The review focused on the following outcomes: quality of life, self-efficacy, knowledge, uncertainty, distress and depression.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen studies comparing psychosocial interventions versus usual care in a total of 3204 men with prostate cancer were included in this review. All but three of these studies were conducted in the United States.
<RES> The results for uncertainty (916 participants, SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.26) and distress (916 participants, SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.15) at end of intervention were compatible with both benefit and harm based on very low-quality evidence. No clear evidence suggests that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in reducing uncertainty and distress between groups at six to eight and at 12 months post-intervention. Finally, no clear evidence of benefit is associated with psychosocial interventions for depression at end of intervention (434 participants, SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.15) based on very low-quality evidence. Individual-based interventions significantly reduced depression when compared with usual care groups. The results for depression at six and at 12 months post-intervention were compatible with benefit and harm.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in the included studies was unclear or high, primarily as the result of performance bias.
<RES> No data regarding stage of disease or treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were extractable for subgroup analysis. Only one study addressed adverse effects. High attrition could indicate that some participants may not have been comfortable with the interventions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people, the main feature is a painful headache. Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting.
<ABS> Both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the triptan class of drugs are used to treat migraine headaches. This review examined how well naproxen (an NSAID) and sumatriptan (a triptan) work when combined together. On 2 August 2013, we looked for clinical trials where sumatriptan plus naproxen was used to treat migraine headache. We found 12 good quality studies with about 9300 people.
<ABS> The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was useful for treating migraine in the studies we found. It was not a lot better than using sumatriptan alone, but it was much better than using naproxen alone.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen. No studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated.
<RES> Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than sumatriptan.

<H1> Anticonvulsants for alcohol dependence

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticonvulsants for alcohol dependence

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review looked at evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of anticonvulsants alone or in combination with another medication or a psychosocial intervention for the treatment of alcohol dependence.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications. Together with psychosocial interventions, different pharmacological interventions have been tested in trials and systematic reviews. In this review, we wanted to discover whether anticonvulsants are better than placebo or are better than other medications, psychosocial interventions or no intervention.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> In October 2013, we used electronic medical databases to find all published and unpublished medical trials that compared anticonvulsants with placebo or other interventions. We also used other sources, such as conference proceedings, likely to contain trials relevant to the review. To be included in the review, medical trials had to have a randomised design and had to include adult participants (older than 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
<ABS> We identified 25 medical trials involving a total of 2641 participants. 80% of participants in these trials were male; mean age was 44 years. Most studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo (17 studies), but some researchers compared anticonvulsants versus other medications (seven studies) or no medication (two studies). The mean duration of the trials was 17 weeks (range four to 52 weeks). Half of the trials took place in the USA, the other half in Spain, Brasil, Germany, Greece, Italy, India and Thailand. The anticonvulsant included in most of the trials was topiramate; other medications were gabapentin, valproate, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, carbamazepine, pregabalin and tiagabine. Included studies used 73 different rating instruments and differed in design, quality, characteristics of patients, tested medications, services provided and treatments delivered.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> In 17 studies versus placebo, anticonvulsants were shown to be more effective than placebo in terms of number of drinks per drinking day and average heavy drinking. However, we found no clear evidence that anticonvulsants led to more participants abstaining from alcohol, fewer participants drinking heavily or fewer participants leaving treatment (dropouts). In terms of safety issues, the rate of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was not lower or higher in participants treated with anticonvulsants than in those treated with placebo. Moreover, for two of 18 specific side effects (dizziness and paraesthesia), anticonvulsants were worse than placebo. Other major known side effects, such as those affecting cognitive functioning (attention, confusion, speech problems), were insufficiently explored by primary studies. For single medications, results were globally confirmed for topiramate and partially for gabapentin and valproate.
<ABS> In the five studies in which anticonvulsants were compared with naltrexone, a medication considered efficacious for the treatment of alcohol dependence, anticonvulsants were associated with a lower number of heavy drinking days, with a higher number of days before a severe relapse occurred and with a lower rate of patient withdrawal for medical reasons. However, anticonvulsants were not more or less effective than naltrexone in affecting the rate of participants who showed severe relapse, who were not drinking during the trial or who left treatment (dropouts).
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> In looking at primary outcomes (dropouts, abstinence from alcohol during the trial, number of drinks per drinking day, heavy drinking, rate of patient withdrawal for medical reasons), the quality of the included studies was considered moderate. However, moving to subgroup analysis, as in the case of single types of medications, as well as to comparisons versus other medications, the finding of the review is limited by the small number of available studies.
<ABS> Authors' conclusions
<ABS> At the current stage of research, evidence supporting the clinical use of anticonvulsants to treat alcohol dependence is insufficient. Results are conditioned by heterogeneity and by the low number and quality of studies comparing anticonvulsants versus other medications. The uncertainty associated with these results leaves to clinicians the need to balance the possible benefits/risks of treatment with anticonvulsants versus other medications as supported by evidence of efficacy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 25 studies were included in the review (2641 participants). Most participants were male, with an average age of 44 years. Anticonvulsants were compared with placebo (17 studies), other medications (seven studies) and no medication (two studies). The mean duration of the trials was 17 weeks (range four to 52 weeks). The studies took place in the USA, Europe, South America, India and Thailand. Variation was reported in the characteristics of the studies, including their design and the rating instruments used. For many key outcomes, the risk of bias associated with unclear or unconcealed allocation and lack of blinding affected the quality of the evidence.
<RES> Anticonvulsants versus naltrexone: No evidence of difference was shown in dropout rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06), severe relapse rates (four studies, 427 participants, RR 0.69, 95% Cl 0.44 to 1.07) and continuous abstinence rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 1.21, 95% Cl 0.99 to 1.49); anticonvulsants were associated with fewer heavy drinking days (three studies, 308 participants, MD -5.21, 95% Cl -8.58 to -1.83), more days to severe relapse (three studies, 244 participants, MD 11.88, 95% Cl 3.29 to 20.46) and lower withdrawal for medical reasons (three studies, 245 participants, RR 0.13, 95% Cl 0.03 to 0.58).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for rhabdomyolysis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening condition where damaged muscle tissue breaks down quickly, and products of damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream. Of these products, a protein called myoglobin is harmful to kidney health and can lead to acute kidney injury. There is some evidence to suggest that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis.
<ABS> We searched the literature published before 6 January 2014, and after assessment, included three small studies that involved 101 participants. Our analysis found that although CRRT showed limited advantages over conventional treatment to improve some aspects of kidney function and muscle tissue loss, we found no significant benefits in reducing risk of death.
<ABS> The small body of available evidence demonstrated poor methodological quality, and was insufficient to enable us to make any robust conclusions about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis. Larger and better designed studies would be needed to investigate if CRRT is beneficial for people with rhabdomyolysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the three included studies (101 participants), one evaluated continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis and two investigated continuous venovenous haemofiltration; all included conventional therapy as control.
<RES> Although CRRT was associated with improved serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; reduced duration of the oliguria phase; and was associated with reduced time in hospital, no significant differences were found in mortality rates compared with conventional therapy (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.37). The included studies did not report on long-term outcomes or prevention of AKI.
<RES> Overall, we found that study quality was suboptimal: blinding and randomisation allocation were not reported by any of the included studies, leading to the possibility of selection, performance and detection bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with serious mental illness tend to have poorer physical health than the general population with a greater risk of contracting diseases and often die at an early age. In schizophrenia, for example, life expectancy is reduced by about 10 years. People with mental health problems have higher rates of heart problems (cardiovascular disease), infectious diseases (including HIV and AIDS), diabetes, breathing and respiratory disease, and cancer.
<ABS> This review focuses specifically on studies of general physical health advice and excludes more targeted health interventions.
<ABS> Based on an electronic search carried out in 2012, this review now includes seven studies that randomised a total of 1113 people with serious mental illness. Six studies compared general physical health advice with standard care, one compared advice on healthy living with artistic techniques such as sketching and pottery. Information was of limited low or very low quality, there were a small number of participants and findings were ambiguous.
<ABS> There is some limited evidence that the provision of physical healthcare advice can improve health-related quality of life mentally but not physically. No studies returned results that suggest that physical healthcare advice has a powerful effect on physical healthcare behaviour or risk of ill health. More work is needed in this area. Only one adverse effect outcome was presented, death, but there were no differences between the treatment groups for this outcome.
<ABS> Funders and policy makers should be aware that there may be some benefit for physical health advice for people with serious mental illness. There is an increased demand for preventative health services that involve the provision of advice and which may also reduce costs to health services.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray from RETHINK.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We found two small studies that investigated effectiveness and safety of percussion (striking or tapping the body, usually using a device called a percussor), diuresis (therapy to increase urine flow), and inversion therapy (placing the patient at an inverted angle) for treating lower pole kidney stones.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> For both studies selection bias was unclear; there was high risk of bias for performance bias; and detection, attrition and reporting bias were low.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Broken bones (fractures) are a major cause of disability in adults. The time taken for a bone to heal (achieve "union") is an important factor in determining recovery after an injury. A minority of fractures fail to heal at all or their healing takes considerably longer than expected. This review set out to find out whether treatment with ultrasound, in a variety of forms, accelerates fracture healing and reduces complications associated with new (acute) fractures. A related intervention, shockwave therapy, was also examined. Typically, ultrasound treatment involves placing a special device in contact with the skin overlying the fracture site for around 20 minutes on a daily basis.
<ABS> This is an update of a review previously published in February 2012. We did a new literature search up till 2 June 2014 but did not find any new studies. There are 12 studies, involving 622 participants with 648 fractures, included in this review. In all the studies we included, participants were assigned randomly to one of two groups, one group receiving treatment by ultrasound and the other group receiving no treatment or sham treatment. Most participants had a recent complete fracture of a single bone. The participants of two trials had 110 incomplete or stress fractures that resulted from heavy exercise. Four trials tested the effects of ultrasound on healing of 203 upper limb fractures and the other trials, on 130 lower limb fractures. The most commonly investigated bone was the tibia (shin bone). Eleven trials tested low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and one trial with 59 fractures tested shockwave therapy.
<ABS> Few complications were reported in any of the studies and these were not related to the ultrasound or shockwave therapy.
<ABS> While a potential benefit of ultrasound for the treatment of acute fractures in adults cannot be ruled out, the currently available evidence from 12 quite different trials is insufficient to support the routine use of ultrasound in clinical practice. Future studies should measure return to full function and normal activity and should try to ensure all participants are followed up.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 studies, involving 622 participants with 648 fractures. Eight studies were randomised placebo-controlled trials, two were randomised controlled trials without placebo controls, one was a quasi-randomised placebo-controlled trial and one was a quasi-randomised controlled trial without placebo control. Eleven trials tested LIPUS and one trial tested ECSW. Four trials included participants with conservatively treated upper limb complete fractures and six trials included participants with lower limb complete fractures; these were surgically fixed in four trials. The remaining two trials reported results for conservatively treated tibial stress fractures.
<RES> 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included studies was hampered by the poor reporting of methods, frequently resulting in the risk of bias of individual domains being judged as ‘unclear’. Both quasi-randomised studies were at high risk of bias, including selection and attrition bias. Three studies were at low risk of selection bias relating to allocation concealment the majority of studies were at low risk of performance bias as they employed a form of intervention blinding.
<RES> Only limited data were available from three of only four studies reporting on functional outcome. One study of complete fractures found little evidence of a difference between the two groups in the time to return to work (mean difference (MD) 1.95 days favouring control, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.18 to 6.08; 101 participants). Pooled data from two studies found LIPUS did not significantly affect the time to return to training or duty in soldiers or midshipmen with stress fractures (MD -8.55 days, 95% CI -22.71 to 5.61; 93 participants).
<RES> We adopted a conservative strategy for data analysis that was more likely to underestimate than to overestimate a benefit of the intervention. After pooling results from eight studies (446 fractures), the data showed no statistically significant reduction in time to union of complete fractures treated with LIPUS (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.47, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.20). This result could include a clinically important benefit or harm, and should be seen in the context of the highly significant statistical heterogeneity (I² = 90%). This heterogeneity was not explained by the a priori subgroup analyses (upper limb versus lower limb fracture, smoking status). An additional subgroup analysis comparing conservatively and operatively treated fractures raised the possibility that LIPUS may be effective in reducing healing time in conservatively managed fractures, but the test for subgroup differences did not confirm a significant difference between the subgroups.
<RES> Pooled results from five of the eight trials (333 fractures) reporting proportion of delayed union or non-union showed no significant difference between LIPUS and control (10/168 versus 13/165; RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.28). Adverse effects directly associated with LIPUS and associated devices were found to be few and minor, and compliance with treatment was generally good. One study reporting on pain scores found no difference between groups at eight weeks (101 participants).
<RES> One quasi-randomised study found no significant difference in non-union at 12 months between internal fixation supplemented with ECSW and internal fixation alone (3/27 versus 6/30; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.01). There was a clinically small but statistically significant difference in the visual analogue scores for pain in favour of ECSW at three month follow-up (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.37). The only reported complication was infection, with no significant difference between the two groups.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Statins for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> When the described search method was used and the eligibility criteria of the search results were applied, 653 records were found. Only two of these were randomised clinical trials that were considered eligible for inclusion. We assessed both trials as trials with high risk of bias. One of the trials was a pilot trial in which 16 participants with biopsy-proven NASH were randomised to receive simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) once daily for 12 months. No statistically significant improvement in the aminotransferase level was seen in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group. Liver histology was not significantly affected by simvastatin.
<RES> No data for all-cause mortality and hepatic-related mortality were reported in the included trials.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics for treating cholera

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of antibiotics for treating people with cholera. After searching for relevant trials, they included 39 randomized controlled trials enrolling 4623 people with cholera.
<ABS> What is cholera and how might antibiotics work
<ABS> Cholera is a form of severe watery diarrhoea, which spreads from person to person through food and water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera is common in places with poor water and sanitation, and sometimes causes large epidemics with thousands of people falling ill.
<ABS> Cholera can cause severe dehydration and death, so the main treatment is to give fluids and salt either orally as oral rehydration salts, or by injection. By clearing the bacteria earlier than the patients own immune system, antibiotics could reduce the duration and severity of the illness, and reduce onward transmission to other people.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Antibiotic treatment shortened the duration of diarrhoea by about one and a half days (the normal duration is between three and four days), and reduced the total amount of diarrhoea fluid by half. Consequently, the need for rehydration fluids was also reduced by almost half.
<ABS> Antibiotic treatment also shortened the period of time where the patient remains contagious by reducing the duration of excretion of Vibrio cholerae in the diarrhoea.
<ABS> The benefits of antibiotics were seen in trials recruiting only people with severe dehydration, and in those recruiting people with mixed levels of dehydration.
<ABS> Tetracycline or azithromycin appear more effective than some of the other antibiotics tested, but the choice of which antibiotic to use will depend on local drug resistance.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-nine trials were included in this review with 4623 participants.
<RES> Antimicrobials versus placebo or no treatment
<RES> Overall, antimicrobial therapy shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea by about a day and a half compared to placebo or no treatment (MD -36.77 hours, 95% CI -43.51 to -30.03, 19 trials, 1013 participants, moderate quality evidence). Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50% (ROM 0.5, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.56, 18 trials, 1042 participants, moderate quality evidence) and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40% (ROM 0.60, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, 11 trials, 1201 participants, moderate quality evidence). The mean duration of fecal excretion of vibrios was reduced by almost three days (MD 2.74 days, 95% CI -3.07 to -2.40, 12 trials, 740 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity in the size of these benefits, probably due to differences in the antibiotic used, the trial methods (particularly effective randomization), and the timing of outcome assessment. The benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting only patients with severe dehydration and in those recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration.
<RES> Comparisons of antimicrobials
<RES> In head-to-head comparisons, there were no differences detected in diarrhoea duration or stool volume for tetracycline compared to doxycycline (three trials, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); or tetracycline compared to ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin (three trials, 259 participants, moderate quality evidence). In indirect comparisons with substantially more trials, tetracycline appeared to have larger benefits than doxycycline, norfloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the primary review outcomes.
<RES> Single dose azithromycin shortened the duration of diarrhoea by over a day compared to ciprofloxacin (MD -32.43, 95% CI -62.90 to -1.95, two trials, 375 participants, moderate quality evidence) and by half a day compared to erythromycin (MD -12.05, 95% CI -22.02 to -2.08, two trials, 179 participants, moderate quality evidence). It was not compared with tetracycline.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We did not identify any randomised trials to help inform women and their doctors about which antithyroid drugs are most effective, with the lowest potential for harm.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No trials were included in the review.

<H1> Chinese herbal medicine for atopic eczema

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Atopic eczema (eczema in short) is a common skin condition, where skin changes occur and cause redness, scaling, swelling, and skin thickening due to chronic scratching. It is associated with loss of sleep, self-esteem, and quality of life. The frequency of eczema has increased over the past 10 years.
<ABS> A former Cochrane review published in 2004 found some evidence of a possible benefit of using oral Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for eczema; however, the results from only 4 included studies were inconclusive and need to be updated (those four studies have not been included in this update as they investigated a product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004). As well as updating that review, we have also widened the scope of the review to assess the effects of topical CHM for eczema. We wrote a new protocol to expand the scope of this review.
<ABS> This review included 28 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 2306 children and adults, of which 4 compared CHM to placebo, 22 to conventional medications, and 2 to CHM taken by mouth.
<ABS> Most of the included studies reported a higher number of participants who had recovered and significantly improved, with less itching in the CHM groups than the control groups. Where CHM was compared to conventional drugs, although the total effectiveness rate outcome was superior with CHM, it was based on very low quality evidence. One study reported that the quality of life (QoL) score in the CHM group was better than in the placebo group after using a CHM formula taken by mouth for 12 weeks. We assessed most of the studies as at high 'risk of bias' and therefore not of good quality, and there was substantial inconsistency between the studies, so any positive effect in CHM must be treated with caution.
<ABS> One study reported one severe adverse event. Minor adverse events were observed in 24 studies, including temporary elevation of enzymes in 3 cases, which was reversed soon after stopping CHM.
<ABS> Eight included studies received government funding.
<ABS> We could not find conclusive evidence that CHM taken by mouth or applied to the skin was of benefit to children or adults with eczema.
<ABS> Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for eczema.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of oral ingestion and topical applications of CHM for the management of eczema in children and adults.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 28 studies, with a total of 2306 participants. We assessed most of the studies at high 'risk of bias', particularly in blinding of participants and personnel, and there was substantial inconsistency between studies, so any positive effect of CHM must be treated with caution. We did not include the four studies from the previous version in this review, because they investigated a CHM product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004.
<RES> Four studies (three oral and one topical) compared CHM to placebo. Pooled data from 2 studies showed the total effectiveness rate in the CHM group was higher (by risk ratio (RR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 3.32; 2 studies; n = 85), and the itching visual analogue score (VAS) in the CHM group was 1.53 lower (by standardised mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 2.64 to 0.41; 2 Studies; n = 94) than the placebo group, where a lower VAS score indicates reduced itch. One study of 85 participants with moderate to severe eczema who received an oral CHM formula for 12 weeks reported a quality of life (QoL) score 2.5 lower in the CHM group (by difference in means (MD), 95% CI 4.77 to 0.23; 1 study; n = 85) than the placebo group, where a lower score indicates better QoL.  
<RES> Twenty-two studies and 1 arm from a study with a 4-arm parallel controlled design compared CHM (5 oral, 6 topical, and 12 mixed oral and topical) to conventional medicines. The total effectiveness rate in the CHM groups was superior (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.61; 21 studies; n = 1868; very low quality evidence), and the itching VAS in the CHM groups was 0.83 lower (SMD, 95% CI 1.43 to 0.22; 7 studies; n = 465) than the comparators.
<RES> Two studies compared combined oral and topical CHM to the same oral CHM formula alone. The total effectiveness rate in 1 study was not statistically significant (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.63; 1 study; n = 20). In the other study, the itching VAS in the CHM group was 1.05 lower (MD, 95% CI 1.75 to 0.35; 1 study; n = 23) than the control group.
<RES> With regard to side-effects, four studies did not give any report of adverse events. The other 24 studies reported minor adverse events, which were reversed soon after stopping CHM. One participant withdrew from one trial because of exacerbation of their condition after using the CHM intervention.
<RES> Eight studies received government funding.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for managing eczema.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure patients. We included seven small randomised controlled trials in this review, that were at a risk of bias. Due to the variation in the way that the studies were done we were not able to combine many of the data in our review, meaning that it is difficult to explore the impact of this variation on the results of this review. Only one study reported on mortality, majro cardiovascular evetns and hospitalisation. The evidence collected in this review shows no clear effect of coenzyme Q10 on the improvement of clinical status (using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification) or on exercise capacity. There is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included seven studies with 914 participants comparing conenzyme Q10 versus placebo. There were no data on clinical events from published randomised trials. The included studies had small sample sizes. Meta-analysis was only possible for a few physiological measures and there was substantial heterogeneity.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In this review, we assessed the efficacy and acceptability of behavioural therapies compared with all other psychological therapies in the treatment of acute phase depression (neither long-term nor treatment-resistant depression) in adults. Twenty-five randomised controlled trails were included in this review. The quality of evidence in our review is low because of issues with the design of the studies that we found and lack of precision in our results. Although we found that behavioural therapies and all other psychological therapies are equally effective and acceptable, more research is needed to confirm this finding.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1. To examine the effects of all BT approaches compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> When compared with integrative therapies and humanistic therapies, only one study was included in each comparison, and the analysis showed no significant difference between behavioural therapies and integrative or humanistic therapies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is a very common condition, in which people experience persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death. Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression. Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including behavioural, cognitive-behavioural (CBT), 'third wave' CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1. To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stress urinary incontinence (leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on coughing, sneezing or laughing) is a common condition that affects up to one in three women worldwide. It is usually the result of weakening of the muscular support of the pipe that conducts urine (urethra), or weakening of the sphincter (circular) muscle at the base of the bladder, which maintains continence. It is more common in women who have had children by vaginal delivery and in those who have weakness in the pelvic floor muscles for other reasons.
<ABS> Historically many types of surgery have been performed to treat women with stress urinary incontinence. Over the past 10 years, the accepted standard technique has been the mid-urethral sling operation, whereby an artificial tape or mesh is placed directly beneath the urethra and is anchored to the tissues in adjacent parts of the groin or just above the pubic bone. Examples of such slings that are commonly used are tension-free vaginal tape (TVTTM) and transobturator tape (TOT). These operations are usually quite successful, with success rates approaching 80% or 90%. However, they have been shown to result in significant side effects, which can be bothersome and sometimes even dangerous, such as damage to the bladder caused by tape insertion, erosion of the tape into the urethra during the healing period or chronic thigh/groin pain.
<ABS> In an effort to maintain efficacy while eliminating some of the side effects, a new generation of slings has been developed, called 'single-incision slings' or 'mini-slings'; these slings are the subject of this review. They are designed to be shorter (in length) than standard mid-urethral slings and do not penetrate the tissues as deeply as standard slings. It was therefore thought that they would cause fewer side effects while being no less effective. Examples of single-incision slings include TVT-Secur, MiniArc, Ajust and Needleless slings, among others.
<ABS> We looked for all trials that allocated participants at random to single-incision slings versus any other treatment for stress incontinence in women, especially comparisons with mid-urethral slings. We identified a total of 31 trials, involving 3290 women, all of which compared a type of single-incision sling versus a type of mid-urethral sling, or different types of single-incision slings against each other. Overall the quality of the trials was moderate.
<ABS> We found that subtle differences in the way individual mini-slings work have sometimes made comparisons difficult. TVT-Secur is a specific type of mini-sling that has consistently been shown to provide poorer control of incontinence, along with higher rates of side effects, compared with standard mid-urethral slings. It has already been withdrawn from clinical use.
<ABS> As most trials currently available for inclusion in this review assess TVT-Secur, trials comparing other single-incision slings versus standard mid-urethral slings were too few to allow meaningful comparisons. Some evidence suggests that single-incision slings were quicker to perform and may cause less postoperative pain, but more trials are needed to adequately assess whether the other types of mini-slings are in fact as good as or safer than standard mid-urethral slings.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 31 trials involving 3290 women. Some methodological flaws were observed in some trials; a summary of these is given in the 'Risk of bias in included studies' section.
<RES> No studies compared single-incision slings versus no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, laparoscopic procedures or traditional sub-urethral slings. Also no data on the comparison of single-incision slings versus retropubic mid-urethral slings (top-down approach) were available, but the review authors believe this did not affect the overall comparison versus retropubic mid-urethral slings.
<RES> The types of single-incision slings included in this review were TVT-Secur (Gynecare), MiniArc (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA), Ajust (C.R. Bard, Inc.,Covington, GA, USA), Needleless (Mayumana Healthcare, Lisse, The Netherlands), Ophira (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina), Tissue Fixation System (TFS PTY Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and CureMesh (D.Med. Co., Inc., Seoul, Korea).
<RES> Women were more likely to remain incontinent after surgery with single-incision slings than with retropubic slings such as tension-free vaginal tape (TVTTM) (121/292, 41% vs 72/281, 26%; risk ratio (RR) 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 4.14). Duration of the operation was slightly shorter for single-incision slings but with higher risk of de novo urgency (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.56). Four of five studies in the comparison included TVT-Secur as the single-incision sling.
<RES> Single-incision slings resulted in higher incontinence rates compared with inside-out transobturator slings (30% vs 11%; RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.36). The adverse event profile was significantly worse, specifically consisting of higher risks of vaginal mesh exposure (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 9.86), bladder/urethral erosion (RR 17.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 298.88) and operative blood loss (mean difference 18.79, 95% CI 3.70 to 33.88). Postoperative pain was less common with single-incision slings (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43), and rates of long-term pain or discomfort were marginally lower, but the clinical significance of these differences is questionable. Most of these findings were derived from the trials involving TVT-Secur: Excluding the other trials showed that high risk of incontinence was principally associated with use of this device (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.98 to 3.54). It has been withdrawn from clinical use.
<RES> Evidence was insufficient to reveal a difference in incontinence rates with other single-incision slings compared with inside-out or outside-in transobturator slings. Duration of the operation was marginally shorter for single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings, but only by approximately two minutes and with significant heterogeneity in the comparison. Risks of postoperative and long-term groin/thigh pain were slightly lower with single-incision slings, but overall evidence was insufficient to suggest a significant difference in the adverse event profile for single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings. Evidence was also insufficient to permit a meaningful sensitivity analysis of the other single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings, as all confidence intervals were wide. The only significant differences were observed in rates of postoperative and long-term pain, and in duration of the operation, which marginally favoured single-incision slings.
<RES> Overall results show that TVT-Secur is considerably inferior to retropubic and inside-out transobturator slings, but additional evidence is required to allow any reasonable comparison of other single-incision slings versus transobturator slings.
<RES> When one single-incision sling was compared with another, evidence was insufficient to suggest a significant difference between any of the slings in any of the comparisons made.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are fixed braces or removable retainers for managing relapse of lower front teeth after orthodontic treatment, compared to each other or no treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The most commonly used fixed retainers are:
<ABS> • normal braces that have brackets attached to the lips-side of teeth (labial braces);• braces with brackets attached to the tongue-side of teeth (lingual braces); or• a fixed flexible wire attached to the tongue-side of teeth without using brackets.
<ABS> The most common removable retainers are:
<ABS> • retainers made from wire and acrylic (Hawley’s retainer), with or without the addition of springs to apply force; or• clear 'invisible' aligners, free from metal brackets and wires, which are computer-generated to fit over the patient's lower teeth and move teeth in order.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group and the evidence is current up to 9 November 2012.
<ABS> In this review there are no trials published between 1950 and 2012 in which patients were randomly treated with either fixed braces, removable retainers or no treatment.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Currently there is no evidence to support using one form of treatment for managing relapse over another.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder are also called repetitive strain injury or occupational overuse syndrome. They are a burden for individual workers, for their employers and for society at large because they impair functioning both in daily life and at work.
<ABS> Studies included in the review
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We found 44 studies that included 6,580 persons. Twenty-one studies evaluated exercises, 13 evaluated ergonomic workplace adjustments and nine behavioural interventions. We combined the results of these studies per category. Eight other studies evaluated various other treatments.
<ABS> We did not find a consistent effect of any treatment on pain, recovery, disability or sick leave. Ergonomic interventions reduced pain in the long term but not in the short term in several studies. We judged nine studies to be of high quality, but the results were very inconsistent. We found no reason for the variation in study results. Better studies are needed that are bigger, have a clearer diagnosis of work-relatedness and comply with reporting guidelines.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 44 studies (62 publications) with 6,580 participants that evaluated 25 different interventions. We categorised these interventions according to their working mechanisms into exercises, ergonomics, behavioural and other interventions.
<RES> Overall, we judged 35 studies as having a high risk of bias mainly because of an unknown randomisation procedure, lack of a concealed allocation procedure, unblinded trial participants or lack of an intention-to-treat analysis.
<RES> We found very low-quality evidence indicating that ergonomic interventions did not lead to a decrease in pain when compared with no intervention at short-term follow-up (three studies, SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.22) but did decrease pain at long-term follow-up (four studies, SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.16). There was no effect on disability but sick leave decreased in two studies (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76). None of the ergonomic interventions was more beneficial for any outcome measures when compared with another treatment or with no treatment or with placebo.
<RES> Behavioural interventions had inconsistent effects on pain and disability, with some subgroups showing benefit and others showing no significant improvement when compared with no treatment, minor intervention controls or other behavioural interventions.
<RES> In the eight studies that evaluated various other interventions, there was no evidence of a clear beneficial effect of any of the interventions provided.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Studies are needed that include more participants, that are clear about the diagnosis of work-relatedness and that report findings according to current guidelines.

<H1> Information provision for people with multiple sclerosis


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In this review, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different follow-up approaches after first treatment for cervical cancer. We aimed to compare follow-up that is medical or nurse-led and is set down in a written procedure versus follow-up that is medical or nurse-led but responsive to the needs of women rather than being written in a procedure and delivered at pre-set times. We also wished to compare these types of follow-up versus follow-up initiated by the patient.  


<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in 14 studies using CSF Aß42. Of the 1349 participants included in the meta-analysis, 436 developed Alzheimer’s dementia. Individual study estimates of sensitivity were between 36% and 100% while the specificities were between 29% and 91%. Because of the variation in assay thresholds, we did not estimate summary sensitivity and specificity. However, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary ROC curve. At the median specificity of 64%, the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 72 to 87). This equated to a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 2.22 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.47) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR–) of 0.31 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.48).
<RES> The accuracy of CSF Aß42 for all forms of dementia was evaluated in four studies. Of the 464 participants examined, 188 developed a form of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia).The thresholds used were between 209 mg/ml and 512 ng/ml. The sensitivities were between 56% and 75% while the specificities were between 47% and 76%. At the median specificity of 75%, the sensitivity was estimated to be 63% (95% CI 22 to 91) from the meta-analytic model. This equated to a LR+ of 2.51 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.86) and a LR– of 0.50 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.51).
<RES> The accuracy of CSF Aß42 for non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in three studies. Of the 385 participants examined, 61 developed non-Alzheimer's disease dementia. Since there were very few studies and considerable variation between studies, the results were not meta-analysed. The sensitivities were between 8% and 63% while the specificities were between 35% and 67%.
<RES> Only one study examined the accuracy of plasma Aß42 and the plasma Aß42/Aß40 ratio for Alzheimer's disease dementia. The sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 81 to 90) was the same for both tests while the specificities were 50% (95% CI 44 to 55) and 70% (95% CI 64 to 75) for plasma Aß42 and the plasma Aß42/Aß40 ratio respectively. Of the 565 participants examined, 245 developed Alzheimer’s dementia and 87 non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. The accuracy of Aß42 for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia did not differ significantly (P = 0.8) between studies that pre-specified the threshold for determining test positivity (n = 6) and those that only determined the threshold at follow-up (n = 8). One study excluded a sample of MCI non-Alzheimer's disease dementia converters from their analysis. In sensitivity analyses, the exclusion of this study had no impact on our findings. The exclusion of eight studies (950 patients) that were considered at high (n = 3) or unclear (n = 5) risk of bias for the patient selection domain also made no difference to our findings.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The 'Theory of Mind' model suggests that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a profound difficulty understanding the minds of other people, their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and thoughts. It has been proposed that this may underlie many of the other difficulties experienced by people with ASD, including social and communication problems, and some challenging behaviours. Therefore, a number of studies have attempted to teach theory of mind and related skills to people with ASD.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review aimed to explore whether a) it is possible to teach theory of mind skills to people with autism and b) whether or not this evidence supports the theory of mind model. Having a 'theory of mind' may depend on developing related basic skills, including joint attention (sharing a focus of interest with another person), recognising other people's emotions from faces or stories, and imitating other people. Therefore, we included intervention studies that taught not just theory of mind itself, but also related skills.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found 22 research studies involving 695 participants, which reported on the efficacy of interventions related to theory of mind. The evidence is current to 7th August 2013.
<ABS> Key results and the quality of the evidence

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-two randomised trials were included in the review (N = 695). Studies were highly variable in their country of origin, sample size, participant age, intervention delivery type, and outcome measures. Risk of bias was variable across categories. There were very few studies for which there was adequate blinding of participants and personnel, and some were also judged at high risk of bias in blinding of outcome assessors. There was also evidence of some bias in sequence generation and allocation concealment. Not all studies reported data that fell within the pre-defined primary outcome categories for the review, instead many studies reported measures which were intervention-specific (e.g. emotion recognition). The wide range of measures used within each outcome category and the mixed results from these measures introduced further complexity when interpreting results.
<RES> Studies were grouped into four main categories according to intervention target/primary outcome measure. These were: emotion recognition studies, joint attention and social communication studies, imitation studies, and studies teaching ToM itself. Within the first two of these categories, a sub-set of studies were deemed suitable for meta-analysis for a limited number of key outcomes.
<RES> There was very low quality evidence of a positive effect on measures of communication based on individual results from three studies. There was low quality evidence from 11 studies reporting mixed results of interventions on measures of social interaction, very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of general communication, and very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of ToM ability.  
<RES> The meta-analysis results we were able to generate showed that interventions targeting emotion recognition across age groups and working with people within the average range of intellectual ability had a positive effect on the target skill, measured by a test using photographs of faces (mean increase of 0.75 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.29 points, Z = 2.75, P < 0.006, four studies, N = 105). Therapist-led joint attention interventions can promote production of more joint attention behaviours within adult-child interaction (mean increase of 0.55 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99 points, Z = 2.45, P value = 0.01, two studies, N = 88). Further analysis undermines this conclusion somewhat by demonstrating that there was no clear evidence that intervention can have an effect on joint attention initiations as measured using a standardised assessment tool (mean increase of 0.23 points, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.94 points, Z = 0.63, P value = 0.53, three studies, N = 92). No adverse effects were apparent.

<H1> Non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Cochrane authors considered the evidence for effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatrments for managing chronic pelvic pain in women.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic pelvic pain in women is a common problem. Specific causes are often difficult to identify, even after investigation with ultrasound and inspection of the pelvis with key hole surgery. Treatment is frequently limited to relief of symptoms obtained with a concoction of medicines. Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Twenty-one randomised controlled studies were identified, of which 13 were included. Eight studies were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 women in the control groups. The interventions assessed included medical treatment and psychological, cognitive, behavioural, complementary and physical therapies. The evidence is current to February 2014.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review concludes that evidence shows improvement of pain in women given a high dose of progestogen (50 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) immediately post-treatment and for up to nine months after treatment. However, progestogen was associated with adverse effects such as weight gain and bloating. Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and who received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those whose treatment involved a 'wait and see' policy. Some evidence of benefit was seen with writing disclosure therapy and with distension of painful pelvic structures. No good evidence of benefit was noted with other interventions when compared with standard care or placebo.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was low or moderate for most comparisons, and in most cases evidence was derived from single small studies. Moreover, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions on quality of life and physical and functional outcomes because of the large variation in outcome measures used by the included studies. Many interventions identified in this review involved only single studies with small sample sizes. Additional studies will be required in the future to replicate results obtained with the use of specific medical interventions.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-one RCTs were identified that involved non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded. The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups. Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures.
<RES> Medical treatment versus placebo
<RES> Head-to-head comparisons of medical treatments
<RES> Head-to-head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate-quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen. Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.94, n = 40, low-quality evidence). Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline. The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects.
<RES> Psychological treatment
<RES> Complementary therapy
<RES> Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate-quality evidence). No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low-quality evidence). Studies did not report on adverse effects.
<RES> The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Heart transplantation is sometimes possible for people with failing hearts who otherwise would die. Immunosuppressive treatment is necessary after heart transplantation to prevent rejection of the transplanted heart, and has two phases. The first phase is induction treatment, which is given at the time of transplantation, and only for a very short period. The second phase is maintenance treatment, which often starts at the time of the operation, but is given for much longer - often for life.
<ABS> Antibodies are molecules that combat specific targets. Antibodies against T-cells (a type of white blood cell) - known as T-cell antibodies - are used as a form of induction treatment in the first two weeks after heart transplantation. Different types of antibodies are used, but the benefits and harms of each type is unclear.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of T-cell antibodies in people who had had a heart transplant. We hoped to establish whether there is a role for antibodies against T-cells after heart transplantation, and, if so, which antibody preparation works best and causes the least harm. We found 22 studies that included 1427 people who had received a heart-transplant. Most of the trial participants received T-cell antibodies only in the first two weeks after surgery, but treatment for some continued for 10 weeks.
<ABS> All these trials had high risk of bias (that is risk of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms). We compared any kind of T-cell antibody induction versus no induction. Furthermore, we compared interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus no induction, monoclonal T-cell antibody versus no induction, interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) induction, interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus polyclonal antibody induction, and monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) induction versus polyclonal antibody induction. We found no significant differences in incidence of survival, and we found no significant difference in adverse effects (e.g. infection, cytomegalovirus infection, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, cancer, chronic allograft vasculopathy, renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension) for any of the comparisons. The incidence of acute rejection may occur less frequently in patients treated with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction compared with no induction , and in patients treated with polyclonal antibody induction compared with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction. However, systematic errors and random errors cannot be excluded, and our findings were dependent upon choice of statistical model. Accordingly, our observations are not robust and more trials are needed to confirm or reject these findings.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We observed some occasional significant differences in adverse events in some of the comparisons, however definitions of adverse events varied between trials, and numbers of participants and events in these outcomes were too small to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this review important?
<ABS> Major depression is a serious illness that can cause significant distress both to sufferers and their families. Major depression affects people's work, relationships and self-esteem. It also affects people physically, changing their sleep patterns, concentration and appetite. The symptoms of major depression can lead people to feel hopeless and even suicidal. Antidepressant medications are an effective treatment option for major depression, but many have unpleasant side-effects. 
<ABS> This review is important because it compares a new antidepressant, called agomelatine, with some other antidepressants used to treat major depression. Agomelatine works in a different way to existing antidepressants, it affects the hormone melatonin in the brain, and stimulates release of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.
<ABS> Who may be interested in this review?
<ABS> People affected by major depression.
<ABS> General Practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists and pharmacists.
<ABS> Professionals working in adult mental health services.
<ABS> Families and friends of people who suffer from major depression.
<ABS> What questions does this review aim to answer?
<ABS> Does agomelatine work better than other antidepressant medications?
<ABS> Do patients tolerate agomelatine better than other antidepressants?
<ABS> How do the side-effects of agomelatine compare with other antidepressants?
<ABS> Which studies were included in the review?
<ABS> In July 2013, we used electronic medical databases to find all published and unpublished medical trials that compared agomelatine with any other antidepressant. We also contacted Servier Laboratories (the developers of agomelatine) for additional information. To be included in the review, medical trials had to have a randomised design (i.e. be randomised controlled trials), and have adult participants (aged over 18) with a diagnosis of major depression.
<ABS> We identified 13 medical trials, involving a total of 4495 participants, that could be included in the review. The reviewers rated the overall quality of the trials as 'moderate'. Almost all of the trials included were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that developed agomelatine (Servier), which could introduce bias (research shows that funding strongly affects the outcomes of research studies).
<ABS> What does the evidence from the review tell us?
<ABS> The review included trials comparing agomelatine with a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and one antidepressant from the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor group, called venlafaxine. Participants in the studies were followed up for between six to 12 weeks.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was no more or less effective in reducing symptoms of depression than any of the other antidepressants.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was no more or less effective in preventing relapse of depression than any of the other antidepressants.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was tolerated better than venlafaxine (fewer people discontinued treatment), but the same as the SSRIs.
<ABS> - Agomelatine caused a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine.
<ABS> - Agomelatine caused a lower rate of vomiting, nausea and sexual side-effects than SSRIs.
<ABS> What should happen next?
<ABS> The reviewers conclude that agomelatine is not more effective than other antidepressants currently on the market. It did seem to be more tolerable to patients in terms of lower rates of some side-effects, however, the quality of trials was low and there were only a few trials that compared agomelatine with each medication. No firm conclusion on agomelatine can be made because of problems with reporting of data in the trials included. The authors recommend that further trials of agomelatine versus placebo (dummy pill), particularly in primary care settings (where the majority of patient/practitioner contact take place, e.g. GP surgeries), should be carried out to improve the quality of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies. There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies. The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings. With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise. Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial. Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good. Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished. Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful.

<H1> Analgesia for forceps delivery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Analgesia for forceps delivery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Forceps are instruments designed to aid in the delivery of the baby by gripping the head. Many different types of forceps have been developed. Forceps may be used when the baby fails to progress to delivery or to help to shorten labour for the mother when there is a need, for example when the mother is exhausted in the second stage of labour, if there is suspected distress of the fetus, or when the mother has a medical condition such as a cardiac, respiratory or neurologic condition that may prevent her from pushing. A woman who requires forceps to be used to assist her baby's birth needs effective pain relief (analgesia) so that she can remain comfortable to help the doctor perform the procedure safely.
<ABS> This review found that there is not enough evidence from the four included randomised controlled trials, involving 388 women and their babies, to determine the most effective and safe analgesic agent or technique for women who are undergoing a forceps delivery. Three of the four trials compared diazepam with alternative agents (ketamine, vinydan-ether, or "other" anaesthesic agent) to provide general anaesthesia during forceps delivery. A number of different methods were used to measure pain relief and the results could not be combined. The data from one trial could not be included in the review. Women who received diazepam were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women who received vinydan-ether in one small trial. In another small trial, however, no difference in pain relief was shown when diazepam was compared with ketamine. In the trial that compared spinal analgesia with pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were more likely to report their pain relief as adequate and were less likely to report severe pain. None of the four trials reported on serious complications or death for the mother or baby.
<ABS> The included trials had a high or unclear risk of bias and were not of a high quality. Each of the four included trials was conducted prior to 1980 and assessed agents or methods that are not commonly used in clinical practice today. Therefore, more studies are needed to establish what drug, or technique, is most effective and safe in reducing pain for the mother. These studies should also assess safety for the baby.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear to high risk of bias overall. A variety of different agents for providing analgesia were assessed in the trials, and a number of different methods to measure pain relief were used, and thus results could not be combined in meta-analysis. Three trials compared diazepam with an alternative agent (ketamine; vinydan-ether; "other" anaesthesic agent) for the provision of general anaesthesia, and one trial compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block (in both groups lignocaine was administered).
<RES> In terms of secondary outcomes, women receiving diazepam compared with vinydan-ether, were significantly less likely to experience vomiting (RR 0.04; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.62; 101 women). No significant differences were seen for the few neonatal outcomes that were reported across any of the comparisons (including Agpar score of less than seven at five minutes and acidosis as defined by cord blood arterial pH less than 7.2).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People who receive transplanted lungs are at significant risk of organ rejection. To help reduce the risk of organ rejection, antibodies against T-cells (a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in immunity) are given to patients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Several types of antibodies have been used, but their benefits and harms are unclear.
<ABS> We evaluated the use of antibodies against T-cells following lung transplantation to find out whether this therapy was safe, beneficial or harmful, and which type of antibodies work best with fewest adverse effects.
<ABS> We analysed six studies that investigated the use of several different types of antibody therapies in 278 adult patients following lung transplantation. Flaws in study designs were found that indicated the studies were at risk of overestimating benefits and underestimating harms.
<ABS> Our analysis compared several types of antibodies, but with one exception - that antithymocyte globulin seemed to increase some adverse events - we found no significant differences in lung survival or rejection for any of the treatments. There was some uncertainty about this effect because the study was too small to be sure that observed benefits would apply to a larger population. We found no significant differences among therapies in terms of infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our review included six RCTs (representing a total of 278 adult lung transplant recipients) that assessed the use of T-cell antibody induction. Evaluation of the included studies found all to be at high risk of bias.
<RES> We conducted comparisons of polyclonal or monoclonal T-cell antibody induction versus no induction (3 studies, 140 participants); polyclonal T-cell antibody versus no induction (3 studies, 125 participants); interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL-2RA) versus no induction (1 study, 25 participants); polyclonal T-cell antibody versus muromonab-CD3 (1 study, 64 participants); and polyclonal T-cell antibody versus IL-2RA (3 studies, 100 participants). Overall we found no significant differences among interventions in terms of mortality, acute rejection, adverse effects, infection, pneumonia, cytomegalovirus infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer.
<RES> We found a significant outcome difference in one study that compared antithymocyte globulin versus muromonab-CD3 relating to adverse events (25/34 (74%) versus 12/30 (40%); RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.98). This suggested that antithymocyte globulin increased occurrence of adverse events. However, trial sequential analysis found that the required information size had not been reached, and the cumulative Z-curve did not cross the trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries.
<RES> None of the studies reported quality of life or kidney injury. Trial sequential analyses indicated that none of the meta-analyses achieved required information sizes and the cumulative Z-curves did not cross the trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries, nor reached the area of futility.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further RCTs are needed to perform robust assessment of the benefits and harms of T-cell antibody induction for lung transplant recipients. Future studies should be designed and conducted according to methodologies to reduce risks of systematic error (bias) and random error (play of chance).


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified 5504 studies, of which 5138 were excluded on the basis of title and/or abstract. The full-text screening of the remaining 366 articles resulted in the inclusion of 57 studies investigating the prevalence of and sometimes also risk factors for early and late renal adverse effects of treatment for childhood cancer. The 57 studies included at least 13,338 participants of interest for this study, of whom at least 6516 underwent renal function testing. The prevalence of renal adverse effects ranged from 0% to 84%. This variation may be due to diversity in included malignancies, prescribed treatments, reported outcome measurements and the methodological quality of available evidence.
<RES> Chronic kidney disease/renal insufficiency (as defined by the authors of the original studies) was reported in 10 of 57 studies. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ranged between 0.5% and 70.4% in the 10 studies and between 0.5% and 18.8% in the six studies that specifically investigated Wilms' tumour survivors treated with a unilateral nephrectomy.
<RES> A decreased (estimated) glomerular filtration rate was present in 0% to 50% of all assessed survivors (32/57 studies). Total body irradiation; concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin B or cyclosporin A; older age at treatment and longer interval from therapy to follow-up were significant risk factors reported in multivariate analyses. Proteinuria was present in 0% to 84% of all survivors (17/57 studies). No study performed multivariate analysis to assess risk factors for proteinuria.
<RES> Hypophosphataemia was assessed in seven studies. Reported prevalences ranged between 0% and 47.6%, but four of seven studies found a prevalence of 0%. No studies assessed risk factors for hypophosphataemia using multivariate analysis. The prevalence of impairment of tubular phosphate reabsorption was mostly higher (range 0% to 62.5%; 11/57 studies). Higher cumulative ifosfamide dose, concomitant cisplatin treatment, nephrectomy and longer follow-up duration were significant risk factors for impaired tubular phosphate reabsorption in multivariate analyses.
<RES> Treatment with cisplatin and carboplatin was associated with a significantly lower serum magnesium level in multivariate analysis, and the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia ranged between 0% and 37.5% in the eight studies investigating serum magnesium.
<RES> Hypertension was investigated in 24 of the 57 studies. Reported prevalences ranged from 0% to 18.2%. A higher body mass index was the only significant risk factor noted in more than one multivariate analysis. Other reported factors that significantly increased the risk of hypertension were use of total body irradiation, abdominal irradiation, acute kidney injury, unrelated or autologous stem cell donor type, growth hormone therapy and older age at screening. Previous infection with hepatitis C significantly decreased the risk of hypertension.
<RES> Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform any meta-analysis.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Health and education are strongly connected: healthy children achieve better results at school, which in turn are associated with improved health later in life. This relationship between health and education forms the basis of the World Health Organization's (WHO’s) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework, an approach to promoting health in schools that addresses the whole school environment. Although the HPS framework is used in many schools, we currently do not know if it is effective. This review aimed to assess whether the HPS framework can improve students’ health and well-being and their performance at school.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched 20 health, education, and social science databases, as well as trials registries and relevant websites, for cluster-randomised controlled trials of school-based interventions aiming to improve the health of young people aged four to 18 years. We only included trials of programmes that addressed all three points in the HPS framework: including health education in the curriculum; changing the school’s social or physical environment, or both; and involving students’ families or the local community, or both.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 67 trials, comprising 1345 schools and 98 districts, that fulfilled our criteria. These focused on a wide range of health topics, including physical activity, nutrition, substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and drugs), bullying, violence, mental health, sexual health, hand-washing, cycle-helmet use, sun protection, eating disorders, and oral health. For each study, two review authors independently extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of the study being biased. We grouped together studies according to the health topic(s) they focused on.
<ABS> We found that interventions using the HPS approach were able to reduce students’ body mass index (BMI), increase physical activity and fitness levels, improve fruit and vegetable consumption, decrease cigarette use, and reduce reports of being bullied. However, we found little evidence of an effect on BMI when age and gender were taken into account (zBMI), and no evidence of effectiveness on fat intake, alcohol and drug use, mental health, violence, and bullying others. We did not have enough data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the HPS approach for sexual health, hand-washing, cycle-helmet use, eating disorders, sun protection, oral health or academic outcomes. Few studies discussed whether the health promotion activities, or the collection of data relating to these, could have caused any harm to the students involved.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. We identified some problems with the way studies were conducted, which may have introduced bias, including many studies relying on students’ accounts of their own behaviours (rather than these being measured objectively) and high numbers of students dropping out of studies. These problems, and the small number of studies included in our analysis, limit our ability to draw clear conclusions about the effectiveness of the HPS framework in general.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Overall, we found some evidence to suggest the HPS approach can produce improvements in certain areas of health, but there are not enough data to draw conclusions about its effectiveness for others. We need more studies to find out if this approach can improve other aspects of health and how students perform at school.

<H1> Self-management education programmes for osteoarthritis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis:
<ABS> Self-management education programmes may not improve self-management skills, osteoarthritis symptoms, function, quality of life and dropout rates but may reduce pain modestly compared with attention control. Active and positive engagement in life was not reported.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes may slightly improve self-management skills, pain and function but may not improve active and positive engagement in life, osteoarthritis symptoms, quality of life and dropout rates compared with usual care.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes probably do not improve outcomes compared with provision of information alone or compared with other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture).
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what are self-management education programmes?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip, or the joints in your hands. The joint cartilage that lines the joint gradually thins, narrowing the joint space. In severe cases, no cartilage remains between the bones, and the bones rub together when the joint is moved, making the joint painful and sometimes unstable.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes are behavioural interventions designed to encourage people with chronic disease to take an active role in the management of their own condition. These programmes aim to improve outcomes for patients by supporting, not replacing, medical care. The content used to educate patients about their condition and to explain how they can best manage their symptoms varies between programmes.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who undergo self-management programmes:
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their self-management skills to be 0.4 points better (0.4 points worse to 1.2 points better) on a scale of 1 to 10 (higher score means better self-management) after 12 months (4% absolute improvement; 4% worse to 12% better).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their self-management skills as 6.2 points on a scale of 1 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their self-management skills as 5.8 points on a scale of 1 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their pain to be 0.8 points lower (0.3 to 0.14 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 10 (lower score means less pain) after 12 months (8% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their pain as 5 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their pain as 5.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their osteoarthritis symptoms to be 0.14 points lower (0.54 points lower to 0.26 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 10 (lower score means fewer symptoms) after 12 months (1% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their symptoms as 4.1 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their symptoms as 4.2 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their function to be 0.04 points lower (0.02 points lower to 0.10 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 3 (lower score means better function) after 12 months (4% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their function as 1.25 points on a scale of 0 to 3.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their function as 1.29 points on a scale of 0 to 3.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their quality of life to be 0.01 points lower (0.03 points lower to 0.01 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 1 (higher score means better quality of life) after 12 months (1% absolute worsening).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their quality of life as 0.56 points on a scale of 0 to 1.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their quality of life as 0.57 points on a scale of 0 to 1.
<ABS> One more person out of 100 dropped out of self-management programmes (1% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 13 out of 100 people who received a self-management programme dropped out.
<ABS> - 12 out of 100 people who received attention control dropped out.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Compared with usual care, moderate-quality evidence from 11 studies (up to 1,706 participants) indicates that self-management programmes probably provide small benefits up to 21 months, in terms of self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms and function, although these are of doubtful clinical importance, and no improvement in positive and active engagement in life or quality of life. Withdrawal rates were similar. Low to moderate quality evidence indicates no important differences in self-management , pain, symptoms, function, quality of life or withdrawal rates between self-management programmes and information alone or other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that self-management education programmes result in no or small benefits in people with osteoarthritis but are unlikely to cause harm.
<CON> Compared with attention control, these programmes probably do not improve self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms, function or quality of life, and have unknown effects on positive and active engagement in life. Compared with usual care, they may slightly improve self-management skills, pain, function and symptoms, although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance.


<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of brief school-based interventions for substance-using adolescents.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included.
<RES> Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured. There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women).
<RES> Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women). This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months. Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28).
<RES> Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Influenza vaccines in immunosuppressed adults with cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Adults with cancer are prone to serious complications from influenza, more than healthy adults. The influenza vaccine protects against influenza and its complications. However, its effectiveness among cancer patients is unclear, as the immune dysfunction that accompanies cancer and as a result of chemotherapy might lower immune response to the vaccine. Cancer patients, therefore, do not have clear information on the importance, need and safety of the vaccine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of introducing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing malaria in areas where diagnosis has traditionally been based on clinical symptoms alone. After searching for relevant trials, they included seven randomized controlled trials, which enrolled 17,505 people with fever.
<ABS> What are RDTs and how might they improve patient care
<ABS> RDTs are simple to use diagnostic kits which can detect the parasites that cause malaria from one drop of the patient's blood. They do not require laboratory facilities or extensive training, and can provide a simple positive or negative result within 20 minutes, making them suitable for use in rural areas of Africa where most malaria cases occur.
<ABS> Improving malaria diagnosis by introducing RDTs is unlikely to improve the health outcomes of people with true malaria as they would probably have received antimalarials even if the health worker was relying on clinical symptoms alone. However, for patients with fever not due to malaria, RDTs could improve health outcomes by prompting the health worker to look for and treat the true cause of their fever earlier.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> In these trials, diagnosis using RDTs had little or no effect on the number of people remaining unwell four to seven days after treatment (low quality evidence).
<ABS> However, using RDTs reduced the prescription of antimalarials by up to three-quarters (moderate quality evidence), and this reduction was highest where health workers only prescribed antimalarials following a positive test, and where malaria was less common.
<ABS> Using RDTs to support diagnosis did not have a consistent effect on the prescription of antibiotics, with some trials showing an increase in antibiotic prescription and some showing a decrease (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Use of RDTs did not result in more patients with malaria being incorrectly diagnosed as not having malaria and being sent home without treatment (low quality evidence).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included seven trials, enrolling 17,505 people with fever or reported history of fever in this review; two individually randomized trials and five cluster randomized trials. All trials were conducted in rural African settings.
<RES> In most trials the health workers diagnosing and treating malaria were nurses or clinical officers with less than one week of training in RDT supported diagnosis. Health worker prescribing adherence to RDT results was highly variable: the number of participants with a negative RDT result who received antimalarials ranged from 0% to 81%.
<RES> Overall, RDT supported diagnosis had little or no effect on the number of participants remaining unwell at four to seven days after treatment (6990 participants, five trials, low quality evidence); but using RDTs reduced prescribing of antimalarials by up to three-quarters (17,287 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence). As would be expected, the reduction in antimalarial prescriptions was highest where health workers adherence to the RDT result was high, and where the true prevalence of malaria was lower.
<RES> Using RDTs to support diagnosis did not have a consistent effect on the prescription of antibiotics, with some trials showing higher antibiotic prescribing and some showing lower prescribing in the RDT group (13,573 participants, five trials, very low quality evidence).
<RES> One trial reported malaria microscopy on all enrolled patients in an area of moderate endemicity, so we could compare the number of patients in the RDT and clinical diagnosis groups that actually had microscopy confirmed malaria infection but did not receive antimalarials. No difference was detected between the two diagnostic strategies (1280 participants, one trial, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Concentrating on improving the care of RDT negative patients could improve health outcomes in febrile children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effects of general anaesthesia (GA) for children having day surgery. The GA was given to the children either by intravenous injection (injection of a drug such as propofol or thiopental) or by the child inhaling or breathing a gas such as sevoflurane or halothane through a mask. We found 16 studies that compared these two types of GA.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> We wanted to find out whether intravenous or inhaled anaesthesia reduced the risk of outcomes such as postoperative nausea and sickness (vomiting) (PONV) and behavioural problems in children having day surgery. PONV is one of the most common problems for children having day surgery. PONV is a common reason for delay in a child's hospital discharge and for their unplanned admission to hospital. Postoperative pain can cause behavioural problems in children. These behavioural problems may present as moaning, being restless and confused, and physical movements such as thrashing about in the bed. Mental disturbances such as hallucinations, delusions and confusion can also be evident as a child emerges from GA.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> The evidence was current to 1 October 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 16 studies (900 participants) in this review. All participants were otherwise healthy children (aged under 15 years) who were scheduled for day surgery. The studies compared different types of intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic medications.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The authors found that when compared to inhaled anaesthesia with sevoflurane, intravenous anaesthesia with propofol may reduce the risk of PONV and the risk of behavioural problems with no difference in the time to recovery from anaesthesia and discharge from hospital in children having day surgery. The effect on complications was imprecise. The studies that compared other anaesthetic agents involved different types of surgical procedures, different procedure durations and drugs, making it difficult to sum the results.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials included in this review were of poor quality and had high risk of bias. There was great variety in the included studies in the combinations of drugs, duration of anaesthesia and types of surgical procedures, which made the results uncertain. Further trials are needed to compare the types of anaesthesia used in children's ambulatory surgery.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 16 trials that involved 900 children in this review. Half of all the studies did not describe the generation of randomized sequence and most studies did not describe adequate allocation sequence concealment. The included studies showed variability in the types and combinations of drugs and the duration of anaesthesia, limiting the meta-analysis and interpretation of the results.
<RES> For the maintenance of anaesthesia there was a significant difference favouring anaesthesia with propofol, with or without nitrous oxide (N2O), when compared to thiopentone and halothane + N2O (OR 3.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 7.02, four studies, 176 children, low quality evidence; and OR 7.44; 95% CI 2.60 to 21.26, two studies, 87 children, low quality evidence), respectively. For the time to discharge from the recovery room, there were no significant differences between groups. The studies were performed with different ambulatory surgeries and a high risk of bias.
<RES> Four studies (250 participants) compared the induction of anaesthesia by the inhalational or intravenous route, with inhalational anaesthesia for maintenance, and found no significant differences between groups in all outcomes (the risk of PONV, behavioural disturbances, respiratory and cardiovascular complications and time to discharge from recovery room). Meta-analysis was not done in this comparison because of significant clinical heterogeneity.
<RES> Readmission to hospital was not reported in any of the included studies. No other adverse effects were reported.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the accuracy of imaging tests to detect tears of the rotator cuff tendons in the shoulder.
<ABS> The rotator cuff is a group of tendons involved in the positioning and moving of the shoulder joint. The rotator cuff lets people lift their arm and reach overhead. In a lot of people, wear and tear of the rotator cuff tendons is a normal part of ageing and they may not have symptoms. However, many people will develop pain in their shoulder at some point as the tendons degenerate further and tears in the rotator cuff tendons develop. There may also be inflammation of the shoulder tendons or bursa (a sac with internal gliding surfaces that helps the shoulder to move). Often the pain is made worse by sleeping on the affected shoulder and moving the shoulder in certain directions. Often there will be pressure on the tendons by the overlying bone when lifting the arm up. This is called impingement. It may become difficult to use the shoulder in every day activities, sports or work.
<ABS> If the pain does not go away by itself or with treatments such as steroid injections or physiotherapy, surgery may be performed. Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and ultrasound (US) are used to assess the presence and size of rotator cuff tears to assist in the planning of the surgery.
<ABS> Rotator cuff tears can be classified as full or partial thickness tears based on the extent or size of the tears. No test is 100% accurate in identifying tears or assessing their size. The accuracy of the tests is commonly assessed by the sensitivity of the test (the proportion of people who had a tear according to the test, among patients with tears), and specificity (the proportion of people without tears on the test, among patients with no tears).
<ABS> We searched electronic databases up to February 2011, as well as trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles, for studies comparing diagnostic tests for people with suspected rotator cuff tears. Our review included 20 studies (1147 shoulders). Many studies had design flaws, which limited the reliability of their findings. We found that MRI, MRA and US may have similar accuracy for detecting the presence of full thickness tears. For identifying any tears (no distinction between partial or full thickness) or identifying partial thickness tears, MRI and US may also have similar accuracy. However, it appears that compared with US, MRI may be more sensitive in identifying partial thickness tears. With these results we can conclude that all three imaging tests (MRI, MRA and US) may help decisions regarding referral for surgery for people with suspected full thickness tears. Information on adverse effects of using these tests was not reported by the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 20 studies of people with suspected rotator cuff tears (1147 shoulders), of which six evaluated MRI and US (252 shoulders), or MRA and US (127 shoulders) in the same people. Many studies had design flaws, with the potential for bias, thus limiting the reliability of their findings. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was judged to be low or unclear. For each test, we observed considerable heterogeneity in study results, especially between studies that evaluated US for the detection of full thickness tears and studies that evaluated MRA for the detection of partial thickness tears. The criteria for a positive diagnostic test (index tests and reference standard) varied between studies.
<RES> Because few studies were direct head-to-head comparisons, we could not perform meta-analyses restricted to these studies. The test comparisons for each of the three classifications of the target condition were therefore based on indirect comparisons which may be prone to bias due to confounding.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones. Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year. Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones. More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy. Pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) into the tummy (abdomen) is considered to be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, the best method of administration of local anaesthetics is not known. The controversies include which drug to use, when to administer it, whether it should be administered in the form of liquid or in the form of misty spray, and to which part of the tummy it should be administered. We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials for assessment of benefit. When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment. We included comparative non-randomised studies for the assessment of treatment-related harms. Two authors searched the literature and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 12 randomised clinical trials involving 798 people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The trials compared different methods addressing the various controversies mentioned above. The choice of the method of administration of the local anaesthetic was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in participants who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths or serious complications in either group in the comparisons that reported these. None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work. The differences in hospital stay between the methods being compared was imprecise in all the comparisons that reported hospital stay. Although there were some differences in the pain scores on the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10 cm), these differences were neither consistent nor robust to different methods of statistical analysis. The evidence currently available is inadequate to determine the effects of one method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation compared with any other method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation in low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the study was conducted. The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary. Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing the procedure and the people who provide funds for the treatment.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> An acute ankle sprain is a sudden-onset injury of the ankle ligaments (tough strands of tissue that connect and stabilise the bones at the ankle). It is one of the most common injuries in the general population as well as in athletes. Acupuncture is frequently used for treating ankle sprains in eastern Asian countries. This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults. We searched the medical literature for studies up to May 2013.
<ABS> Our review includes 20 studies involving 2012 people with ankle sprains. These studies differed from each other in many ways and compared various types of acupuncture with a variety of standard control interventions. Most studies reported only the 'cure rate' - the number of participants who had recovered at a set time. No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function. Only one study reported on adverse events and found skin problems in individuals receiving over-the-counter traditional Chinese herbal patches as a control intervention. Most trials had flaws in the way they were conducted, which makes their results less reliable; for example, most studies failed to ensure participants did not know which intervention they were receiving.
<ABS> One study, which compared acupuncture with no treatment, found more people were cured with acupuncture. Most of the eight studies comparing acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone found higher cure rates in the acupuncture group. However, we found that pooling these results did not provide conclusive evidence that acupuncture resulted in a better cure rate.
<ABS> Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese herbal patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, Chinese oral herbal medicine and elastic bandages. Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test. The pooled results from 11 studies comparing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to favour acupuncture, but this evidence was not conclusive.
<ABS> Currently, we are unable to conclude whether or not acupuncture is more effective than other standard methods for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults because of the very low quality of the available evidence. Because the adverse effects of acupuncture treatment were not described in most of the studies, we are also unable to draw any conclusions about the safety of acupuncture. Large, high quality studies of acupuncture for sudden-onset ankle sprains in adults are needed.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included a total of 20 heterogeneous studies (2012 participants with acute ankle sprains); three of which included more than one comparison. Seventeen trials were conducted in China. All of the studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The results may also have been affected by selection bias, particularly as five studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and 12 studies gave no information on their method of randomisation. Of our three prespecified primary outcomes, only cure rate was reported by the majority of studies. No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function and only one reported on adverse events (in which three participants receiving a control intervention experienced skin problems from over-the-counter Chinese herbal patches). The other 19 studies did not record or report on adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence for cure rates as very low for all comparisons, which means we are very uncertain about the reliability of any of the estimates.
<RES> The single study comparing acupuncture treatment with no treatment found acupuncture to be more effective with regard to cure rate at five days (31/31 versus 1/30; RR 20.34, 95% CI 4.27 to 96.68). Acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone was tested in eight studies; with cure rate data available for seven. Most of these studies reported higher cure rates in the acupuncture plus another standard treatment group than in the standard treatment alone group. However, while the results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from eight trials testing acupuncture versus no acupuncture tended to favour acupuncture, the results were very inconsistent across the studies and the estimated effect was very imprecise (383/396 versus 272/355; RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84; P value = 0.1; I2 = 98%).
<RES> Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese drug patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, oral Chinese herbal medicine and elastic bandage. Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test. The results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from 11 trials testing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to slightly favour acupuncture, but these were not statistically significant and the data were very heterogeneous (404/509 versus 416/497; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22; P value = 0.30; I2 = 92%).

<H1> Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Postnatal depression is a common condition that affects women and may impact on their babies. Common symptoms of postnatal depression include fluctuations in mood, mood changes, suicidal ideation and preoccupation with infant well-being ranging from over-concern to frank delusions. There is currently not much evidence regarding interventions that might prevent or treat postnatal depression. A diet lacking in certain vitamins, minerals or other nutrients may cause postnatal depression in some women. Correcting this deficiency with dietary supplements might therefore prevent postnatal depression. Examples of possible dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include omega-3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s-adenosyl-L-methionine, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), B6 (pyridoxine), B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D and calcium.
<ABS> This review identified two randomised controlled studies. One study examined the effect of selenium supplements taken by women from the first trimester to birth in preventing postnatal depression. This study had a high risk of bias because of women withdrawing or not completing their self-scoring system for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). It may also have been difficult to ensure that the women took their supplements because of concerns that exist about taking supplements during pregnancy. More high-quality studies would be required to confirm any benefit in preventing postnatal depression using selenium.
<ABS> This review also identified one randomised controlled study that compared docosahexanoic and eicosapentaenoic acid to placebo in women at risk of postpartum depression. This study found that neither docosahexanoic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid prevented postpartum depression.
<ABS> Overall, there is not enough evidence at this stage to recommend selenium, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or any other dietary supplement for the prevention of postnatal depression. Unfortunately there were no other studies of other dietary supplements that met our selection criteria. Other dietary supplements need to be studied in trials where depressed women are excluded from entry to determine if supplements prevent postnatal depression.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two randomised controlled trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Two trials with a total of 2024 participants were included in this review. The trial published in 1983 in the USA included only adults, while the trial in 1998 in South Africa included only children. Both trials were set in large metropolitan cities. We were unable to combine the results of the two studies due to incomplete data. However, both trials came to the same conclusion regarding the use of chest X-rays in chest infections, except in the subgroup of patients with evidence of infection (infiltrates) on their X-rays. In both adults and children, chest X-rays did not result in significant differences in recovery time.
<ABS> In summary, there were no differences in patient outcomes between the groups with or without chest X-ray. Although both studies suggest that chest X-rays do not improve patient outcomes, it is not clear if this finding can be applied to all populations and settings. Results may be different in resource poor countries. Our conclusions are limited due to the lack of complete data available and by the risk of bias of the studies. Adverse effects of chest X-rays were not assessed by either study. We assessed the quality of the evidence from both trials as being moderate. For the remainder of this review, X-rays will be referred to as radiographs.
<ABS> The evidence is current as of February 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The study in adults also reports that chest radiographs did not affect the frequencies with which clinicians ordered return visits or antibiotics. However, there was a benefit of chest radiographs in a subgroup of the adult participants with an infiltrate on their radiograph, with a reduction in length of illness (16.2 days in the group allocated to chest radiographs and 22.6 in the non-chest radiograph group, P < 0.05), duration of cough (14.2 versus 21.3 days, P < 0.05) and duration of sputum production (8.5 versus 17.8 days, P < 0.05). The authors mention that this difference in outcome between the intervention and control group in this particular subgroup only was probably a result of "the higher proportion of patients treated with antibiotics when the radiograph was used in patient care".
<RES> Hospitalisation rates were only reported in the study involving children and it was found that a higher proportion of patients in the radiograph group (4.7%) required hospitalisation compared to the control group (2.3%) with the result not being statistically significant (P = 0.14). None of the trials report the effect on mortality, complications of infection or adverse events from chest radiographs. Overall, the included studies had a low or unclear risk for blinding, attrition bias and reporting bias, but a high risk of selection bias. Both trials had strict exclusion criteria which is important but may limit the clinical practicability of the results as participants may not reflect those presenting in clinical practice.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The selection bias assessment was low in four studies and unclear in two. Five studies were open-label; however the primary outcome (residual kidney function) was obtained objectively from laboratory tests, and were not likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding. Reporting bias was unclear in all six studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The primary objective of this review was to assess the positive and negative outcomes of tighter blood glucose control ('intensive' glucose control) compared to less intense treatment targets ('conventional' glucose control) in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Treatment of type 1 diabetes consists of life-long blood sugar control through insulin replacement. It is generally agreed that achieving 'good' blood sugar control while avoiding episodes of very low blood sugars (severe hypoglycaemia) should be the primary treatment goal for individuals with type 1 diabetes. However, clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 12 relevant studies, which included a total of 2230 participants. The participant populations varied widely across studies regarding age, disease duration, and existing diabetes complications. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all studies took place in Europe or North America.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that intensive glucose control was highly effective in reducing the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications, such as retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve disease). For developing retinopathy, 63 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 232 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing nephropathy, 159 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 284 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication. For developing nephropathy, 49 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 139 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication.
<ABS> A weaker effect was found on the progression of retinopathy, while we could not find clear evidence of benefit of tight blood sugar control on the progression of nephropathy once participants had developed microalbuminuria (the kidney leaking small amounts of the protein albumin into the urine); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy.
<ABS> Major macrovascular outcomes (such as stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely; therefore we could not draw firm conclusions from the studies included in this review.
<ABS> We found that intensive glucose control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, however the results varied across studies and only one big study showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. An analysis according to haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (a long-term measure of glucose control) at the start of the study suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia with intensive glucose control is possibly only increased for people who started the study with relatively low HbA1c values (less than 9.0%).
<ABS> There were very few data on health-related quality of life, death from any cause, and costs. Overall, mortality was very low in almost all studies. The effects of intensive glucose control on health-related quality of life were unclear and were consistent with benefit or harm. One study reported that intensive glucose control could be highly cost-effective when considering the potential reduction of diabetes complications in the future.
<ABS> Tight blood sugar control reduced the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The main benefits identified in this review came from studies in younger individuals who were at early stages of the disease. Appropriate patient training is important with these interventions in order to avoid the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications occur. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effects of tight blood sugar control on older patient populations or individuals with macrovascular disease. There is currently no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets, therefore treatment goals need to be individualised, taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as people's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> For the majority of outcomes we evaluated the overall quality of evidence as moderate or low (analysed by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system).
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of December 2012.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 12 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2230 patients. The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies. Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category.
<RES> Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P < 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P < 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P < 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence. Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence).
<RES> Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence).
<RES> We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (< 9.0%). Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Overall, all-cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Health-related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence). In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost-effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence).


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified. The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries. Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias. Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results. The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling. Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention-control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation for cognitive dysfunction in people with multiple sclerosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis' (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11).
<ABS> The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of cognitive (neuropsychological) rehabilitation in MS. We did this by considering the effects of rehabilitation on cognitive test performance and everyday cognitive performance, as well as on depression, fatigue, personality/behaviour disturbances, anxiety and quality of life.
<ABS> Twenty relevant studies comprising a total of 986 participants (966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) were identified and included in this review. Low-level evidence was found that neuropsychological rehabilitation reduces cognitive symptoms in MS. However, when analysed individually, 18 out of the 20 studies showed positive effects. Cognitive training was found to improve memory span and working memory. Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention, immediate verbal memory and delayed memory.
<ABS> It is worth noting that the small numbers of patients in the studies and some methodological weaknesses reduce the level of the evidence. To further strengthen the evidence well-designed, high-quality studies are needed. 

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis' (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty studies (986 participants; 966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the participants was 44.6 years, mean length of education was 12.3 years and 70% of the participants were women. Most of the participants had a relapsing-remitting course of disease. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 3.2 and the mean duration of disease was 14.0 years.
<RES> On the basis of these studies, we found low-level evidence that neuropsychological rehabilitation reduces cognitive symptoms in MS. Cognitive training was found to improve memory span (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.002) and working memory (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, P = 0.006). Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28, P = 0.03), immediate verbal memory (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.54, P = 0.008) and delayed memory (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, P = 0.03). There was no evidence of an effect of neuropsychological rehabilitation on emotional functions.
<RES> The overall quality, as well as the comparability of the included studies, was relatively low due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures. Although most of the pooled results in the meta-analyses yielded no significant findings, 18 of the 20 studies showed some evidence of positive effects when the studies were individually analysed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Aloe vera for prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Infusion phlebitis is acute inflammation of a vein in the presence of intravenous therapy. In modern medical practice, more than 80% of inpatients will receive intravenous therapy during their admission, and about 20% to 70% of them may develop infusion phlebitis. Therefore infusion phlebitis is the most common complication of intravenous therapy. However, routine treatments for prevention or treatment of phlebitis such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory.
<ABS> The available evidence suggests that external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or combined with other non-Aloe vera treatment may be effective for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis resulting from the intravenous therapy. The conclusions should be cautiously interpreted due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 43 trials (35 RCTs and eight qRCTs) with 7465 participants were identified. Twenty-two trials with 5546 participants were involved in prevention of Aloe vera for phlebitis, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in the treatment of phlebitis. The included studies compared external application of Aloe vera alone or plus non-Aloe vera interventions with no treatment or the same non-Aloe vera interventions. The duration of the intervention lasted from one day to 15 days. Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias.
<RES> The effects of external application of fresh Aloe vera on preventing total incidence of phlebitis varied across the studies and we did not combine the data. Aloe vera reduced the occurrence of third degree phlebitis (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, P < 0.00001) and second degree phlebitis (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31, P < 0.00001) compared with no treatment. Compared with external application of 75% alcohol, or 33% MgSO4 alone, Aloe vera reduced the total incidence of phlebitis (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.28, P = 0.004 and RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78, P = 0.005 respectively) but there was no clear evidence of an effect when compared with 50% or 75% MgSO4 (total incidence of phlebitis RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.07, P = 0.07 and RR 1.10 95% CI 0.54 to 2.25, P = 0.79 respectively; third degree phlebitis (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.02, P = 0.051 and RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 18.73, P = 0.9 respectively; second degree phlebitis RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.23, P = 0.53 compared to 75% MgSO4) except for a reduction in second degree phlebitis when Aloe vera was compared with 50% MgSO4 (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50, P < 0.0001).
<RES> For the treatment of phlebitis, Aloe vera was more effective than 33% or 50% MgSO4 in terms of both any improvement (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24, P < 0.0001 and RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28, P < 0.0001 respectively) and marked improvement of phlebitis (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.70, P < 0.001 and RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.87, P = 0.0002 respectively). Compared with 50% MgSO4, Aloe vera also improved recovery rates from phlebitis (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.61, P < 0.0001). Compared with routine treatments such as external application of hirudoid, sulphonic acid mucopolysaccharide and dexamethasone used alone, addition of Aloe vera improved recovery from phlebitis (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.46, P = 0.001) and had a positive effect on overall improvement (marked improvement RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, P = 0.0003; any improvement RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35, P < 0.0001). Aloe vera, either alone or in combination with routine treatment, was more effective than routine treatment alone for improving the symptoms of phlebitis including shortening the time of elimination of red swelling symptoms, time of pain relief at the location of the infusion vein and time of resolution of phlebitis. Other secondary outcomes including health-related quality of life and adverse effects were not reported in the included studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What difficulties are caused by sleep problems brought on by Alzheimer's disease?
<ABS> People with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) frequently suffer from sleep disturbances. These can include a reduction in the time spent asleep at night, frequent wakening after falling asleep, wandering at night, waking early, and sleeping excessively during the daytime.
<ABS> These behaviours cause a lot of stress to carers, and may be associated with earlier admission to long-term care facilities (care homes) for people with AD. These behaviours can also be difficult for care-home staff to manage well.
<ABS> Can medicines help?
<ABS> Treatment with medicines is often used to try to improve the sleep of people with AD. Since the source of the sleep problems may be changes in the brain caused by AD, it is not clear whether normal sleeping pills will be effective for people with AD, and there are worries that the medicines could cause significant side effects (harms).
<ABS> The purpose of this review
<ABS> In this Cochrane review, we tried to identify the benefits and common harms of any medicine used to treat sleep problems in people with AD.
<ABS> Findings of this review
<ABS> We searched the medical literature up to 31 March 2013 for all randomized medical trials that compared any medicine used for treating sleep problems in people with AD with a fake medicine (placebo). We found five trials (313 participants) that investigated three medicines: melatonin (three trials), trazodone (one trial) and ramelteon (one trial). The ramelteon trial was commercially funded; the other trials had non-commercial funding sources. Very limited information was available for the ramelteon trial, and it came from the trial's sponsor.
<ABS> Participants in the melatonin and trazodone trials had moderate to severe dementia, while those in the ramelteon trial had mild to moderate dementia.
<ABS> The three melatonin trials had a total of 209 participants. There was no evidence that melatonin improved sleep. No serious harms were reported.
<ABS> The trazodone trial had 30 participants. It showed that a low dose of the sedative anti-depressant trazodone, 50 mg, given at night for two weeks, increased the total time spent asleep each night by an average of 43 minutes. This medicine improved sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping), but had no effect on the time spent awake after falling asleep, or on the number of times the participants woke up at night. No serious harms were reported.
<ABS> The ramelteon trial had 74 participants. The limited information available did not provide any evidence that ramelteon was better than placebo. There were no serious harms caused by ramelteon.
<ABS> The trials did not report on some of the outcomes which interested us, including quality of life and the impact on carers.
<ABS> Shortcomings of this review
<ABS> Although we searched for them, we were not able to find any trials of other sleeping medications that are commonly prescribed to people with AD.
<ABS> We concluded that there is very little evidence to guide decisions about medicines for sleeping problems in AD. Any medicine used should be used cautiously, with a careful assessment of how well it works, and its risks, and side effects in individual patients. More trials are needed to inform medical practice, with a particular need for trials investigating medicines that are commonly used for sleep problems in AD. It is essential that trials include careful assessment of side effects.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available).
<RES> The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.
<RES> We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies.
<RES> Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs. No serious adverse effects were reported.
<RES> Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon.

<H1> Interventions for the treatment of Paget's disease of the vulva

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched for randomised controlled trials (trials where treatment is allocate to women in a random manner) and well-designed non-randomised studies that compared different treatments in women aged 18 years or older with biopsy-confirmed Paget's disease of the vulva.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> and quality of evidence
<ABS> We searched scientific databases and contacted experts and identified and checked the titles and abstracts of 635 possibly relevant articles and retrieved 31 of these references in full text. However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria. We identified a number of non-randomised studies and drafted a detailed narrative of their results, but these studies were of poor quality and were at high risk of bias. Therefore, there is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of treatment is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, delaying progression or recurrence, improving quality of life or minimising toxicity. The review highlights the need for good-quality studies comparing different interventions for the management of Paget's disease of the vulva. Women and clinicians would value more evidence for guiding surgical and non-surgical management of this disease. In particular, non-invasive medical management would spare women from the adverse effects and consequences of surgery.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Comparison of two methods used in screening for colorectal cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The purpose of this review was to compare the two screening methods (FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy) in their ability to reduce the number of deaths due to cancer in the large intestine and rectum.
<ABS> We identified four trials which compared FOBT to no screening and five trials which compared flexible sigmoidoscopy to no screening. No studies compared the two methods directly. Mortality from colorectal cancer was reduced with FOBT screening and screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy. When we compared the two methods, we could not conclude that one was better than the other.
<ABS> No complications occurred after the FOBT test itself, but 0.03% of participants suffered a major complication after follow-up. Among more than 60,000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screening procedures and almost 6000 work-up colonoscopies, a major complication was recorded in 0.08% of participants. These findings should be interpreted with caution as the reporting of adverse effects was incomplete.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Cannabinoids for epilepsy

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The four reports only answered the secondary outcome about adverse effects. None of the patients in the treatment groups suffered adverse effects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> From the little evidence available, the two trials found no evidence that combined oestrogen and progestogen can prevent miscarriage (progestogen is a major class of hormones which includes progesterone) when compared with placebo or usual care. The first of the two studies indicated an increased risk for the mothers who used hormonal therapy during pregnancy of developing cancer later in life. Diethylstilboestrol is no longer in use and poses serious adverse effects while ethisterone contains androgenic properties thought to be responsible for genital abnormalities and has been replaced by progesterone.
<ABS> Overall, we acknowledge the lack of trials, especially large-scale trials, and therefore suggest further research is needed in this area before supporting or disproving the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone for the prevention of miscarriages.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included studies that compared oestrogen and progesterone versus placebo or no intervention.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) met our inclusion criteria. However, the two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate.
<RES> The second study was based on pregnant women who had undergone in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). This study showed no difference in the rate of miscarriage between the combined oestrogen and progesterone group and the no treatment group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85). The study did not report on this review's other primary outcomes (perinatal death or rates of preterm birth), nor on any of our proposed secondary outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We included 15 studies with a total of 1015 patients in this study. Of those with what CT suggests seems to be a potentially surgically curable cancer, the percentage of patients in whom more extensive cancer was found on further staging with diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy ranged between 17% and 82% across studies. The median percentage of people in whom cancer spread was not detected by CT scan was 40%. Adding staging laparoscopy to CT scan might decrease the number of patients with unremovable disease undergoing unnecessary major operations to 17% compared to those who undergo unnecessary major operation after CT scan alone (40%). This means that using diagnostic laparoscopy could halve the rate of unnecessary major open operations in patients undergoing major surgery for potentially surgically curable pancreatic cancer.


<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of most recent search: 08 February 2013.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review investigated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for preventing illness and mortality, and for promoting growth, in children between six months and 12 years of age.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Zinc is an essential micronutrient and zinc deficiency is an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. Zinc deficiency impairs growth and contributes to numerous child deaths per year due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria. This review aimed to determine if giving children zinc supplements would help prevent child death, disease, and growth deficits.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched a wide range of electronic databases for studies that randomly assigned children aged six months to 12 years to either zinc supplementation or a control group that did not receive zinc. Eighty randomised studies with 205,401 eligible participants were included in this review. The evidence is current to December 2012.
<ABS> Key results and the quality of the evidence

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 80 randomised controlled trials with 205,401 eligible participants. We did not consider that the evidence for the key analyses of morbidity and mortality outcomes were affected by risk of bias. The risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality was compatible with a reduction and a small increased risk of death with zinc supplementation (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 14 studies, high-quality evidence), and also for cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31, four studies, moderate-quality evidence), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15, three studies, moderate-quality evidence), or malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06, two studies, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Supplementation reduced diarrhoea morbidity, including the incidence of all-cause diarrhoea (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.89, 26 studies, moderate-quality evidence), but the results for LRTI and malaria were imprecise: LRTI (RR 1, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07, 12 studies, moderate-quality evidence); malaria (RR 1.05, 95% 0.95 to 1.15, four studies, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence of a very small improvement in height with supplementation (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.06; 50 studies), but the size of this effect might not be clinically important. There was a medium to large positive effect on zinc status.
<RES> Supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.46, five studies, high-quality evidence). We found no clear evidence of benefit or harm of supplementation with regard to haemoglobin or iron status. Supplementation had a negative effect on copper status.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. These disorders have both distinct and overlapping symptoms, but the underlying cause remains incompletely understood. Standard therapy for IBD includes sulfasalazine, 5-ASA drugs, steroids, immunosuppressives such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and biological agents such as infliximab. Helminths are worm-like parasites, that inhabit larger organisms. Helminths cause changes in the immune systems of their hosts including an altered immunological response to antigens and this has implications for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease which is thought to be caused by immune dysregulation.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for patients with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged. However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it. This is known as graft rejection. To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation. There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system. Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all patients after lung transplantation, and not specifically on patients with cystic fibrosis. Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using such drugs in patients with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation.
<ABS> A review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of lung transplant patients in general (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) only included three studies which had a high risk of bias. The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but tacrolimus led to a lower risk of long-term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes. Research is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in patients with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplantation.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory (lung), disabling disease which affects a lot of people worldwide and causes millions of deaths every year. People with COPD suffer differing levels of impairment, daily complaints/symptoms and number of exacerbations.
<ABS> Different health care providers, such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, typically provide different components of care (for example medication, self management and education, exercise training) to people with COPD. The aim of an integrated disease management (IDM) program is to establish a program of different components of care in which different health care providers are co-operating and collaborating to provide efficient and good quality care.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wished to determine the effect of such a program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and the number of exacerbations. We have chosen these outcomes as they are most important for people with COPD.
<ABS> We evaluated 26 studies in 2997 people with COPD. Overall the evidence found was of high to moderate quality. The trials were conducted in 11 different countries. The average age of participants was 68 years, 68% of participants were men and the severity of COPD on average was severe (according to lung function measures). Some of the trials took place in GP clinics and some in hospitals. Overall, the studies were of good to moderate methodological quality.
<ABS> People who participated in an IDM program had better quality of life and improved their exercise tolerance after 12 months. Furthermore, in participants treated with such a program, the number of hospital admissions related to exacerbations decreased and the total number of hospital days was reduced by three days. We found no evidence of an effect on mortality.
<ABS> The results support an IDM program for people with COPD to optimize quality of life and exercise tolerance.
<ABS> This plain language summary is up-to-date as of April 2012.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 26 trials involving 2997 people were included, with a follow-up ranging from 3 to 24 months. Studies were conducted in 11 different countries. The mean age of the included participants was 68 years, 68% were male and the mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)% predicted value was 44.3% (range 28% to 66%). Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings: primary (n = 8), secondary (n = 12), tertiary care (n = 1), and in both primary and secondary care (n = 5). Overall, the studies were of high to moderate methodological quality.

<H1> Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We included 36 randomised controlled trials with 2706 participants, examining the effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on seborrhoeic dermatitis. These trials were short-term; most of them lasting four weeks or less.
<ABS> The most common side-effects were burning, itching, erythema, and dryness in all treatment groups.
<ABS> Topical anti-inflammatory agents are useful in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis. Steroids are the most investigated anti-inflammatories. We still do not know the effects and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments in long-term or continuous use. This is regrettable as the disease is chronic in nature. Furthermore, there are no data concerning the effects of different treatments on quality of life.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts. The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other. Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects. The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods.
<RES> Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks). Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus. Adverse effects were similar in both groups.
<RES> There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence). Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants). Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants).
<RES> There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids.
<RES> We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events. The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment. In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment.
<RES> Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile. Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects.
<CON> Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less. Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts. The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed. There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms. For many people the main feature is a painful headache. Other symptoms include feeling sick, vomiting, disturbed vision, and sensitivity to light, sound, and smells.
<ABS> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat migraine headaches. One NSAID is naproxen. On 22 May 2013, we looked for clinical trials where naproxen was used to treat migraine headache. We found six good quality studies with about 2700 people.
<ABS> Naproxen is not a good drug for treating migraine at the doses of 500 mg or 825 mg used in the studies we found.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included six studies using naproxen 275 mg, 500 mg, or 825 mg to treat attacks of moderate or severe pain intensity. Overall, 1241 participants took naproxen (275 mg to 825 mg), 229 took sumatriptan 50 mg, 173 took naratriptan 2.5 mg, and 1092 took placebo. No studies combined naproxen with an antiemetic. Studies using naproxen 275 mg provided no useable data for analysis.
<RES> There were insufficient data for analysis of naproxen compared with sumatriptan, and no data suitable for analysis of naproxen compared with naratriptan.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Naproxen is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 11 for pain-free response at two hours


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: effects on growth

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: We reviewed the evidence on whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) could affect growth in children with persistent asthma, that is, a more severe asthma that requires regular use of medications for control of symptoms.
<ABS> Background: Treatment guidelines for asthma recommend ICS as first-line therapy for children with persistent asthma. Although ICS treatment is generally considered safe in children, parents and physicians always remain concerned about the potential negative effect of ICS on growth.
<ABS> Search date: We searched trials published until January 2014.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included in this review trials comparing daily use of corticosteroids, delivered by any type of inhalation device for at least three months, versus placebo or non-steroidal drugs in children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma.
<ABS> Key results: Twenty-five trials involving 8471 children with mild to moderate persistent asthma (5128 treated with ICS and 3343 treated with placebo or non-steroidal drugs) were included in this review. Eighty percent of these trials were conducted in more than two different centres and were called multi-centre studies; five were international multi-centre studies conducted in high-income and low-income countries across Africa, Asia-Pacifica, Europe and the Americas. Sixty-eight percent were financially supported by pharmaceutical companies.
<ABS> Meta-analysis (a statistical technique that combines the results of several studies and provides a high level of evidence) suggests that children treated daily with ICS may grow approximately half a centimeter per year less than those not treated with these medications during the first year of treatment. The magnitude of ICS-related growth reduction may depend on the type of drug. Growth reduction seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment. Evidence provided by this review allows us to conclude that daily use of ICS can cause a small reduction in height in children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma; this effect seems minor compared with the known benefit of these medications for asthma control.
<ABS> Quality of evidence: Eleven of 25 trials did not report how they guaranteed that participants had an equal chance of receiving ICS or placebo or non-steroidal drugs. All but six trials did not report how researchers were kept unaware of the treatment assignment list. However, this methodological limitation may not significantly affect the quality of evidence because the results remained almost unchanged when we excluded these trials from the analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 trials involving 8471 (5128 ICS-treated and 3343 control) children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. Six molecules (beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, ciclesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and mometasone fumarate) given at low or medium daily doses were used during a period of three months to four to six years. Most trials were blinded and over half of the trials had drop out rates of over 20%.
<RES> Compared with placebo or non-steroidal drugs, ICS produced a statistically significant reduction in linear growth velocity (14 trials with 5717 participants, MD -0.48 cm/y, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.30, moderate quality evidence) and in the change from baseline in height (15 trials with 3275 participants; MD -0.61 cm/y, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.38, moderate quality evidence) during a one-year treatment period.
<RES> One trial with follow-up into adulthood showed that participants of prepubertal age treated with budesonide 400 μg/d for a mean duration of 4.3 years had a mean reduction of 1.20 cm (95% CI -1.90 to -0.50) in adult height compared with those treated with placebo.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%. Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis. We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP). Although psoriasis is rarely life-threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly.
<ABS> Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis. The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), broad-band ultraviolet B (BB-UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA). PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen. NB-UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB-UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB-UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB-UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation).
<ABS> This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants. Most of these were of poor methodological quality.
<ABS> For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB-UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs. In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA. The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA.
<ABS> Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis. One RCT found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side-effects.
<ABS> In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate.
<ABS> In summary, NB-UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use. NB-UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP. Evidence regarding NB-UVB and conventional BB-UVB is limited. The long-term safety of NB-UVB needs to be confirmed. The efficacy of NB-UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 662 participants. We report the results of intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) here. Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant-rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate.
<RES> In one RCT of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference in PASI 75 was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality). In three other RCTs of CPP, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; N = 54), and in the other two, the clearance rates were statistically significantly in favour of oral PUVA: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; N = 93 and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; N = 100, respectively. Pooled data from these three studies indicated that withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different between either group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.54; N = 247; low quality).
<RES> The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate for CPP was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the NB-UVB and bath PUVA groups (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.91; N = 92; low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71; N = 36; low quality).
<RES> In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56; N = 50; low quality).
<RES> Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or GP in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.10; N = 90; low quality).
<RES> One RCT in people with CPP found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB in terms of clearance rate (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.13; N = 100; low quality) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.87; N = 100; low quality).
<RES> No studies reported our primary outcomes for NB-UVB compared with conventional BB-UVB.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> NB-UVB is considered ineffective for PPP in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA for clearing PPP. NB-UVB seemed to be similar to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP.
<CON> Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of NB-UVB.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A parastomal hernia is defined as an incisional hernia related to a stoma and belongs to the most common stoma-related complications. Many factors concerning the operative technique that are considered to influence the incidence of parastomal herniation have been investigated. However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation and other important stoma complications for patients.
<ABS> Nine retrospective cohort studies with a total of 761 participants met the inclusion criteria. All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation), and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse). None of the included studies compared the two interventions with regard to other secondary outcomes. There was neither a significant difference in terms of the risk for parastomal herniation nor with regard to the occurrence of stomal prolapse.
<ABS> In summary, the quality of the identified evidence is too poor to allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review. This highlights the need for randomized trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the lateral pararectal versus the transrectal approach in preventing parastomal herniation and other stoma-related and patient-important morbidity in people requiring enterostomy placement.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine retrospective cohort studies with a total of 761 participants met the inclusion criteria. All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation), and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse). None of the included studies compared the two interventions with regard to other secondary outcomes.
<RES> There was neither a significant difference in terms of the risk for parastomal herniation (risk ratio (RR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.1) nor with regard to the occurrence of stomal prolapse (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.39 to 3.85). An I² value of 65% indicated substantial statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Aromatase inhibitors for women with uterine fibroids

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are aromatase Inhibitors safe and effective for treating uterine fibroids?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Only one RCT study, consisting of 70 participants, was found. The study was conducted in teaching hospitals in Iran and Germany. It did not report on changes in fibroid-related symptoms or on the source of study funding.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review authors concluded that, to date, evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of AI drugs in treating women with uterine fibroids.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Respiratory problems in people with cystic fibrosis are mainly due to repeated lung infections. Culturing sputum samples often allows quick identification of the organism causing the infection and early treatment. If patients (most young children and some adults) can not provide sputum samples, swabs are taken from the upper throat to identify the organism causing the infection in the lower airways – but this may not be the most reliable method.
<ABS> During a bronchoscopy, clinicians examine the lower airways using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and camera at one end; they may also collect mucus. This requires patients to be in hospital and be sedated or have a general anaesthetic. It is not certain if treatment based on bronchoscopy samples is better than that based on throat swabs.
<ABS> We searched for studies of participants of any age, but this review only includes one study in young children. The study randomly assigned 170 babies under six months of age with cystic fibrosis to receive antibiotics for chest infections based on samples taken by either bronchoscopy or from the throat. Outcomes were assessed at five years of age; 157 children completed the study.
<ABS> This study did not show any difference between the groups in lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a CT scan of the lungs at five years of age. Additionally, there were no differences in how many children in each group had an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at five years of age, or per year of follow up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms. Patients in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often than the other group, although admissions were generally shorter.
<ABS> Adverse events reported during, and after bronchoscopy, were not serious and generally well tolerated; the most common was increased coughing (noted in one third of patients).
<ABS> This study was limited because fewer patients were recruited than the study needed. As the treatment of initial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups. Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult.
<ABS> There is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in young patients with cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of latest search: 28 November 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified nine studies, but only one study with data from 157 participants (170 patients were enrolled) was eligible for inclusion in the review. This study compared outcomes following therapy directed by bronchoalveolar lavage for pulmonary exacerbations during the first five years of life with standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures. The study enrolled infants with CF who were under six months of age and diagnosed through newborn screening and followed them until they were five years old.
<RES> We considered this study to have a low risk of bias; however, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was limited due to the prevalence (of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples at five years age) being much lower in both the groups compared to that which was expected and which was used for the power calculation. The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in high-resolution computed tomography scoring. The quality of evidence for the key parameters was graded as moderate except for high-resolution computed tomography scoring, which was graded as high.
<RES> At five years of age, there was no clear benefit of bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy on lung function z scores or nutritional parameters. Evaluation of total and component high-resolution computed tomography scores showed no significant difference in evidence of structural lung disease in the two groups.
<RES> In addition, this study did not show any difference between the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per child per year diagnosed in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group compared to the standard therapy group. The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment was comparable in the two groups, as were the number of pulmonary exacerbations. However, the number of hospitalizations was significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group, but the mean duration of hospitalizations was significantly less compared to the standard therapy group.
<RES> Mild adverse events were reported in a proportion of patients, but these were generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures. Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4.8% of procedures.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray (Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review. We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia. The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care. All results are 'low or very low quality evidence'.
<RES> Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99).
<RES> The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99).
<RES> In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three-year follow-up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20). The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three-year follow-up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91).
<RES> No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people living in long-term care (LTC).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and some help with day to day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24-hour nursing care. Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC. People with delirium usually become more confused over a few hours or a couple of days. Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy but others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition. It can also increase the chances of being admitted to hospital and developing dementia, and LTC residents who develop delirium are at increased risk of death.
<ABS> Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main risk factors for delirium. For example: providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; avoiding medications which increase delirium risk.
<ABS> This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to 04/2013. We found two studies that included 3636 participants. Both studies were done in the United States.
<ABS> The first study tested whether delirium can be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring that hydration was provided by giving regular drinks. 98 people participated in the study, which lasted four weeks.
<ABS> The second study tested the effect of a computer programme which searched prescriptions for medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium so that a pharmacist could adjust or stop them. 3538 people participated in the study, which lasted 12 months.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> The first study found that the hydration intervention did not reduce delirium. However, this was a small study of short duration with serious design problems.
<ABS> The second study found that the computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review reduced delirium but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls. One problem with the findings of this study is that it might not be possible to use this computer programme in different countries that do not have similar computer systems.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> There is very low-quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium in older people in LTC. It is therefore not possible to draw firm conclusions.
<ABS> There is moderate-quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review may reduce the incidence of delirium in older people in LTC.
<ABS> There is no clear evidence that a computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review reduces hospitalisation, mortality or falls for older people in LTC.
<ABS> As this review only found a very small number of research studies, we have recommended that further research should be conducted testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people living in LTC. This may help improve the quality of care for this vulnerable group.
<ABS> External funding
<ABS> There was no source of external funding for this review.
<ABS> Conflicts of interest

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Tiotropium versus ipratropium bromide in the management of COPD

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that includes the conditions chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is mainly caused by smoking or inhaling dust, which leads to blockage or narrowing of the airways. The symptoms include breathlessness and a chronic cough. Tiotropium is an inhaled medication, taken once a day, to help widen the airways (bronchodilator) and is used in the management of COPD. Ipratropium bromide is also a bronchodilator but has a shorter duration of action and has to be taken several times a day.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> We found two studies including 1073 participants that compared the long-term effectiveness and side effects of tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide. One trial was 12 weeks long and one was a year long. The people included in the studies had moderate to severe COPD (average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 40% the predicted value).
<ABS> Compared to ipratropium bromide, tiotropium treatment led to improved lung function, fewer COPD exacerbations, fewer hospital admissions (including those for exacerbations of COPD) and improved quality of life. Tiotropium appears to be safer with fewer adverse events, but there was no significant difference in deaths with ipratropium bromide when compared to tiotropium.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall the evidence was of moderate to high quality. Tiotrpium is available in two different inhalers, Respimat and Handihaler. There are some safety concerns regarding the safety of the Respimat device but we await the publication of a trial before we can conclusively say that this is the case; and this will be reported in another Cochrane Review.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Based on this review, tiotropium has more benefits than ipratropium bromide for people with stable moderate to severe COPD.
<ABS> The review was current as of November 2012.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review included two studies of good methodological quality that enrolled 1073 participants with COPD. The studies used a similar design and inclusion criteria and were of at least 12 weeks duration; the participants had a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% predicted value at baseline. One study used tiotropium via the HandiHaler (18 µg) for 12 months and the other via the Respimat device (5 µg and 10 µg) for 12 weeks. In general, the treatment groups were well matched at baseline but not all outcomes were reported for both studies. Overall the risk of bias across the included RCTs was low.
<RES> For primary outcomes this review found that at the three months trough (the lowest level measured before treatment) FEV1 significantly increased with tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide (mean difference (MD) 109 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI) 81 to 137, moderate quality evidence, I2 = 62%). There were fewer people experiencing one or more non-fatal serious adverse events on tiotropium compared to ipratropium (odds ratio (OR) 0.5; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.73, high quality evidence). This represents an absolute reduction in risk from 176 to 97 per 1000 people over three to 12 months. Concerning disease specific adverse events, the tiotropium group were also less likely to experience a COPD-related serious adverse event when compared to ipratropium bromide (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85, moderate quality evidence).


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Alternating and combined antipyretics for treatment of fever in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When they are ill with infections, children often develop a fever. The fever with common viral illnesses, such as colds, coughs, sore throats and gastrointestinal illness, usually lasts a few days, makes children feel unwell, and is distressing for the children, their parents, or other caregivers.
<ABS> Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) and ibuprofen lower the child's temperature and relieve their discomfort. This review evaluates whether giving both treatments together, or alternating the two treatments, is more effective than giving paracetamol or ibuprofen alone.
<ABS> In September 2013, we found six studies, involving 915 children, that evaluated combined or alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen to treat fever in children.
<ABS> Compared to giving ibuprofen or paracetamol alone, giving both medications together is probably more effective at lowering temperature for the first four hours after treatment (moderate quality evidence). However, only one trial assessed whether combined treatment made children less uncomfortable or distressed and found no difference compared to ibuprofen or paracetamol alone.
<ABS> In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child continues to have a fever. Giving alternating treatment in this way may be more effective at lowering temperature for the first three hours after the second dose (low quality evidence), and may also result in less child discomfort (low quality evidence)
<ABS> Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy and found no advantages between the two (very low quality evidence).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included.
<RES> Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy. No statistically significant differences were seen in mean temperature, or the number of febrile children at one, four or six hours (one trial, 40 participants, very low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no serious adverse events in the trials that were directly attributed to the medications used.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Healthcare workers can hurt themselves accidentally with needles or sharp instruments that have been used in patient care. This carries a small risk that the healthcare worker becomes infected with a viral disease such as hepatitis or HIV. Therefore it is important to prevent blood contact to prevent infection. We evaluated whether the use of gloves, more than one layer of gloves or special gloves can prevent needles or sharp instruments from piercing the skin. Up until June 2013, we found 34 studies that evaluated 6890 operations. There were no studies in non-surgical staff.
<ABS> Two pairs of gloves compared to one pair only
<ABS> In 12 studies, two pairs of gloves reduced the number of perforations in gloves by 71% compared to the use of one pair of gloves. In three studies, two pairs of gloves reduced blood stains on the skin by 65%. The reduction in self reported needlestick injuries was less clear.
<ABS> Three pairs of gloves compared to two pairs of ordinary gloves
<ABS> One low-quality study showed that triple gloves compared to double gloves can further reduce perforations.
<ABS> A pair of thicker or special gloves compared to a pair of ordinary gloves
<ABS> Five low-quality studies showed that the number of perforations was similar for thicker and thinner gloves. In two low-quality studies, the use of one pair of fabric gloves over one pair of normal gloves reduced perforations compared to two pairs of normal gloves. This was similar for gloves made from special material such as fabric or steel, used in between normal gloves.
<ABS> Indicator gloves
<ABS> Indicator gloves show a coloured spot when they are pierced. Two studies showed that they reduced the number of perforations per glove but not the total amount of perforations.
<ABS> Sensitivity of the fingers
<ABS> There were no indications that using more layers of gloves decreased sensitivity of the fingers.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Surgeons and surgical staff can reduce their risk of contracting a serious viral infection by wearing two pairs of gloves instead of one pair of gloves. The use of three glove layers or gloves made from special material probably reduces the risk further but these need better evaluation. We need further studies to evaluate whether gloves have a similar preventive effect in other healthcare professionals outside the operating theatre.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found 34 RCTs that included 6890 person-operations as participating units and reported on 46 intervention-control group comparisons. We grouped interventions as follows: increased layers of standard gloves, gloves manufactured with special protective materials or thicker gloves, and gloves with puncture indicator systems. Indicator gloves show a coloured spot when they are perforated. Participants were surgeons in all studies and they used at least one pair of standard gloves as the control intervention. Twenty-seven studies also included other surgical staff (e.g. nurses). All but one study used perforations in gloves as an indication of exposure. The median control group rate was 18.5 perforations per 100 person-operations. Seven studies reported blood stains on the skin and two studies reported self reported needlestick injuries. Six studies reported dexterity as visual analogue scale scores for the comparison double versus single gloves, 13 studies reported outer glove perforations. We judged the included studies to have a moderate to high risk of bias.
<RES> We found moderate-quality evidence that double gloves compared to single gloves reduce the risk of glove perforation (rate ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.37) and the risk of blood stains on the skin (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70). Two studies with a high risk of bias also reported the effect of double compared to single gloves on needlestick injuries (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.62).
<RES> We found low-quality evidence in one small study that the use of three gloves compared to two gloves reduces the risk of perforation further (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.52). There was similar low-quality evidence that the use of one fabric glove over one normal glove reduces perforations compared to two normal gloves (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.93). There was moderate-quality evidence that this effect was similar for the use of one special material glove between two normal material gloves. Thicker gloves did not perform better than thinner gloves.
<RES> There was moderate to low-quality evidence in two studies that an indicator system does not reduce the total number of perforations during an operation even though it reduces the number of perforations per glove used.
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence that double gloves have a similar number of outer glove perforations as single gloves, indicating that there is no loss of dexterity with double gloves (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.31).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We have tried to identify evidence as to whether there is a difference in the outcomes of treatment with or without antibiotics for non-severe pneumonia in children aged 2 to 59 months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We performed a search for clinical trials published until March 2014 that evaluated this question. We were unable to identify any studies that were conducted on our review question.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the search results and extracted data.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> To assess the effects of reminder systems to increase uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Some women experience high blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy (termed GDM). Although these high blood glucose concentrations usually normalise immediately after birth, women who have experienced GDM are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. It is therefore important that they are regularly tested for higher than normal blood glucose levels (to detect type 2 diabetes or 'impaired glucose tolerance' which is a prediabetic state sometimes preceding type 2 diabetes), starting in the months after they have given birth. However, for a variety of reasons, many women do not get their blood glucose tested after experiencing GDM.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A single study of 256 women who had experienced GDM whether posting reminder letters to 213 women or their doctors, three months after the birth of a baby, would help to increase the number of women taking a blood glucose test compared with 43 women sent no reminder.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> This study showed that, compared with no reminder, a postal reminder was around two to four times (depending on the blood glucose test concerned) more likely to encourage women who had experienced GDM to take a blood glucose test three months after having their baby. It did not seem to make a difference if the reminder was sent to the woman only, the physician only or to both the woman and the physician.
<ABS> The trial did not assess women's quality of life, or how many women were subsequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose results after giving birth.
<ABS> Other kinds of reminders such as email and telephone need to be assessed in studies as they might be easier and more convenient for women than posted reminders. We need to know more about women's preferences and attitudes, and also to find out whether increasing the chances of a woman being tested helps to reduce her risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future, for example by encouraging a healthier diet and more exercise.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was considered low as the only included study involved few numbers of participants and provided imprecise results.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of June 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial with an unclear risk of bias in the majority of domains was included in the study; the overall study quality was judged to be low. This factorial trial of 256 women compared three types of postal reminder strategies (in a total of 213 women) with usual care (no postal reminder, 43 women) and reported on the uptake of four possible types of glucose tests. The three strategies investigated were: reminders sent to both the woman and the physician; reminder sent to the woman only; and reminder sent to the physician only, all issued approximately three months after the woman had given birth.
<RES> The trial did not report this review's other primary outcomes (proportion of women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or showing impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose after giving birth; or health-related quality of life). Nor did it report any secondary review outcomes such as diabetes-associated morbidity, lifestyle changes, need for insulin, recurrence of GDM or women's and/or health professionals' views of the intervention. No adverse events of the intervention were reported.
<RES> Subgroup interaction tests gave no indication that dual reminders (to both women and physicians) were more successful than single reminders to either women or physicians alone. It was also not clear if test uptakes between women in the reminder and no reminder groups differed by type of glucose test undertaken.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Atypical antipsychotics for psychosis in adolescents

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by Benjamin Gray, Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness (Email: ben.gray@rethink.org).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants. We found no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response. Trials were classified into the following groups.
<RES> 1. Atypical antipsychotics versus placeboOnly two studies compared one atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo. In one study, the number of non-responders treated with olanzapine was not different from the number treated with placebo (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10); however, significantly more (57% vs 32%) people left the study early (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) from the placebo group compared with the olanzapine group. With regard to adverse effects, young people treated with aripiprazole had significantly lower serum cholesterol compared with those given placebo (1 RCT, n = 302, RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.58).
<RES> 2. Atypical antipsychotics versus typical antipsychoticsWhen the findings of all five trials comparing atypical antipsychotic medications with a typical antipsychotic medication were collated, no difference in the mean end point Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was noted between the two arms (5 RCTs, n = 236, MD -1.08, 95% CI -3.08 to 0.93). With regard to adverse effects, the mean end point serum prolactin concentration was much higher than the reference range for treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and molindone in one of the studies. However, fewer adolescents who were receiving atypical antipsychotic medications left the study because of adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or for any reason (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97).
<RES> 3. One atypical antipsychotic versus another atypical antipsychoticThe mean end point BPRS score was not significantly different for people who received risperidone compared with those who received olanzapine; however, the above data were highly skewed. Overall no difference was noted in the number of people leaving the studies early because of any adverse effects between each study arm in the three studies comparing olanzapine and risperidone (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.04). Specific adverse events were not reported uniformly across the six different studies included in this section of the review; therefore it was difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of adverse events for different atypical antipsychotic medications.
<RES> 4. Lower-dose atypical antipsychotic versus standard/higher-dose atypical antipsychoticThree studies reported comparisons of lower doses of the atypical antipsychotic medication with standard/higher doses of the same medication. One study reported better symptom reduction with a standard dose of risperidone as compared with a low dose (1 RCT, n = 257, RR -8.00, 95% CI -13.75 to -2.25). In another study, no difference was reported in the number of participants not achieving remission between the group receiving 10 mg/d and those who received 30 mg/d of aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 196, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Similarly in the other study, authors reported no statistically significant difference in clinical response between the two groups receiving lower-dose (80 mg/d) and higher-dose (160 mg/d) ziprasidone, as reflected by the mean end point BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 17, MD -4.40, 95% CI -19.20 to 10.40).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: To compare the effectiveness and safety of the addition of an anti-leukotriene agent to ICS to the use of the same dose of ICS alone, an increased dose of ICS, or a reduced dose of ICS in children aged one to 18 years with persistent asthma who are not well controlled with ICS alone.
<ABS> Results: Whether comparing the addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS to the same dose or an increased dose of ICS, there was no difference in the number of participants experiencing one or more moderate exacerbations (that is, requiring oral corticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (i.e. requiring a hospital admission). A single study comparing the same ICS dose reported lung function tests and showed no or small group differences depending on the test used.
<ABS> Conclusion: There is no firm evidence to support that adding montelukast to ICS is safe and effective to reduce the occurrence of moderate or severe asthma attacks in children taking low-dose ICS and whose symptoms remain uncontrolled. After being on the market for more than 10 years, the limited number of available studies testing antileukotrienes in children, the absence of data on preschoolers, and the inconsistency of available trials in reporting of efficacy and safety clinical outcomes is disappointing and limit the conclusions.
<ABS> Quality of the results: This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with asthma; none were conducted in preschoolers. As a single study of moderate duration reported all measures of efficacy and most measures of safety, our confidence in the quality of evidence is low. Other important measures of asthma control were either not measured or reported in different formats, so they could not be pooled. In other words, there are too few paediatric trials to conclude firmly whether either treatment is superior to the other.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We searched several medical databases and trial registries up to January 2013 and contacted researchers. We found one study that looked at the comparison we were interested in. This study was potentially biased, mainly because the care providers, parents and children were aware of the type of pain relief the children received. The study was small, involving 55 children aged 16 months to 15 years, and showed that the children who received one of the two main types of nerve block tended to have less pain after 30 minutes than those who received intravenous morphine for initial pain control. The nerve blocks led to some pain and redness at the injection site in a few cases, while intravenous morphine caused more serious problems such as depressed breathing (lack of oxygen), excessive sleepiness and vomiting in a small number of children.
<ABS> Moreover, children who had nerve blocks continued to have lower pain scores over a six-hour period with less need for additional pain relief. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether children or parents were more satisfied with one method of pain relief than the other. Use of resources (e.g. nursing time, cost of medications) was not measured.
<ABS> The quality of the study included in this review was low and so these conclusions are not certain. Further well designed studies investigating whether nerve blocks are more effective and safer than other means of pain relief are needed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years. It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate. The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> One study (19 participants) met our inclusion criteria. It showed that high-flow nasal cannula therapy is well tolerated as a treatment for bronchiolitis. Oxygen saturations (blood oxygen levels) were better at eight and 12 hours in participants receiving high-flow nasal cannula therapy than in those receiving oxygen therapy via a head box, but were similar between groups at 24 hours, although this may have been due to higher oxygen flow rates in the high-flow nasal cannula group. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in the duration of oxygen therapy, length of hospitalisation and time to discharge. No adverse events were reported in either group.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula therapy for treating bronchiolitis in infants. The included study provides some indication that HFNC therapy is feasible and well tolerated. However, our evidence is based on one low-quality, small study with uncertainty about the effects and some possibility of bias arising from the study methods. Further research is required to determine the role of high-flow nasal cannula therapy in the management of bronchiolitis in infants. The results of six ongoing studies identified will contribute to the evidence in future updates of this review.
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract illness, usually of viral aetiology, affecting infants younger than 24 months of age and is a frequent cause of hospitalisation. It causes airway inflammation, mucus production and mucous plugging, resulting in airway obstruction. Effective pharmacotherapy is lacking and bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pregnancy profoundly affects the management of diabetes and having diabetes can lead to complications in pregnancy. The most common complications are early births, large babies, difficult births and the need for caesarean section. Increased risks for the infants at birth include bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage), the baby’s shoulder becomes stuck (shoulder dystocia), neonatal low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), jaundice and respiratory distress. The babies are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, and the growing child has an increased risk of having diabetes. Women with existing diabetes that is not well controlled at the time of conception and in the first trimester are at increased risk of miscarriage, having a baby with malformations or a stillbirth.
<ABS> The review determined that there is not enough evidence to say with any certainty which monitoring method is best. The nine included trials involved a total of 506 women (436 women with Type 1 diabetes and 70 women with Type 2 diabetes). The trials were from European countries and the USA. The trials looked at different techniques of monitoring and reported on different outcomes. Three comparisons were from single trials only. The number of women in each study was generally small. Five of the nine included studies were at moderate risk of bias and four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias.
<ABS> More research is needed to find out which monitoring method is best at reducing the risk of complications.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials. The following comparisons were included in the review: (1) self-monitoring versus standard care, (2) self-monitoring versus hospitalisation, (3) pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring, (4) automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system, (5) CGM versus intermittent monitoring and (6) constant CGM versus intermittent CGM.


<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials by using a predeveloped form. We contacted authors of original trials to request additional unpublished data as required. We recorded baseline characteristics of participants, interventions, comparisons, follow-up and outcome measures to enable assessment of clinical homogeneity. Clinical relevance was independently assessed by using the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), and risk of bias within studies was determined by using CBRG criteria.
<MaM> We pooled individual study results in a meta-analysis when appropriate. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) when the same measurement scales were used in all studies and the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measurement scales were used. Whenreported means and standard deviations of the outcomes showed that outcome data were skewed, we log-transformed data for all studies in the comparison and performed a meta-analysis on the log-scale. Results of analyses performed on the log-scale were converted back to the original scale. We used a fixed-effect inverse variance model to measure treatment effect when no substantial evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found. When we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random-effects inverse variance model.
<MaM> The primary outcome measure was functional status as measured by a back-specific functional scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of leg pain, low back pain and global improvement/general health. We considered statistical significance and clinical relevance of outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome on the basis of five criteria, for which evidence was ranked from high to very low quality, depending on the number of criteria met.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our searches yielded 1,726 results, and a total of three studies (N = 373 participants) were included in the review and meta-analysis. All studies were deemed to have low risk of bias; no study had unacceptably high dropout rates. Also, no unacceptably unbalanced dropout rates, unacceptably low adherence rates or non-adherence to the protocol or clearly significant unbalanced baseline differences were noted for the primary outcome.
<RES> Outcomes in the short term (within six months postoperative)
<RES> Outcomes in the long term (at 12 months postoperative)
<RES> None of the included papers reported any relevant adverse events.

<H1> Creatine for Parkinson's disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Creatine for Parkinson's disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Creatine has been shown to help improve mitochondrial function and may, therefore, useful for treating people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence on whether creatine is effective and safe to treat people with Parkinson's disease, used alone or as an adjuvant treatment, up to 10 November 2013.
<ABS> We included two randomized controlled trials with a total of 194 patients that compared creatine with placebo for people with Parkinson's disease. The effect of creatine on improvement of motor function, activities of daily living or quality of life after one or two years treatment for Parkinson's disease was uncertain due to the low quality of the trials and the small number of participants they recruited. The serious adverse events that occurred in the trials were not thought to be related to creatine. However, one trial reported higher rates of gastro-intestinal effects (including diarrhoea, nausea and constipation) with creatine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Accommodation is the ability of the eye to focus on both distant and near objects.
<ABS> Accommodation is achieved through the contraction of ciliary muscles, which results in an increase in curvature and a forward shift of the natural lens in the eye. Accommodation declines with increasing age due to a decrease in lens elasticity and a reduction in ciliary muscle contraction, resulting in difficulty in near vision (presbyopia). This is a problem for most people in their 40s or 50s.
<ABS> For best optical performance, the lens must be transparent. Cataract is the clouding of the human lens. It is more common with increasing age, and is a common cause of visual impairment. Fortunately, cataract is treatable by a surgical procedure in which the natural lens is removed through a small incision. Once all lens material is removed, an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted into the eye to lie in the original position of the removed natural lens.
<ABS> All functions of the natural lens are preserved by an IOL, with the exception of accommodation. Standard IOLs, known as monofocal IOLs, allow only distant objects to be focused and seen clearly. Patients require spectacles for near vision. This problem after cataract surgery remains a challenge for ophthalmologists. To overcome the loss of accommodation after cataract surgery, various strategies have been tried with variable success.
<ABS> Accommodative IOLs have been designed to restore accommodation. The aim of this systematic review is to help define the extent to which accommodative IOLs improve near vision in comparison with standard monofocal IOLs.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review looked at four studies that enrolled 229 people (256 eyes) and compared the use of accommodative IOLs to the use of monofocal IOLs in cataract surgery. We last searched for evidence in October 2013.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall the quality of the evidence was low or very low with the exception for the findings on near vision at six months.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs, including 229 participants (256 eyes), conducted in Germany, Italy and the UK. The age range of participants was 21 to 87 years. All studies included people who had bilateral cataracts with no pre-existing ocular pathologies. We judged all studies to be at high risk of performance bias. We graded two studies with high risk of detection bias and one study with high risk of selection bias.
<RES> The relative effect of the lenses on reading speed and spectacle independence was uncertain, The average reading speed was 11.6 words per minute more in the accommodative lens group but the 95% confidence intervals ranged from 12.2 words less to 35.4 words more (1 study, 40 people, low quality evidence). People with accommodative lenses were more likely to be spectacle-independent but the estimate was very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 8.18; 95% CI 0.47 to 142.62, 1 study, 40 people, very low quality evidence).
<RES> More cases of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) were seen in accommodative lenses but the effect of the lenses on PCO was uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.12; 95% CI 0.45 to 10.02, 91 people, 2 studies, low quality evidence). People in the accommodative lens group were more likely to require laser capsulotomy (Peto OR 7.96; 95% CI 2.49 to 25.45, 2 studies, 60 people, 80 eyes, low quality evidence). Glare was reported less frequently with accommodative lenses but the relative effect of the lenses on glare was uncertain (RR any glare 0.78; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.90, 1 study, 40 people, and RR moderate/severe glare 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.60, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate-quality evidence that study participants who received accommodative IOLs had a small gain in near visual acuity after six months. There is some evidence that distance visual acuity with accommodative lenses may be worse after 12 months but due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of effect, the evidence for this is not clear-cut. People receiving accommodative lenses had more PCO which may be associated with poorer distance vision. However, the effect of the lenses on PCO was uncertain.
<CON> Risks of bias, heterogeneity of outcome measures and study designs used, and the dominance of one design of accommodative lens in existing trials (the HumanOptics 1CU) mean that these results should be interpreted with caution. They may not be applicable to other accommodative IOL designs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cardiogenic shock occurring in 5% to 10% of patients with acute myocardial infarction still remains a life-threatening complication. As regards treatment options with inotropic and vasoactive drugs for infarct related cardiogenic shock, there is only very little evidence generated by randomised controlled trials.
<ABS> We included four small randomised controlled trials with a total of 66 participants. Mortality rates ranged from 18% to 47% in the four studies. Only one inotropic drug and one vasodilative were studied in four different comparisons with other active drugs or placebo.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one small randomised controlled trial with three participants was found for vasodilator strategies (nitric oxide gas versus placebo) in AMI complicated by CS or LCOS. This study was too small to draw any conclusions on the effects on our key outcomes.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Image guided surgery for the resection of brain tumours

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgery has a key role in the management of many types of brain tumour. In some types of brain tumour the amount that can be removed by the surgeon is very important in helping patients live longer and feel better. However, sometimes removing a brain tumour can be difficult, because it either looks like normal brain tissue or is near brain tissue that is very important to making people function normally. New methods of visualising tumours during surgery have been developed to help surgeons better identify tumour from normal brain tissue.
<ABS> Question
<ABS> 1. Is image guided surgery more effective at removing brain tumours than surgery without image guidance?
<ABS> 2. Is one image guidance technology or tool better than another?
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Our search strategy was up to date as of March 2013. We found four trials looking at four different types of tools to help improve the amount of tumour that is removed. The tumour that they looked at was usually high grade glioma but one study also included patients with low grade glioma. Imaging interventions used during surgery included magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) during surgery to assess the amount of remaining tumour, or a fluorescent dye (5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)) to mark out the tumour. Two trials used pre-operative imaging to map out the location of a tumour, which was then used at the time of surgery to guide the resection (neuronavigation). All the studies were at significant risk of bias and some were small and stopped early. Others were funded by the manufacturers of the image guidance tool involved.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found low quality evidence that using image guided surgery can lead to more of the tumour being removed surgically in some people. It has not been proven that any of the techniques that were evaluated improve overall survival. Data about how each technique can affect a patient's quality of life was poorly reported. The side effects of each technique were also poorly reported, but they did not appear to be more common with image guided surgery. There is a concern that taking out more of the tumour using 5-ALA can lead to patients having a type of stroke early after surgery but long-term the risk seems to be no different between techniques. There was very low quality evidence for neuronavigation and no trials were identified for ultrasound guidance.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence for image guided surgery in removing brain tumours is sparse and of low quality. Further research is needed to assess two main questions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Data for quality of life (QoL) were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy review looked at the evidence for the radiology test computed tomography angiography (CTA), which demonstrates blood flow in the main vessels of the brain, to support the results of clinical tests of brain function performed in unconscious patients on mechanical breathing machines who are thought by their doctors to have died.
<ABS> Ten studies were found, including 366 patients in total. Most of the studies were performed in intensive care departments but involved only small numbers of patients. In most studies it would be possible for the doctors performing the CTA test to already know the results of the clinical test. This might affect the study results, however this situation would also be the case in normal medical practice. Methods used to report the CTA study also varied from study to study and so the published results were re-analysed to take this into account.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Amphetamine dependence constitutes a public health problem with many consequences and complications. Amphetamine abuse refers to a maladaptive and hazardous pattern of use considered to be less severe than dependence. To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for amphetamine abuse or dependence, and psychotherapy remains the best treatment option.
<ABS> Long-term amphetamine use reduces dopamine levels in the brain. Drugs increasing dopamine and mimicking the effects of amphetamines with lower abuse liability could be used as replacement therapy in amphetamine dependence. Several psychostimulants have been studied recently for this purpose.
<ABS> In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied. We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine-dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil. Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants. The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks.
<ABS> Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo. Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments. Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts.
<ABS> Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence. The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why corticosteroids might help
<ABS> This review tried to find out whether giving corticosteroids around the time of facial plastic surgery reduces swelling and bruising compared to another intervention, no intervention, or a fake medicine (placebo).
<ABS> Therefore, the current evidence does not support use of corticosteroids as a routine treatment in facial plastic surgery. More trials will need to be conducted before it can be established whether this treatment works and is safe.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder characterised by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, constipation or diarrhoea or both. It is difficult to treat because no single cause has been identified. IBS impairs health-related quality of life and work productivity. Currently there is no agreement on the best form of treatment for IBS. Therefore it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments, including homeopathic treatment, which some IBS sufferers use. Clinical homeopathy matches a 'remedy' to a specific condition (such as arnica for bruising), whereas individualised homeopathy involves a series of in-depth consultations to assess symptoms, the effects of remedies and other issues that may affect the patient, in order to select appropriate 'remedies'. Individualised homeopathy includes both a consultation and a remedy, whereas clinical homeopathy consists of a remedy without the in-depth consultation.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Do treatments that act on the immune system have effects on idiopathic lumbosacral plexopathy (ILSP)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Results
<ABS> After a wide search for high quality studies of treatment (randomized controlled trials, or similar), we found no trials in ILSP of any form of therapy that acts on the immune system or reduces inflammation. There is presently no evidence from any trial to show whether immunotherapies help people with ILSP.
<ABS> Database searches for this review were run on 15 October 2013.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Many children and adolescents worldwide are overweight or obese. Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese have increased physical disease and emotional distress. They also perform less well on tests of thinking (cognitive ability), and they do less well in school. To prevent and treat obesity, several lifestyle changes have been suggested, for example, being more physically active, eating fewer calories and sitting less. These interventions are known to improve thinking skills and school achievement in children of normal weight. It is unknown whether the effects are the same in overweight or obese children and adolescents.
<ABS> The review authors searched for studies that evaluated school achievement, cognitive ability and later life achievement (e.g. income, employment) in overweight or obese children and adolescents randomly assigned to a lifestyle intervention (aiming to being more physically active and/or improving diet and/or sitting less) or a control condition (e.g. standard care, no treatment). We found six relevant studies with a total of 674 overweight and obese children.
<ABS> We found that, compared with standard school routine, school-based interventions targeting healthy diet and lifestyle education led to small improvements in overall school achievement in overweight or obese children. We also found that increasing physical activity improved scores on tests of mathematics and memory, and improved 'problem-solving' thinking skills. No clear evidence was found of an effect on other thinking skills related to reading, language or vocabulary. We found no studies that looked at whether lifestyle interventions affected achievements after leaving school.
<ABS> Overall, despite the large number of childhood obesity treatment studies, only a select few evaluated the effects of obesity treatment on school achievement and cognitive function. The existing studies are limited in quality but suggest that lifestyle interventions could benefit overweight and obese children specifically in overall school achievement, mathematics, memory and specific thinking skills. Health policy makers may wish to consider these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment studies could consider academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Needlestick injuries (NSIs) from devices used for blood collection or for injections expose healthcare workers to the risk of serious infections such as hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Safety features such as shields or retractable needles can help prevent these injuries. We wanted to find out how effective these devices are. We searched for studies in multiple databases until January 2012 for randomised (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS).
<ABS> Studies included in this review
<ABS> We included eight RCTs and 11 NRS. These studies evaluated the safety of blood collection systems, intravenous (IV) systems, injection systems, multiple devices and sharps containers. We estimated that the NSI rate in the control groups was one to five NSIs per 1000 person-years. The risk of bias was high in most studies.
<ABS> What does the research say?
<ABS> In one NRS study that evaluated safe blood collection systems, NSIs decreased right after the systems were put into use but there was no further decrease over time.
<ABS> There was very low quality evidence that NSIs reduced significantly using safe IV devices. However, there was moderate quality evidence in four other studies that these devices increased the number of blood splashes where the user had to switch on the safety system.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence that safe injection devices reduced the NSI rate in two studies.
<ABS> Using many safety devices showed a decrease in NSI in one study but not in another. Using safety containers showed a decrease in NSI in one study but inconsistent results in two studies.
<ABS> There was no evidence in the included studies about which type of device was better. So, for example, we do not know if it is safer to shield or retract a needle.
<ABS> What is the bottom line?
<ABS> We concluded that there is only very low quality, inconsistent evidence that most safety devices prevent needlestick injuries (NSIs). The risk of blood contamination is greater with devices that have to be actively switched on. The lack of a clear beneficial effect could be due to the high risk of bias in the studies. This does not mean that these devices are not effective.
<ABS> Cluster-randomised studies are needed to compare the various types of safety devices for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs with 1136 participants, two cluster-RCTs with 795 participants and 73,454 patient days, four CBAs with approximately 22,000 participants and seven ITS with an average of seven data points. These studies evaluated safe modifications of blood collection systems, intravenous (IV) systems, injection systems, multiple devices and sharps containers. The needlestick injury (NSI) rate in the control groups was estimated at about one to five NSIs per 1000 person-years. There was only one study from a low- or middle-income country. The risk of bias was high in most studies.
<RES> In one ITS study that evaluated safe blood collection systems, NSIs decreased immediately after the introduction (effect size (ES) -6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.5 to -4.2) and there was no clear evidence of an additional benefit over time (ES -1.2, 95% CI -2.5 to 0.1). Another ITS study used an outdated recapping shield.
<RES> There was very low quality evidence that NSIs were reduced with the introduction of safe IV devices in two out of four studies but the other two studies showed no clear evidence of a trend towards a reduction. However, there was moderate quality evidence in four other studies that these devices increased the number of blood splashes where the safety system had to be engaged actively (relative risk (RR) 1.6, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.36).
<RES> There was no clear evidence that the introduction of safe injection devices changed the NSI rate in two studies.
<RES> The introduction of multiple safety devices showed a decrease in NSI in one study but not in another. The introduction of safety containers showed a decrease in NSI in one study but inconsistent results in two other studies.
<RES> There was no evidence in the included studies about which type of device was better, for example shielding or retraction of the needle.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Cluster-randomised controlled studies are needed to compare the various types of safety engineered devices for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low- and middle-income countries.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review found only one ongoing trial with no data available to date. There is thus no high quality evidence available as to whether or not hormonal contraception is associated with HIV acquisition. Because of the importance of hormonal contraception for women's health, no change in practice would be justified without such evidence. Appropriate randomised trials are needed to answer this important question.
<ABS> All women using non-barrier contraception should be advised that such contraception does not protect against HIV infection, and that they should take such precautions as are appropriate to their personal circumstances.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death in the world, and in people younger than 40 years of age, it is the leading cause of death. Since the 2000s, computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in the trauma bay. It is more sensitive and specific than conventional radiography and ultrasonography. By the 2010s, with technical and infrastructural improvements, CT has evolved into a reliable and important method of diagnostic imaging in trauma.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched medical databases for publications of randomised controlled trials (a clinical study where participants are randomly allocated into treatment groups) comparing the usual approach versus selected use of CT scanning. We included studies of all types of blunt trauma and excluded studies with people with penetrating injuries (e.g. gunshot or knife wounds) and pregnant women. The searches are up-to-date to May 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no published or ongoing randomised controlled trials that compared routine versus selective thoracoabdominal CT in blunt-trauma patients. At this time, it is not possible to say which approach is better for patients, or reduces death.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Optimal treatment of severe blunt pancreatic trauma in children has long been debated, some doctors advocate operation while others prefer a conservative approach without operation as primary treatment. We conducted this systematic review to assess which strategy should be preferred. Blunt trauma to the pancreas typically occurs after crashes involving a bicycle handlebar, road traffic crashes or other types of injury that cause a blow to the upper abdomen.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched medical databases for randomised (where two groups of children were randomly assigned to treatment or no treatment) clinical trials of children treated for blunt trauma to the pancreas by an operation or no operation. The children were aged 17 years or younger. The search was current to June 2013.
<ABS> Key results


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review aims to determine the current evidence on the impact of red blood cell transfusion on patients born with heart problems undergoing heart surgery.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Between four and nine children out of every 1000 born alive have hearts that have not formed properly. Heart surgery may allow a child to live and grow or may correct the defect in children and adults alike. Patients often need red blood cell transfusions during or after heart surgery. Most patients will have the surgery on a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine, which acts as the heart and lungs during the operation. More patients are now surviving heart surgery and the aim is to make surgery even safer. Some research suggests that red blood cell transfusions may make people more ill.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific sources to identify eligible trials and found 11 studies with 862 participants. We found no trials including adults. The identified studies examined three treatments: two trials compared giving a red blood cell transfusion only when the levels of haemoglobin in the blood fell below a certain concentration (known as a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion trigger); two trials compared whether there was a benefit to removing white blood cells (leukocytes) from the transfused red blood cells and seven trials compared methods used to prepare the fluid for the CPB machine. The trials were different in terms of the age of the participants, the type of heart disease and the exact treatment studied so there was been no opportunity to pool data for analysis. All studies did not report on all outcomes (a measure of a participant's clinical and functional status that is used to assess the effectiveness of a treatment, e.g. death, side effects).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Our primary outcome was death within 30 days after surgery. Five trials looked at this outcome and found no clear difference in mortality between the treatment arms. Four trials explored other adverse effects following a red blood cell transfusion. A difference in the number of adverse events was only observed for kidney failure: in one trial (with 309 participants), patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review identified only a few, small studies across three interventions. These studies measured many different aspects of red blood cell transfusion in patients having heart surgery so it is difficult to make accurate conclusions about the benefits or risks of red blood cell transfusion for these patients. More research is needed to allow accurate conclusions. Future studies should be bigger and focus on one aspect of transfusion in a specific type of heart disease.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 11 trials (862 participants). All trials were in neonatal or paediatric populations. The trials covered only three areas of interest: restrictive versus liberal transfusion triggers (two trials), leukoreduction versus non-leukoreduction (two trials) and standard versus non-standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime (seven trials). Owing to the clinical diversity in the participant groups (cyanotic (three trials), acyanotic (four trials) or mixed (four trials)) and the intervention groups, it was not appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis. No study reported data for all the outcomes of interest to this review. Risk of bias was mixed across the included trials, with only attrition bias being low across all trials. Blinding of study personnel and participants was not always possible, depending on the intervention being used.
<RES> Five trials (628 participants) reported the primary outcome: 30-day mortality. In three trials (a trial evaluating restrictive and liberal transfusion (125 participants), a trial of cell salvage during CPB (309 participants) and a trial of washed red blood cells during CPB (128 participants)), there was no clear difference in mortality at 30 days between the intervention arms. In two trials comparing standard and non-standard CPB prime, there were no deaths in either randomised group. Long-term mortality was similar between randomised groups in one trial each comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion or standard and non-standard CPB prime.
<RES> Four trials explored a range of adverse effects following red cell transfusion. Kidney failure was the only adverse event that was significantly different: patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.79, 1 study, 309 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between transfusion strategies for any other severe adverse events.
<RES> The duration of mechanical ventilation was measured in seven trials (768 participants). Overall, there was no consistent difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the intervention and control arms.
<RES> The duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was measured in six trials (459 participants). There was no clear difference in the duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms in the transfusion trigger and leukoreduction trials. In the standard versus non-standard CPB prime trials, one trial examining the impact of washing transfused bypass prime red blood cells showed no clear difference in duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms, while the trial assessing ultrafiltration of the priming blood showed a shorter duration of ICU stay in the ultrafiltration group.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Acute graft-versus-host disease is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplant of blood-forming stem cells). Immune cells (white blood cells) from the donor recognise the patient's cells as foreign ('non-self'). Therefore, the transplanted immune cells attack the cells of the patient. The main affected organs are skin, liver and gut among other organ tissues. These immune reactions may cause acute inflammation followed by chronic changes of the organs (e.g. fibrosis). First-line therapy usually consists of immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in refractory cases (where the disease is resistant to treatment). The use of these immunosuppressive drugs is designed to suppress the immune-mediated attack of the patient's cells. Limited effectiveness and severe side effects of these immunosuppressive drugs have led to the application of several alternative approaches.
<ABS> Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that involves collection of immune cells from peripheral blood outside the person's body. These immune cells are then exposed to a photoactive agent (a chemical that responds to exposure to light; e.g. 8-methoxypsoralen) with subsequent ultraviolet-A radiation and then re-infused. The immunomodulatory effects of this procedure have not been completely elucidated.
<ABS> Several current clinical practice recommendations suggest consideration of ECP in paediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease after HSCT.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of acute graft-versus-host disease in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) after HSCT.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found no RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for paediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease after HSCT. Current recommendations are based on retrospective (a study in which the outcomes have occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational (a study in which the investigators do not seek to intervene, and simply observed the course of events) studies only. We recommend the use of ECP in paediatric patients after HSCT only in the context of RCTs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Depression is a common mental disorder. It can present as loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of guilt or low self worth. In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that depression was the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years among all men and women between 15 and 44 years of age. The treatment of choice for severe and recurrent depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT involves the application of an electrical current to the patient's head. The aim is to induce a controlled convulsion. Patients usually undergo several sessions of ECT.
<ABS> To minimize adverse events and improve the quality of ECT, patients receive anaesthetic agents such as intravenous sedatives or hypnotics. These agents can influence the effectiveness of ECT but can cause potential adverse effects. It would be helpful to identify which is the best anaesthetic agent for ECT in this group of patients.
<ABS> This Cochrane review examined whether different types of anaesthetic agents could have an effect on anti-depression therapy and reported on the safety of those agents. The evidence is current to December 2012. We included in this review 18 randomized controlled trials (599 participants). We analysed nine pairs of comparisons: methohexital versus propofol; thiopental versus propofol; etomidate versus propofol; thiopental versus etomidate; etomidate versus methohexital; methohexital versus midazolam; thiopental versus midazolam; midazolam versus propofol; and thiamylal versus propofol.
<ABS> Our analysis revealed no difference in the reduction of depression scores when methohexital was compared with propofol. Propofol reduced seizure duration to a greater extent than methohexital. No difference in seizure duration was noted when thiopental was compared with propofol. Patients recovered faster from anaesthesia when propofol rather than thiopental was used. Adverse events related to anaesthesia induction agents and to the treatment for depression were not well reported in most trials. We found the quality of the evidence to be low. Larger well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed. More clinically relevant outcomes (such as remission of depressive symptoms and postanaesthetic adverse events) during a longer follow-up period should be reported in future studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included in the review 18 RCTs (599 participants; published between 1994 and 2012). Most of the included trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> We analysed the results of studies comparing six different intravenous anaesthetics.
<RES> Only a few studies comparing propofol with methohexital (four studies) and with thiopental (three studies) could be pooled.
<RES> No difference was noted in the reduction of depression scores observed in participants treated with propofol compared with methohexital (low-quality evidence). These four studies were not designed to detect differences in depression scores.
<RES> The duration of electroencephalograph (EEG) and of motor seizures was shorter in the propofol group compared with the methohexital group (low-quality evidence). No difference was seen in EEG seizure duration when propofol was compared with thiopental (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Time to recovery (following commands) was longer among participants after anaesthesia with thiopental compared with propofol (low-quality evidence).
<RES> For the remaining comparisons of anaesthetics, only single studies or insufficient data were available. Adverse events were inadequately reported in eligible trials, and none of the included trials reported anaesthesia-related mortality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Larger well-designed randomized studies are needed to determine which intravenous anaesthetic medication leads to the greatest improvement in depression scores with minimal adverse effects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is COPD?
<ABS> COPD is a common chronic respiratory disease mainly affecting people who smoke now or have done so previously. It could become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030. People with COPD experience gradually worsening shortness of breath and cough with sputum because of permanent damage to their airways and lungs. Those with COPD may have flare-ups (or exacerbations) that usually occur after respiratory infections. Exacerbations may lead to further irreversible loss of lung function with days off work, hospital admission, reduction in quality of life and they may even cause death.
<ABS> Why did we do this review?
<ABS> We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent a flare-up, 'prophylactic' antibiotics, would reduce the frequency of infections and improve quality of life. Studies that were taken into consideration used either continuous prophylactic antibiotics on a daily basis or prophylactic antibiotics that were used intermittently.
<ABS> What evidence did we find?
<ABS> We found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3170 patients. All studies were published between 2001 and 2011. Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis. The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin. On average, the people involved in the trials were 66 years old and had either moderate or severe COPD. Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two of the trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen.
<ABS> Results and conclusions
<ABS> We found that with the use of continuous daily antibiotics the number of patients who developed an exacerbation reduced markedly. For every eight patients treated, one person would be prevented from suffering an exacerbation. There may have been a benefit on patient-reported quality of life with the antibiotics. On the other hand, use of antibiotics did not significantly affect the number of deaths due to any cause, the frequency of hospitalisation, or the loss of lung function during the study period.
<ABS> Even though there may be fewer exacerbations with continuous antibiotics there are considerable drawbacks. First, there were specific adverse events associated with the antibiotics, which differed according to the antibiotic used; second, patients have to take antibiotics regularly for years or months; finally, the resulting increase in antibiotic resistance will have implications for both individual patients and the wider community through reducing the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics.
<ABS> Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven RCTs involving 3170 patients were included in this systematic review. All studies were published between 2001 and 2011. Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis (termed 'pulsed' for this review). The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin. Azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin are macrolides while moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. The study duration varied from three months to 36 months and all used intention-to-treat analysis. Most of the results were of moderate quality. The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low, and we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of bias.
<RES> The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 66 years and with at least a moderate severity of COPD. Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen.
<RES> The primary outcomes for this review were the number of exacerbations and quality of life.
<RES> With use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics the number of patients experiencing an exacerbation was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77, 3 studies, 1262 participants, high quality). This represented a reduction from 69% of participants in the control group compared to 54% in the treatment group (95% CI 46% to 63%) and the number needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation (NNTb) was therefore 8 (95% CI 5 to 18). The frequency of exacerbations was also reduced with continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment (rate ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91).
<RES> Use of pulsed antibiotic treatment showed a non-significant reduction in the number of people with exacerbations (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.09, 1 study, 1149 participants, moderate quality) and the test for interaction showed that this result was significantly different from the effect on exacerbations with continuous antibiotics.
<RES> There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life with both continuous and pulsed antibiotic treatment but this was smaller than the four unit improvement that is regarded as being clinically significant (MD -1.78; 95% CI -2.95 to -0.61, 2 studies, 1962 participants, moderate quality).
<RES> Neither pulsed nor continuous antibiotics showed a significant effect on the secondary outcomes of frequency of hospital admissions, change in lung function, serious adverse events or all-cause mortality (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The adverse events that were recorded varied among the trials depending on the different antibiotics used. Azithromycin was associated with a significant hearing loss in the treatment group. The moxifloxacin pulsed study reported a significantly higher number of adverse events in the treatment arm due to the marked increase in gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.001). Some adverse events that led to drug discontinuation, such as development of long QTc or tinnitus, were not significantly more frequent in the treatment group than the placebo group but pose important considerations in clinical practice.
<RES> The development of antibiotic resistance in the community is of major concern. One study found newly colonised patients to have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. Patients colonised with moxifloxacin-sensitive pseudomonas at initiation of therapy rapidly became resistant with the quinolone treatment.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics results in a clinically significant benefit in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients. All trials of continuous antibiotics used macrolides hence the noted benefit applies only to the use of continuous macrolide antibiotics. The impact of pulsed antibiotics remains uncertain and requires further research.
<CON> The trials in this review included patients who were frequent exacerbators and needed treatment with antibiotics or systemic steroids, or who were on supplemental oxygen. There were also older individuals with a mean age of 66 years. The results of these trials apply only to the group of patients who were studied in these trials and may not be generalisable to other groups.
<CON> Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Beclometasone for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; i.e. chronic bronchitis or emphysema or both, also called "smoker's lung disease") is a disease in which patients (predominantly smokers) experience breathlessness and produce a lot of phlegm or sputum. COPD is diagnosed by using international guidelines provided by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).
<ABS> One of the treatments that may be used to slow down worsening of this disease consists of steroid inhalers. These inhalers are known as preventer inhalers because they are taken daily to prevent symptoms. GOLD recommends that steroid inhalers are now to be used only in combination with inhaled LABA drugs (long-acting beta2-agonists, e.g. formoterol). They are recommended for patients who have COPD with high risk of flare-ups ("exacerbations").
<ABS> Why do this review?
<ABS> It is still unsure whether these steroid preventer inhalers, such as beclometasone inhalers, make a difference to patients with COPD.
<ABS> Therefore we decided to do a systematic review of existing studies to look into the effects and side effects of beclometasone inhalers for people with COPD.
<ABS> Which questions does this review try to answer?
<ABS> Our study consisted of two parts: (A) Are beclometasone inhalers better than placebo? and (B) Is beclometasone in combination with LABA drugs in one inhaler (a beclometasone/formoterol combination inhaler) better than a LABA (formoterol) inhaler?
<ABS> How did this review do this?
<ABS> We searched all research papers of clinical trials on this topic and made a special effort to find unpublished trials.
<ABS> We compared effects on breathing ability, death rates, how often pneumonias and flare-ups happened, how often rescue inhalers had to be used, quality of life and side effects.
<ABS> The evidence obtained is up to date to February 2013.
<ABS> What were the results?
<ABS> For (A) we found two studies, with a total of 298 study participants. For (B) we found one study, with 474 study participants, all with severe (stage 3) COPD.
<ABS> For (A) we found no differences that could not be due to chance (not "statistically significant"). Therefore we found no evidence that beclometasone is better or worse than placebo for COPD. It is possible that this conclusion is not fully informed, however, as we were able to use only one trial. We await further statistics from another trial, and we suspect that many trials addressing (A) have gone unpublished in the past.
<ABS> For (B) we found real differences in breathing capacity and rescue inhalers ("statistically significant"), but as the differences were small, they are unlikely to be noticeable for patients (not "clinically significant"). We also found a real increase in the average rate of severe flare-ups of COPD requiring hospital admission when study participants were using steroid-containing inhalers. However, the trial authors showed that these differences could have been caused by different hospital policies in the many countries that participated. For the other aspects that we compared, we found no differences in benefits or harms; any differences found were so small that they could have been due to chance. Further research is being done in this area, and findings of these studies may change our conclusions in the future.
<ABS> Are there any criticisms of this review's results?
<ABS> Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that were useful (only three), the poor/average quality of the evidence and the fact that most of these studies apply only to patients with severe but very stable COPD.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic obstructive lung condition, diagnosed in patients with dyspnoea, chronic cough or sputum production and/or a history of risk factor exposure, if their postbronchodilator forced expiratory lung volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital lung capacity (FVC) ratio is less than 0.70, according to the international GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria.
<INT> Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medications are now recommended for COPD only in combination treatment with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), and only for patients of GOLD stage 3 and stage 4 severity, for both GOLD groups C and D.
<INT> ICS are expensive and how effective they are is a topic of controversy, particularly in relation to their adverse effects (pneumonia), which may be linked to more potent ICS. It is unclear whether beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), an unlicensed but widely used inhaled steroid, is a safe and effective alternative to other ICS.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> For BDP versus placebo, two studies were included, of which one trial (participants n = 194) was included in the quantitative analysis. This study was a very high-dose trial with stable stage 2 and 3 COPD participants. No statistically significant results in change in lung function, mortality, exacerbations, dyspnoea scores or withdrawal were obtained. The quality of the evidence of all these outcomes was graded low to very low. Data on risk of pneumonia were lacking.
<RES> The main focus of the review was the more clinically relevant BDP/LABA versus LABA arm. Therefore the findings are reported more fully.

<H1> Implementation of treatment guidelines in mental health care

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> One method of encouraging better uptake is the use of treatment guidelines based on assessments of research evidence. Treatment guidelines are now commonly employed in healthcare settings, including those providing treatment for schizophrenia. It remains unclear, however, whether treatment guidelines have any positive impact on the performance of mental health services or whether they improve outcomes for patients (such as better quality of life, improved mental state, employment and fewer admissions to hospital).

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anaesthetic regimens for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 11 trials involving 1069 patients in this review. Most participants in the trials had a low anaesthetic risk.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths or serious complications in the only trial that reported this information. Overall, 85% of patients (472/554) were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients and 2% of patients (1/60) required hospital readmission. The reasons for not discharging the patients as day-procedure patients were not described in detail in the trials. The reason for readmission was fever that developed in the patient and which subsequently settled on its own without any treatment. Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the measures of pain intensity between any of the comparisons. Time to return to routine daily activity and to return to work were not reported in any of the trials. There is currently no evidence to support one anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy over another.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All the trials had elements that tended to reduce our trust in the accuracy of the results. Few patients were included in each comparison resulting in a considerable chance of arriving at erroneous conclusions.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Randomized controlled trials designed to minimize the risk of arriving at wrong conclusions are necessary to determine the best anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of the commonest procedures performed in the western world.

<H1> Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of research about the effects of cognitive-behavioural therapies (CBTs) on fibromyalgia (FM). After searching for all relevant studies, they found 23 studies with up to 2031 people. Their findings are summarised below.
<ABS> After about 12 weeks, children, adolescents and adults with FMS, who used CBTs compared to controls, were likely to report that CBT
<ABS> - may reduce slightly pain, negative mood and disability at the end of the treatment;
<ABS> - may reduce slightly pain, negative mood and disability six months after the end of treatment.
<ABS> There was no difference between CBTs and controls in the number of people who withdrew from treatment.
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of CBTs. Rare complications may include worsening of co-existing mental disorders.
<ABS> What is fibromyalgia and what are cognitive behavioural therapies?
<ABS> People with FM suffer from chronic widespread pain, sleep problems and fatigue. There is no cure for FM at present, so treatments aim to relieve symptoms and to improve daily functioning.
<ABS> Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) are widely used psychological treatments for a wide range of health problems, including chronic pain. CBTs are effective in enhancing patients’ beliefs in their own abilities and developing ways to deal with health problems. The primary goals of CBTs are to change negative thoughts and feelings that individuals may have of their physical and mental problems and to change their behaviour accordingly. Patients learn skills (for example, relaxation, activity pacing) to help them to manage their pain better or develop different attitudes towards pain (for example, more acceptance), or both.
<ABS> Best estimates of what happens to people with FMS when they use CBTs
<ABS> Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their pain to be 0.5 points lower at the end of treatment (6.3% absolute improvement) and to be 0.6 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (4.2% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rates their pain to be 6.9 points on a scale of 0-10.
<ABS> - People who used a control treatment rated their pain to be 7.4 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Negative mood (higher scores mean worse or more severe negative mood):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their depressed mood to be 0.7 points lower at the end of treatment (10.2% absolute improvement) and to be 1.3 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (2.7% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their negative mood to be 6.1 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who had a control treatment rated their negative mood to be 6.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Disability (higher scores mean more disability):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their disability to be 0.7 points lower at the end of treatment (7.2% absolute improvement) and to be 1.2 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (11.7% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - Peope who used CBTs rated their disability to be 2.0 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who used a control treatment rated their disability to be 2.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Withdrawing from treatment:
<ABS> - The number of people who withdrew from CBTs compared to control interventions due to any reason was equal.
<ABS> - 15 people out of 100 who used CBTs withdrew from treatment due to any reason;
<ABS> - 15 people out of 100 who used control interventions withdrew from treatment due to any reason.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist that can cause sedation, anxiolysis, analgesic sparing, reduced salivary secretion and minimal respiratory depression; this might be beneficial for patients with a difficult or unstable airway undergoing AFOI.
<ABS> We searched the medical literature until May 2012 and identified four randomized controlled trials involving 211 patients that were appropriate for inclusion in the review. These studies compared dexmedetomidine versus midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo for patients undergoing AFOI. We reran our search in November 2013, and four studies are awaiting assessment. We will deal with them when we update the review.
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced patient discomfort during AFOI compared with control groups in two included trials. No significant differences in intubation time, airway obstruction, low oxygen levels or treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events were reported during AFOI between the dexmedetomidine group and the control group.
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine did not appear to be inferior to other medications. The data from this evidence database of modest size provide limited evidence to support the use of dexmedetomidine as an alternative or primary choice for AFOI. Further research should focus on this important topic. Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to test the exact benefits of dexmedetomidine in the management of AFOI.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatments for fingertip entrapment injuries in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fingertip entrapment injuries commonly happen in children when their fingertip is caught between the door and the door surround as the door closes. This damages the finger nail, surrounding tissue and bone, all of which are important structures in the protection of the fingertip and for nail growth. These injuries are also called trapped finger injuries, crush fingertip injuries or door jamb injuries.
<ABS> Sometimes these injuries are treated without surgery ('conservatively') by cleaning them and dressing the wound. Alternatively, the injuries are treated with surgery, which typically involves a general anaesthetic, cleaning of the wound and removal of damaged tissue, and stitches to repair any cuts on the fingertip or the nail.
<ABS> We searched the medical literature until 30 April 2013 for studies comparing different methods of treating fingertip entrapment injuries. Our review includes evidence from two studies where participants were randomly allocated to one of two conditions. The studies included 191 children with results available for a total of 180 children. Both the studies had weaknesses that could undermine the reliability of the results. Since the studies compared different methods, we could not combine their results.
<ABS> One study looked at the routine use of antibiotics in children with a surgically repaired fingertip injury to prevent infection. Due to the small number of children experiencing infection this study does not provide conclusive evidence of the effect of giving or withholding antibiotics. Only one child in each group had an infection after a week. Both children had had more severe injuries.
<ABS> The other study compared two different dressing types for use in fingertip entrapment injuries. The low number of complications was comparable in the two treatment groups. Due to the low number of participants in the study we could not be certain that length of time the injuries took to heal and the number of dressing changes were the same in the treatment groups. However, it also found that the dressing made of silicone caused less distress for the child when being changed after the first week, probably because it stuck less to the wound than the paraffin dressing.
<ABS> Overall, there is not enough evidence about how to best treat fingertip entrapment injuries in children. We recommend that further research is carried out, especially to see if surgery leads to better outcomes than simple wound cleaning and dressing. These studies should evaluate the effect of the treatment on fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months after treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two RCTs examining a total of 191 young children, 180 of whom were included in the analyses. The two trials tested different comparisons. Both trials were at high risk of bias, particularly from lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and of outcome assessment. The trials did not record fingertip function, nail growth or nail deformity. The quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes was judged to be 'low' using the GRADE approach (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate).
<RES> One trial compared a seven-day course of antibiotics with no antibiotics after formal surgical repair of fingertip entrapment injuries. One child in each group had an infection at day seven (1/66 antibiotic group versus 1/69 no antibiotic group; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.37). Both participants with infections had a more severe injury (partial fingertip amputation).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is a lack of evidence from RCTs to inform all key treatment decisions for the management of fingertip entrapment injuries in children.
<CON> Given that the quality of evidence is low from one trial, we do not have conclusive evidence that prophylactic use of antibiotics after surgical repair fails to reduce risk of infection. The two children who experienced infection had more severe wounds.
<CON> Similarly, the low quality evidence from one trial has not enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect on healing time or complications (infection, skin necrosis) at four-week follow-up between a silicone net dressing and a paraffin gauze dressing when applied post-surgery or after simple wound irrigation; however, the silicone net dressing may be easier to remove in the first week.
<CON> Further RCTs are required in this area, preferably comparing surgical with conservative methods of managing fingertip entrapment injuries. Outcome assessment should include fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months post treatment.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV-1 infection

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> After initially screening 920 titles, 15 full-text articles were closely examined by two authors. We identified four cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria for data extraction, coding, and potential meta-analysis.
<RES> Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias assessments, all observational studies had cohorts that were representative of average (treated and untreated) HIV-infected children with Kaposi sarcoma. For all outcomes of interest, no study adjusted for any other potential confounders. Two of four observational studies either explicitly described complete follow up of the study participants and/or described the characteristics of the participants lost to follow up.
<RES> The use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus ART alone appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS, although data are sparse and not adequately adjusted for staging of disease and comorbidities. Additionally, though data are sparse, the use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus chemotherapy alone in some analyses appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission and reduce the risk of death in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS.
<RES> In this analysis, we found that the quality of evidence was very low due to small sample sizes and a paucity of paediatric literature.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review to evaluate the effect of approaches to encourage health workers to work in particular healthcare facilities. After searching for all relevant studies, they were unable to find any studies that met their requirements for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Although these types of approaches are not uncommon, the review could not find any relevant studies that gave a reliable assessment of their impact. There is still a lot of work to be done to understand how governments can ensure that health workers serve in those health facilities that care for the majority of the population.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in supporting children's breathing. We found 11 studies in children.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> HFNC therapy delivers a mixture of air and oxygen via tubing that sits just inside the nostrils. For children hospitalized with breathing difficulties caused by conditions such as pneumonia or trauma or after surgery, HFNC therapy may help to support their breathing. This may reduce the need for other forms of breathing support such as life support. HFNC therapy can be used within the hospital ward setting, the emergency department or the intensive care unit. This Cochrane review is important because it assesses available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of HFNC compared with other forms of respiratory support, to help inform clinicians caring for children with breathing difficulties.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> We searched medical databases from the 1950s until April 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included studies on children from four weeks to 16 years of age. We searched for randomized controlled trials; however we excluded studies involving infants with bronchiolitis (a respiratory illness affecting infants that typically mimics a common cold) because children with this condition are included in another Cochrane review.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found 11 studies involving children; however none matched our criteria.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> It is important that good-quality studies are completed to identify indications as to the use and effectiveness of HFNC therapy in supporting the breathing of ill children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The main methods for remunerating primary care dentists include:
<ABS> 2. fixed salary payment (a lump sum payment made to a dentist for a set number of working hours or sessions per week);
<ABS> 3. capitation payment (a payment based on the number and types of patients whose care the dentist takes responsibility for); and
<ABS> 4. blended payment (combination of above).
<ABS> There was insufficient information regarding cost-effectiveness of the different remuneration methods.
<ABS> Financial incentives within remuneration systems may produce changes to clinical activity undertaken by primary care dentists. However, the number of included studies is limited and the quality of the evidence is low/very low for all outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two cluster-RCTs, with data from 503 dental practices, representing 821 dentists and 4771 patients, met the selection criteria. We judged the risk of bias to be high for both studies and the overall quality of the evidence was low/very low for all outcomes, as assessed using the GRADE approach.
<RES> There was insufficient information regarding the cost-effectiveness of the different remuneration methods.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to evaluate the effects of interdental (between the teeth) brushing in addition to toothbrushing as compared with toothbrushing on its own or toothbrushing plus flossing for the prevention and control of periodontal (gum) diseases, dental plaque (a sticky film containing bacteria) and dental caries (tooth decay).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Gum disease and tooth decay are the main reasons for tooth loss. Unless brushed away, plaque can build up on the teeth. A build up of plaque can lead to gum inflammation and gum disease and is also a key factor in the development of tooth decay.
<ABS> Conventional toothbrushing alone is not very effective at removing plaque between teeth. Dental floss has been used for many years together with toothbrushing for removing dental plaque in between teeth. However, recently, interdental brushes to use between the teeth have been developed and many people find them easier to use than floss. If interdental brushes are to be used there must be enough space between the teeth to enable this.
<ABS> Interdental brushes are small-headed toothbrushes available in a range of different widths to match the space between teeth. They can be cone shaped or cylindrical. Brushes for use for cleaning around implants have coated wire to avoid scratching them or causing a shock.
<ABS> Together with dental floss interdental brushes are one of the most commonly recommended, advertised and available aids for cleaning between the teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 7 March 2013. Seven studies with a total of 354 participants were included in this review. Participants were aged 16 years and over and had teeth. In terms of deciding which studies to include in this review there was no distinction made on the basis of race, gender, jobs (socioeconomic status), place, background exposure to fluoride, initial health status, setting or time of the intervention. Studies were excluded from the review if the majority of participants had any orthodontic appliances (braces), if participants were selected on the basis of special health conditions or if the majority of participants had severe gum disease.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is some very low-quality evidence that using interdental brushes plus toothbrushing is more beneficial than toothbrushing alone for plaque and gingivitis at one month. There is also low-quality evidence that using interdental brushes reduces gingivitis (gum inflammation) by 52% when compared with flossing at one month. There was insufficient evidence to claim a benefit for either interdental brushing or flossing for plaque.
<ABS> None of the studies reported on tooth decay as none were long enough for the changes brought about by early tooth decay between teeth to be detected or found. Three studies reported that no adverse effects or harms were observed or reported during the study. Two other studies provided some data on adverse effects/harms/problems ranging from difficulties manipulating floss, reaching back teeth, interdental brushes distorting and buckling and also (noted to be the most serious) the fact that floss can make gums sore, however we could not formally analyse the data as studies did not provide enough detail. Two studies did not report whether adverse events occurred.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the only study to compare toothbrushing with interdental brushing and toothbrushing alone was assessed as being very low. The quality of evidence for the comparison between interdental brushing and flossing both in addition to toothbrushing was low. No studies reported the development of tooth decay.   

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There were seven studies (total 354 participants analysed) included in this review. We assessed one study as being low, three studies as being high and three studies as being at unclear risk of bias. Studies only reported the clinical outcome gingivitis and plaque data, with no studies providing data on many of the outcomes: periodontitis, caries, halitosis and quality of life. Three studies reported that no adverse events were observed or reported during the study. Two other studies provided some data on adverse events but we were unable to pool the data due to lack of detail. Two studies did not report whether adverse events occurred.
<RES> Interdental brushing in addition to toothbrushing, as compared with toothbrushing alone
<RES> Only one high risk of bias study (62 participants in analysis) looked at this comparison and there was very low-quality evidence for a reduction in gingivitis (0 to 4 scale, mean in control): mean difference (MD) 0.53 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.83) and plaque (0 to 5 scale): MD 0.95 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.34) at one month, favouring of use of interdental brushes. This represents a 34% reduction in gingivitis and a 32% reduction in plaque.
<RES> Interdental brushing in addition to toothbrushing, as compared with toothbrushing and flossing
<RES> Seven studies provided data showing a reduction in gingivitis in favour of interdental brushing at one month: SMD -0.53 (95% CI -0.81 to -0.24, seven studies, 326 participants, low-quality evidence). This translates to a 52% reduction in gingivitis (Eastman Bleeding Index). Although a high effect size in the same direction was observed at three months (SMD -1.98, 95% CI -5.42 to 1.47, two studies, 107 participants, very low quality), the confidence interval was wide and did not exclude the possibility of no difference. There was insufficient evidence to claim a benefit for either interdental brushing or flossing for reducing plaque (SMD at one month 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.33, seven studies, 326 participants, low-quality evidence) and insufficient evidence at three months (SMD -2.14, 95% CI -5.25 to 0.97, two studies, 107 participants very low-quality evidence).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE until 2013. We found nine randomised controlled trials of two-drug through to five-drug fixed-dose combination therapy with placebo, single drug active component, or usual care in 7047 patients, dating from 2009 to 2013. Trials were generally short-term, ranging from six weeks to 15 months, and included middle-age adults with and without prior CVD.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: dose-response effects on growth

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Asthma guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first choice of treatment for children with persistent asthma that is not well controlled when only a reliever inhaler is used to treat symptoms. Steroids work by reducing inflammation in the lungs and are known to control underlying symptoms of asthma. However, parents and physicians remain concerned about the potential negative effect of ICS on growth.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Does altering the dose of inhaled corticosteroids make a difference in the growth of children with asthma?
<ABS> What evidence did we find?
<ABS> We studied whether a difference could be seen in the growth of children with persistent asthma who were using different doses of the same ICS molecule and the same delivery device. We found 22 eligible trials, but only 10 of them measured growth or other measures of interest. Overall, 3394 children included in the review combined 17 group comparisons (i.e. 17 groups of children with mild to moderate asthma using a particular dose and type of steroid in 10 trials). Trials used different ICS molecules (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone or mometasone) either on their own or in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist (a drug used to open up the airways) and generally compared low doses of corticosteroids (50 to 100 μg) with low to medium (200 μg) doses of corticosteroids (converted in μg HFA-beclomethasone equivalent) over 12 to 52 weeks.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found a small but statistically significant group difference in growth over 12 months between these different doses clearly favouring the lower dose of ICS. The type of corticosteroid among newer molecules (ciclesonide, fluticasone, mometasone) did not seem to influence the impact on growth over one year. Differences in corticosteroid doses did not seem to affect the change in height, the gain in weight, the gain in bone mass index and the maturation of bones.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review is based on a small number of trials that reported data and were conducted on children with mild to moderate asthma. Only 10 of 22 studies measured the few outcomes of interest for this review, and only four comparisons reported growth over 12 months. Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high for this outcome, however it is low to moderate for several other outcomes, depending on the number of trials reporting these outcomes. Moreover, a few outcomes were reported only by a single trial; as these findings have not been confirmed by other trials, we downgraded the evidence for these outcomes to low quality. An insufficient number of trials have compared the effect of a larger difference in dose, for example, between a high dose and a low dose of ICS and of other popular molecules such as budesonide and beclomethasone over a year or longer of treatment.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We report an evidence-based ICS dose–dependent reduction in growth velocity in prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma. The choice of ICS molecule (mometasone, ciclesonide or fluticasone) was not found to affect the level of growth velocity response over a year. The effect of corticosteroids on growth was not consistently reported: among 22 eligible trials, only four comparisons reported the effects of corticosteroids on growth over one year. In view of parents' and clinicians' concerns, lack of or incomplete reporting of growth is a matter of concern given the importance of the topic. We recommend that growth be systematically reported in all trials involving children taking ICS for three months or longer. Until further data comparing low versus high ICS dose and trials of longer duration are available, we recommend that the minimal effective ICS dose be used in all children with asthma.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) with vitamin K antagonists in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent stroke.
<ABS> Background: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that arises in a heart with normal valves. It increases the risk of developing blood clots in the heart which can then travel to the brain, leading to a stroke, and to other parts of the body. Warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) is a drug that prevents the formation of such clots, thus reducing the risk of stroke. However, the need for frequent blood tests to adjust the dose and the risk of bleeding limits the use of warfarin. The oral DTIs represent a potential alternative. We aimed to establish the comparative effectiveness and safety of these new drugs compared with the standard treatment (warfarin) used for long-term anticoagulation in people with AF.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included eight studies, identified up to October 2013, evaluating the effect of DTIs versus warfarin in people with non-valvular AF. DTIs included were dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily (three studies, 12,355 participants), AZD0837 300 mg once a day (two studies, 233 participants) and ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily (three studies, 3726 participants). Of the total number of participants included in this review 61% were men, and the mean age of participants in all studies was over 70 years. Follow-up periods after the end of study medication ranged from zero to four weeks.
<ABS> Key results: We conducted the analyses excluding ximelagatran because this drug was withdrawn from the market owing to toxic effects on the liver. We evaluated the effectiveness of the treatment by the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events. We evaluated safety by the number of (1) fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events, including haemorrhagic strokes, (2) adverse events other than bleeding and ischaemic events that led to treatment discontinuation, and (3) death from all causes.
<ABS> There was no difference in the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events between all DTIs combined and warfarin, although dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin for this outcome. Major bleeding events were less frequent with the DTIs, making them a potentially safer alternative to anticoagulation in people at high risk. The adverse events that led participants to discontinue treatment were more frequent with the DTIs. Death from all causes was similar between DTIs and warfarin.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: We judged the quality of all eight included studies to be adequate to address the main objectives of the review.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Searches of all relevant sources of medical information identified 7558 articles, and, after initial screening of all these articles, we selected 45 as being suitable for this review. On reading the summaries of these 45 trials, 10 were suitable to be included in this review. We included trials that looked at the effects of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over having radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Results showed that studies evaluating dietary changes, including changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose, during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment. However, these dietary changes did not seem to improve patients' weights.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> While some changes to diet during radiotherapy may benefit patients by reducing diarrhoea, it is important to recognise that some of the studies reviewed were dated and there have been changes in radiotherapy technique since then that may give patients less diarrhoea anyway. In addition, many studies were of poor quality and, therefore, only a small number were able to be included in this review. Some interventions described, for example, having to take a liquid diet, were not acceptable as many patients found them difficult to tolerate and were unable to take them completely.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of chronic graft-versus-host disease in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) after HSCT.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wanted to find out the effects of extra insulation on preventing hypothermia and its complications for adults having an operation.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People can get cold during operations, particularly because of the drugs used as anaesthetics. This can sometimes cause potentially dangerous heart problems. The cold can also make people shiver and feel uncomfortable after an operation. Ways have therefore been developed to try to keep people warm during an operation. One way is to use reflective blankets or clothing as extra insulation.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We looked at studies comparing what happened when using reflective blankets or clothing against what happened when someone had normal care, using non-reflective blankets or clothing.
<ABS> We also looked at studies comparing what happened when using a machine to force warm air through the person’s blankets (forced air warming) against what happened when using reflective blankets or clothing.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is no clear evidence that using reflective blankets or clothing increases a person’s temperature compared with what happens when someone has usual care.
<ABS> There is some evidence that using forced air warming increases a person’s temperature compared with what happens when using reflective blankets or clothing. The temperature increase was between 0.5 ºC and 1 ºC. It is unclear how this temperature difference would reduce the consequences of coldness, with uncertain effects on blood loss, shivering and time spent in recovery. We were unable to find sufficient information to look at adverse effects of insulation or warming, or major events affecting the heart or circulatory system.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most of the evidence was low quality. We were particularly concerned about the potential for skewed results from operating theatre staff changing their behaviour when they knew ways of keeping the patient warm had changed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review questions
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence to see whether allowing for low blood oxygen levels, as opposed to normal blood oxygen levels, in severely ill people on mechanical breathing machines (ventilators) in intensive care units (ICUs) (otherwise known as critical care units (CCUs)) changed their chances of recovery (morbidity) and survival rate (mortality). We found no studies eligible for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We were looking for studies that assessed the morbidity and mortality of ventilated people who were at least one year old. We were looking for studies in which the intention in one group of people was to maintain low levels of blood oxygen, and the intention in the other group of people was to maintain normal levels of blood oxygen. We included studies involving people irrespective of gender, ethnicity and past medical history. The evidence is current to November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Our search yielded 2419 results. After exclusion of duplications, 1651 candidate studies were identified. Upon assessing the titles and abstracts of candidate studies, we found that none met our inclusion criteria. We are therefore unable to identify or comment as to whether allowing for low blood oxygen levels is beneficial.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> As no studies were included in our review, we cannot comment on the quality of evidence. Given the lack of evidence related to safety issues regarding allowing for low, as opposed to normal, levels of blood oxygen, we recommend caution with respect to changing current medical practice in this area. We do believe however that future research into this question is necessary.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This comprehensive review failed to identify any relevant studies evaluating permissive hypoxaemia versus normoxaemia in mechanically ventilated critically ill participants. Therefore we are unable to support or refute the hypothesis that this treatment strategy is of benefit to patients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver produces bile, which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat. The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver in the abdomen (belly) before it reaches the small bowel. Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones. Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult western population. Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic in one year. The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin-secreting cells that maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis). Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones. This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy). Generally, before being operated on, patients will be given informal information by the healthcare providers involved in the care of the patients (doctors, nurses, ward clerks, or healthcare assistants). This information is likely to include some information on the type of anaesthesia, expected duration of surgery, expected outcome of surgery including the complications, duration of hospital stay, wound dressing care (if applicable), return to normal activity, and return to work. This information can also be provided formally in different formats including written information, formal lectures, video, or computer presentations. The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to provide formal information to the patients before the operation.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the medical literature in order to identify studies that provided information on the above question. The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well. Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information. The information is current to March 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found four trials including 431 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who received either formal patient education (215 participants) or standard care (216 participants). The choice of whether the patient received formal patient education or standard care was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin in order to create comparable groups of patients. The patient education included providing information by just talking to the patient but in a more formal way or by using various method of presentation. All the trials were of high risk of bias (faults in study design that can result in erroneous conclusions). Only one trial including 212 participants reported deaths after surgery. There were no deaths in either group in this trial. There was no clear evidence of an effect on pain scores at 9 to 24 hours, patient knowledge, patient satisfaction, or patient anxiety associated with education. None of the trials reported surgical complications, quality of life, percentage of patients discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, return to work, or the number of unplanned visits to the doctor.
<ABS> A total of 173 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent patient education with repeat-back (patients repeating back the information provided) (92 participants) or patient education without repeat-back (81 participants) in one trial of high risk of bias. The only outcome reported in this trial was patient knowledge. The results we found for the effect onpatient knowledge between the patient education with repeat-back and patient education without repeat-back groups were uncertain and we could not exclude possible benefits of either education or control.
<ABS> Due to the very low quality of the current evidence, we are uncertain as to whether formal patient education provided in addition to the standard information provided by doctors has any benefit to patients. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence was very low.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2013), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to March 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 173 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to electronic consent with repeat-back (patients repeating back the information provided) (92 participants) versus electronic consent without repeat-back (81 participants) in one trial of high risk of bias. The only outcome reported in this trial was patient knowledge. The effect on patient knowledge between the patient education with repeat-back versus patient education without repeat-back groups was imprecise and based on 1 trial of 173 participants; SMD 0.07; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.37; very low quality evidence).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Total knee replacement is a common and often painful orthopaedic operation. Femoral nerve block (FNB) is an analgesic technique that blocks sensation to the knee to reduce pain following surgery. FNB is given as a single injection or as continuous infusion of numbing medication in the groin area.
<ABS> This review compared FNB with other common analgesic techniques (patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids, epidural analgesia, local infiltration analgesia and oral analgesia). A total of 45 randomised trials with 2710 participants were included. Among the included studies, 30 treatment groups compared FNB with PCA opioids, 10 compared FNB with epidural analgesia, five compared FNB with local infiltration analgesia, one compared FNB with oral analgesia and four compared continuous FNB with single-injection FNB. The average methodological quality of the included studies was moderate.
<ABS> FNB (any type) resulted in less pain at rest and on movement during the first 72 hours after surgery, compared with PCA opioid alone. FNB also resulted in lower opioid consumption, fewer patients with nausea and vomiting, greater knee flexion and higher patient satisfaction, compared with PCA opioid. Additionally, continuous FNB provided better pain relief than was attained with single-injection FNB.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 45 eligible RCTs (2710 participants) from 47 publications; 20 RCTs had more than two allocation groups. A total of 29 RCTs compared FNB (with or without concurrent treatments including PCA opioid) versus PCA opioid, 10 RCTs compared FNB versus epidural, five RCTs compared FNB versus local infiltration analgesia, one RCT compared FNB versus oral analgesia and four RCTs compared continuous versus single-shot FNB. Most included RCTs were rated as low or unclear risk of bias for the aspects rated in the risk of bias assessment tool, except for the aspect of blinding. We rated 14 (31%) RCTs at high risk for both participant and assessor blinding and rated eight (18%) RCTs at high risk for one blinding aspect.
<RES> We could not demonstrate a difference in pain between FNB (any type) and epidural analgesia in the first 72 hours post operation, including pain at 24 hours at rest (six RCTs, 328 participants, SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.32, moderate-quality evidence) and on movement (six RCTs, 317 participants, SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.24, high-quality evidence). No difference was noted at 24 hours for opioid consumption (five RCTs, 341 participants, MD -4.35 mg, 95% CI -9.95 to 1.26 mg, high-quality evidence) or knee flexion (six RCTs, 328 participants, MD -1.65, 95% CI -5.14 to 1.84, high-quality evidence). However, FNB demonstrated lower risk of nausea/vomiting (four RCTs, 183 participants, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97, NNTH 8, moderate-quality evidence) and higher patient satisfaction (two RCTs, 120 participants, SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97, low-quality evidence), compared with epidural analgesia.
<RES> Pooled results of four studies (216 participants) comparing FNB with local infiltration analgesia detected no difference in analgesic effects between the groups at 24 hours for pain at rest (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) or pain on movement (SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.86, low-quality evidence). Only one included RCT compared FNB with oral analgesia. We considered this evidence insufficient to allow judgement of the effects of FNB compared with oral analgesia.
<RES> Continuous FNB provided less pain compared with single-shot FNB (four RCTs, 272 participants) at 24 hours at rest (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.07, moderate-quality evidence) and on movement (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.17, high-quality evidence). Continuous FNB also demonstrated lower opioid consumption compared with single-shot FNB at 24 hours (three RCTs, 236 participants, MD -13.81 mg, 95% CI -23.27 to -4.35 mg, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Generally, the meta-analyses demonstrated considerable statistical heterogeneity, with type of FNB, allocation concealment and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors reducing heterogeneity in the analyses. Available evidence was insufficient to allow determination of the comparative safety of the various analgesic techniques. Few RCTs reported on serious adverse effects such as neurological injury, postoperative falls or thrombotic events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> What does the research say?
<ABS> We searched for studies in which people who had been in contact with scabies-infected people had been given medical treatment, or had been advised about personal hygiene to prevent the scabies infection from spreading. We also wanted studies to have been designed so that the treatment received by participants (either medication or advice) was determined by chance. We did not find any studies fulfilling these criteria.
<ABS> Conclusions


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review does not provide enough evidence to say whether or not treatments for pain in people with GBS work. Although both gabapentin and carbamazepine reduced the severity of pain compared to placebo, and few side effects were reported, the studies were small and the quality of the evidence was very low. Much larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm that drug treatments are safe and effective for people with pain in the period soon after onset of GBS. Long-term studies of pain treatments at the stage when people with GBS are recovering should also be conducted and these should include assessment of effects of pain treatments on quality of life.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven reports (relating to five possible trials) were found. We included one study (six trial reports) involving 256 women. Four other studies are ongoing.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three RCTs and one economic study representing a total of 502 randomised participants from acute and long-term care settings. Two trials compared the 30º and 90º tilt positions using similar repositioning frequencies (there was a small difference in frequency of overnight repositioning in the 90º tilt groups between the trials). The third RCT compared alternative repositioning frequencies.
<RES> All three studies reported the proportion of patients developing PU of any grade, stage or category. None of the trials reported on pain, or quality of life, and only one reported on cost. All three trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> The two trials of 30º tilt vs. 90º were pooled using a random effects model (I² = 69%) (252 participants). The risk ratio for developing a PU in the 30º tilt and the standard 90º position was very imprecise (pooled RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.97, P=0.62, very low quality evidence). This comparison is underpowered and at risk of a Type 2 error (only 21 events).
<RES> In the third study, a cluster randomised trial, participants were randomised between 2-hourly and 3-hourly repositioning on standard hospital mattresses and 4 hourly and 6 hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam mattresses. This study was also underpowered and at high risk of bias. The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) with 2-hourly repositioning compared with 3-hourly repositioning on a standard mattress was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.16, very low quality evidence). The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) was compatible with a large reduction and no difference between 4-hourly repositioning and 6-hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02, very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The limited data derived from one economic evaluation means it remains unclear whether repositioning every 3 hours using the 30º tilt is less costly in terms of nursing time and more effective than standard care involving repositioning every 6 hours using a 90º tilt.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Recently there has been an increase in the use of ICT (Information Communication Technology) for the delivery of information to people with severe mental illness. ICT is considered to be any technical means of delivering information and communication and can include use of telephones, television, radio, computers and hand-held devices.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified 35 references, with 25 studies, but we could only include two studies with a total of 358 participants. The studies had a moderate risk of bias, and therefore risk overestimating any positive effects of ICT-based prompting. Both included studies compared semi-automatised ICT-based prompting intervention with standard care groups in mental health outpatient care. The interventions were SMS-message and an electronic assistant device. One included study reported our primary outcome, compliance.
<RES> Based on the existing data, there is no evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other (n = 347, 2 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.70 to 3.05, low quality evidence). Included studies did not report outcomes of service utilisation, behaviour, costs or adverse events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of pre-referral rectal artesunate for people with suspected severe malaria, living in rural areas without healthcare services. After searching for all relevant trials up to May 2014 they included only one randomized controlled trial. This trial was conducted at various sites across Ghana, Tanzania and Bangladesh, and enrolled 17,826 children and adults.
<ABS> What is severe malaria and how might pre-referral rectal artesunate reduce deaths?
<ABS> Severe malaria is a serious medical condition caused by infection with the Plasmodium parasite which typically causes vomiting, anaemia, fitting, coma, and death. It is treated by giving injections of antimalarial drugs, which need to be started as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of death and brain damage. In some rural areas where malaria is common, people have to travel for several hours to reach healthcare clinics and hospitals, and many die on the way. In these settings, people without formal healthcare education could be trained to give artesunate rectally to start treating malaria before transporting the patient to hospital.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Only one trial evaluated rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment. In the African sites only, children aged 6 to 72 months were included in the trial; while in the Asian trial site, older children and adults were included.
<ABS> Young children in the African and Asian trial sites (aged 6 to 72 months) had fewer deaths with rectal artesunate than with placebo (moderate quality evidence). However, in Asia among older children and adults, there were more deaths in those that received rectal artesunate (low quality evidence).
<ABS> In the African sites, 56% of children took longer than six hours to reach hospital whereas over 90% of people in the Asian site reached hospital within six hours.
<ABS> The unexpected finding of more deaths with rectal artesunate in older children and adults should be taken into account when forming national and local policies about pre-referral treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One trial met the inclusion criteria; a placebo-controlled trial of 17,826 children and adults living in rural villages in Ghana and Tanzania (Africa) and Bangladesh (Asia). Villagers with no previous medical training were trained to recognize the symptoms of severe malaria, administer rectal artesunate and refer patients to hospital. The trained villagers were supervised during the trial period. In the African sites only children aged 6 to 72 months were enrolled, whereas in Bangladesh, older children and adults were also enrolled.
<RES> In young children (aged 6 to 72 months) there were fewer deaths following rectal artesunate than with placebo (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; one trial; 8050 participants; moderate quality evidence), while in older children and adults there were more deaths in those given rectal artesunate (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.18 to 4.15; one trial; 4018 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> In Africa, only 56% of participants reached a secondary healthcare facility within six hours compared to over 90% in Asia. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of participants reaching a healthcare facility within six hours (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; 12,068 participants), or in the proportion with parasitaemia (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; 17,826 participants), or with coma or convulsions on arrival (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 12,068 participants).
<RES> There are no existing trials that compare rectal versus intramuscular artesunate.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is a nursing handover?
<ABS> A nursing handover occurs when one nurse hands over the responsibility of care for a patient to another nurse, for example, at the end of a nursing shift. On average, nursing handovers occur three times a day for each patient.
<ABS> What styles of nursing handover exist?
<ABS> In daily practice handovers are done in various ways, some handovers are done through nurses talking to each other (verbal handovers). Others are done through nurses reading the patient’s medical notes or through a combination of reading and talking to each other. In some cases they are done at the patient’s bedside, so that the patient can contribute, if desired.
<ABS> Why does the style of nursing handovers need to be investigated?
<ABS> When a nurse hands over responsibility of care to another nurse there is an opportunity for error if all the important medical information is not shared thoroughly and efficiently. Failing to mention - or grasp - information may result in delays in treatment or diagnosis for the patient, inappropriate treatment, or failure to provide appropriate care. Consequently, an accurate handover of clinical information is essential to ensure continuity of care and patients’ safety.
<ABS> The purpose and findings of this review
<ABS> This review tried to find out which nursing handover style works best.
<ABS> In March 2013 the review authors conducted a wide search for suitable relevant studies (randomised controlled studies) that compared different styles of nursing handover. However, they were not able to identify any randomised controlled studies that investigated the question, and so could draw no conclusions. Further research in this area is urgently needed.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve hospital nursing handover, specifically:

<H1> Psychological interventions for acute pain after open heart surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Psychological treatments to reduce pain in people undergoing open heart surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review investigated whether psychological treatment could successfully reduce acute postoperative pain and improve the course of physical and psychological recovery of people undergoing open heart surgery. We found 19 studies including a total of 2164 participants which reported effects of psychological treatment compared to a control group on pain intensity, use of pain medication, mental distress, mobility and duration of intubation after surgery. We did not find evidence that psychological treatment reduces pain intensity or enhances mobility after open heart surgery. Psychological treatment proved to be slightly better than standard care in reducing mental distress. We did not find clear evidence that psychological treatment leads to a reduced intubation time after surgery. No adverse effect of psychological treatment was described in any primary study.
<ABS> However, studies were of low quality in general, and there was also variation between the results of studies. The latest search was conducted in September 2013. Studies were mostly conducted without external financial support or funded by non-commercial national or regional research associations or student fellowships. Conflicts of interest were not stated in any study.
<ABS> Further research of high quality is required to answer the question of whether psychological treatment has the potential to reduce postoperative pain and improve recovery after open heart surgery.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen trials were included (2164 participants).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There is a small percentage of women for whom giving birth leads to psychosis. Postnatal psychosis affects one to two in every 1000 new mothers and is almost always a mood disorder accompanied by loss of contact with reality, hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations), having strange beliefs (delusions), severe thought disturbance, and abnormal behaviour. It can be a life-threatening condition with an abrupt onset within a month of childbirth.
<ABS> This review investigated the best available evidence for interventions aimed at preventing postnatal psychosis. Unfortunately, no studies were found that could be included. Nevertheless, this review raises many unanswered questions and strongly suggests that future research on postnatal psychosis is much needed. Despite a growing interest in women’s mental health, knowledge and research on postnatal psychosis is still very limited. Future well-designed, well-conducted and well-reported studies are necessary to help improve prevention of symptoms and treatment for women with postnatal psychosis.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Can vocational rehabilitation help workers return to work after having injured their fingers, hand or arm?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Injuries sustained to fingers, hand, or arm can seriously limit a person's ability to continue working normally. In many countries law compels employers to help injured workers when the injury affects their work ability. This help is often referred to as vocational rehabilitation.
<ABS> What is vocational rehabilitation?
<ABS> Vocational rehabilitation consists of a range of ways to help disabled workers return to work or to find a new job. Return-to-work (RTW) can be supported by helping the injured worker cope better, by workplace adjustments, or by physical exercises. Although all these strategies are used in practice, there is no evidence in the form of systematic reviews on which approach is best and in which circumstances.
<ABS> What does the research show?
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> There is no evidence from RCTs to say if vocational rehabilitation can help workers with upper limb injuries return to work. We need RCTs conducted with workers with upper limb injuries to see if vocational rehabilitation can improve their RTW. These studies should be conducted and reported according to agreed standards for high quality research. They should describe the content of vocational rehabilitation in detail. They should also report the number of workers that have returned to work at the end of follow-up or the time it took for them to return to work.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Self management programmes have been advocated as a means to help people with asthma achieve better levels of asthma control and better asthma-related outcomes. However, there are a number of barriers affecting the successful implementation and uptake of these programmes. These barriers call for innovative approaches for the delivery of self management programmes. Of particular interest is the use of consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers as a means of delivering these programmes within the existing healthcare configuration.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review assessed whether smartphone and tablet computer apps are effective tools for supporting patients with asthma to self manage their own condition.
<ABS> Description of the studies
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Due to the lack of enough included studies and the considerable differences between them, we were unable to obtain conclusive answers to our research question. One study showed that the use of a smartphone app can result in better asthma-related quality of life and lung function, and reduced visits to the emergency department. The other study failed to show any significant improvements in asthma-related outcomes after using a smartphone app as a delivery mechanism.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinicians, policy-makers and the general public with regards to the effectiveness of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of June 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two RCTs with a total of 408 participants. We found no cluster RCTs, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Both RCTs evaluated the effect of a mobile phone-based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper-based asthma self management. One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations. In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three-colour traffic light display on their phones. Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma.
<RES> We did not conduct a meta-analysis of the data extracted due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between these studies. Instead we adopted a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, the results were inconclusive and we judged the evidence to have a GRADE rating of low quality because further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. In addition, there was not enough information in one of the included studies to assess the risk of bias for the majority of the domains. Although the other included study was methodologically rigorous, it was not possible to blind participants or personnel in the study. Moreover, there are concerns in both studies in relation to attrition bias and other sources of bias.
<RES> One study showed that the use of a smartphone app for the delivery of an asthma self management programme had no statistically significant effect on asthma symptom scores (mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.25), asthma-related quality of life (MD of mean scores 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39), unscheduled visits to the emergency department (OR 7.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 140.76) or frequency of hospital admissions (odds ratio (OR) 3.07, 95% CI 0.32 to 29.83). The other included study found that the use of a smartphone app resulted in higher asthma-related quality of life scores at six-month follow-up (MD 5.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 9.52 for the physical component score of the SF-12 questionnaire; MD 6.00, 95% CI 2.51 to 9.49 for the mental component score of the SF-12 questionnaire), improved lung function (PEFR) at four (MD 27.80, 95% CI 4.51 to 51.09), five (MD 31.40, 95% CI 8.51 to 54.29) and six months (MD 39.20, 95% CI 16.58 to 61.82), and reduced visits to the emergency department due to asthma-related complications (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.99). Both studies failed to find any statistical differences in terms of adherence to the intervention and occurrence of other asthma-related complications.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Our aim in this review was to find out how well mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) works and how safe it is to use in people with neuromuscular disorders (diseases of the peripheral nerves or muscles) who have breathing problems.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) sometimes have weak breathing muscles. This can make it difficult for them to cough and clear mucus from the lungs well, putting them at risk of repeated chest infections and ongoing lung disease. MI-E is one of a number of methods used to improve cough and mucus clearance. MI-E is given through a mask, mouthpiece, or via a tracheostomy (an opening in the neck into the windpipe). MI-E acts like a cough by first pushing air into the lungs when the person breathes in (insufflation), then sucking it out again (exsufflation).
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> We carried out a wide database search for trials of MI-E in people with NMDs. We only included trials in which people were assigned to the treatments by chance, as these studies provide the best quality evidence.
<ABS> Results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found five trials, with 105 people. They all studied the immediate effects of a single treatment with MI-E. The studies compared MI-E to other ways of helping people cough, or normal cough without help. One trial studied MI-E when added to other treatment. Based on three trials, MI-E may improve the outwards flow of air during coughing compared to a normal cough without help. MI-E was not clearly better than other methods of improving cough. None of the studies measured the outcomes that we thought were important for making decisions about the usefulness of MI-E. For example, the studies did not report on survival, length of hospital stay, quality of life, or serious side effects. One study reported extreme tiredness as a side effect of MI-E. There was often not enough information in the reports to tell whether the studies were well run; in some we found design problems that could have affected the results.
<ABS> The findings of this review do not give enough evidence on which to make decisions. We were unable to find any information from trials on important short- and long-term effects, including side effects of MI-E in NMDs.
<ABS> There is currently insufficient evidence for or against the use of MI-E to help people with NMDs clear mucus from their lungs. Further studies are needed to better understand the benefits and risks of MI-E in relation to other methods of cough assistance.
<ABS> The evidence in the review is up to date as of 7 October 2013.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the efficacy and safety of MI-E in people with NMDs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People who have had measles, or measles vaccine, have antibodies against the virus in their blood that protect them from developing measles should they come into contact with it. These antibodies can be extracted from blood donated by these individuals.
<ABS> If people without antibodies come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles, they are likely to contract the disease. Measles is usually debilitating and can have serious consequences including death, so preventing it is desirable. One way of preventing measles in this group, when they do come into contact with a contagious person, is to inject them with antibodies that have been extracted from blood donations. This has been practised since the 1920s, but measures of its effectiveness have varied and the minimum amount of antibodies that we can give to prevent measles is unknown.
<ABS> The antibody injection is often recommended for pregnant women, infants and immunocompromised people (if they do not have their own antibodies to measles and come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles). The included studies did not include these groups of people, so it is unknown whether the effectiveness of antibody injections is different for them. We were also unable to identify the minimum dose of antibodies required as only one study measured the specific amount of measles antibodies in the injections and one other study estimated this figure; the results of these two studies were not consistent.
<ABS> The evidence is current to August 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one RCT, two quasi-RCTs and 10 cohort studies (3925 participants). No studies were rated as low risk of bias for all criteria. Critical appraisal was constrained by a lack of information in most studies. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate.
<RES> Based on three studies (893 participants) immunoglobulin was effective at preventing death due to measles compared to no treatment (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.44).
<RES> Two studies included measles vaccine alone among the intervention groups. Meta-analysis could not be undertaken. Both studies suggested the vaccine was more effective than gamma globulin.
<RES> No serious adverse events were observed in any of the included studies, although reporting of adverse events was poor overall. Non-serious adverse events included transient fever, rash, muscle stiffness, local redness and induration.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It seems the dose of immunoglobulin administered impacts on effectiveness. A minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies could not be identified.
<CON> Passive immunisation is effective at preventing deaths from measles, reducing the risk by 76% compared to no treatment. Whether the benefits of passive immunisation vary among subgroups of non-immune exposed people could not be determined.
<CON> Due to a paucity of evidence comparing vaccine to passive immunisation, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding relative effectiveness.
<CON> The included studies were not specifically designed to detect adverse events.
<CON> Future research should consider the effectiveness of passive immunisation for preventing measles in high-risk populations such as pregnant women, immunocompromised people and infants. Further efforts should be made to determine the minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies for post-exposure prophylaxis and the relative effectiveness of vaccine compared to immunoglobulin.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chromium picolinate supplementation for overweight or obese people

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are chromium supplements useful for reducing body weight in overweight or obese adults?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chromium is an essential nutrient (trace element) required for the normal metabolism of carbohydrate, protein and fat (i.e. the chemical reactions involved in breaking down these molecules to a form suitable for absorption by the body). Chromium increases the activity of insulin, and dietary supplementation with chromium has produced improvements in glucose metabolism which may lower blood glucose being important for overweight people with diabetes. It is generally believed that chromium may help to reduce a person's weight by decreasing the amount of fat in the body. Chromium is also said to suppress the appetite and stimulate the production of heat by the body, thus increasing energy expenditure. This may contribute to weight loss. Chromium picolinate is one of several chemical compounds of chromium sold as a nutritional supplement as a potential aid to weight loss.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included nine randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of 8 to 24 weeks of chromium supplementation and placebo in overweight or obese adults (i.e. with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2 defining being overweight and a body mass index of 30kg/m2 or more defining obesity). A total of 622 participants took part in the studies, 346 participants received chromium picolinate and 276 received placebo. The evidence is current to December 2012.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When the results obtained from the doses of chromium picolinate investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) were pooled, study participants lost around 1 kg of body weight more than participants receiving placebo. We were unable to find good evidence that this potential weight loss effect increased with increasing dose of chromium picolinate. Only three of nine studies provided information on adverse events, so we were unable to determine whether chromium picolinate supplements are safe and whether any potential harms may increase with dose. In addition, the length of studies included was rather short (maximum of 24 weeks), so we were unable to determine any long-term effects of supplementation. No study reported whether supplementation was associated with increases in deaths from any cause or illnesses (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or the health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects of supplementation.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was considered low and we have inadequate information from which to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate supplementation in overweight or obese adults.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of CrP supplementation in overweight or obese people.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We evaluated nine RCTs involving a total of 622 participants. The RCTs were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals, and had a short- to medium-term follow up (up to 24 weeks). Three RCTs compared CrP plus resistance or weight training with placebo plus resistance or weight training, the other RCTs compared CrP alone versus placebo. We focused this review on investigating which dose of CrP would prove most effective versus placebo and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose. However, in order to find out if CrP works in general, we also analysed the effect of all pooled CrP doses versus placebo on body weight only.
<RES> Across all CrP doses investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) we noted an effect on body weight in favour of CrP of debatable clinical relevance after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.7 to -0.4); P = 0.001; 392 participants; 6 trials; low-quality evidence (GRADE)). No firm evidence and no dose gradient could be established when comparing different doses of CrP with placebo for various weight loss measures (body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat composition, change in waist circumference).
<RES> Only three studies provided information on adverse events (low-quality evidence (GRADE)). There were two serious adverse events and study dropouts in participants taking 1000 µg CrP, and one serious adverse event in an individual taking 400 µg CrP. Two participants receiving placebo discontinued due to adverse events; one event was reported as serious. No study reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is the medical problem?
<ABS> Muscle, ligament and tendon injuries frequently occur during activities such as sports, and may be due to tissue degeneration. These injuries are more frequent in particular parts of the body, such as the tendons located in the shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle.
<ABS> What treatments are available?
<ABS> Several treatment options are available. These include conservative methods, such as physical therapy, and surgery, for example to repair torn tendons. Another, increasingly popular, therapy is platelet-rich therapy.
<ABS> What is platelet-rich therapy?
<ABS> Platelets form part of blood. They produce growth factors that assist in repair and regeneration of tissue. It is possible that if a high concentration of platelets is applied to an injury, healing may progress faster. Platelet-rich therapy involves the production of a platelet-rich (concentrated) fraction of the patient's own blood. This is then applied, such as by an injection, to the site of injury.
<ABS> Does it work?
<ABS> This review set out to examine the evidence to see if platelet-rich therapy (PRT) works in practice.
<ABS> We searched medical databases (until March 2013) and registers of new studies (until March 2012) and found 19 studies that compared PRT with a control condition (such as no PRT). These involved a total of 1088 participants. Most participants were men, except in trials involving shoulder (rotator cuff) injuries, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies (sometimes called tendinitis), where similar numbers of women were included.
<ABS> The 19 trials covered eight types of injury, some of which were being treated surgically: rotator cuff tears (surgical repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome (surgery to release trapped tissues in the shoulder) (one trial); tennis elbow (three trials); knee ligament reconstruction using a section of tendon from the patient (four trials); the donor site of the tendon used for knee ligament reconstruction (two trials); patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) (one trial); Achilles tendinopathy (tendinitis) (one trial); and acute rupture of the Achilles tendon (surgical repair) (one trial).
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is very low, partly because most trials used flawed methods that mean their results may not be reliable. The trials also used different ways of preparing and applying the platelet-rich plasma. We were only able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 studies and 45% of participants.
<ABS> When we pooled the limited data that was available for all these conditions, we found very weak (very low quality) evidence for a slight benefit of PRT in pain in the short term (up to three months). However, pooled data do not show that PRT makes a difference in function in the short, medium or long term. There was weak evidence that suggested that adverse events (harms) occurred at comparable, low rates in people treated with PRT and people not treated with PRT.
<ABS> In terms of individual conditions, we were able to pool results from six studies and found no differences in long-term function between those who received PRT during rotator cuff surgery and those who did not. Pooled data for short-term function from three tennis elbow studies showed a slight benefit for people receiving PRT but it is uncertain if this difference would actually be meaningful for a patient.
<ABS> In conclusion, the available evidence is insufficient to to support the use of PRT for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries or show whether the effects of PRT vary according to the type of injury. Any future research in this area should bear in mind the several studies currently going on and should consider the need for standardisation of the PRP preparation.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included data from 19 small single centre trials (17 randomised and two quasi-randomised; 1088 participants) that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy. These trials covered eight clinical conditions: rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (one trial); elbow epicondylitis (three trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (four trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application) (two trials), patellar tendinopathy (one trial), Achilles tendinopathy (one trial) and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (one trial). We also grouped trials into 'tendinopathies' where platelet-rich therapy (PRT) injections were the main treatment (five trials), and surgical augmentation procedures where PRT was applied during surgery (14 trials). Trial participants were mainly male, except in trials including rotator cuff tears, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies.
<RES> Three trials were judged as being at low risk of bias; the other 16 were at high or unclear risk of bias relating to selection, detection, attrition or selective reporting, or combinations of these. The methods of preparing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) varied and lacked standardisation and quantification of the PRP applied to the patient.
<RES> We were able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 trials and 45% of participants. The evidence for all primary outcomes was judged as being of very low quality.
<RES> Data assessing function in the short term (up to three months) were pooled from five trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions and used four different measures. These showed no significant difference between PRT and control (SMD 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.56; P value 0.13; I² = 35%; 273 participants; positive values favour PRT). Medium-term function data (at six months) were pooled from six trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.06; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.51; P value 0.79; I² = 64%; 262 participants). Long-term function data (at one year) were pooled from 10 trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.57; P value 0.12; I² = 66%; 484 participants). Although the 95% confidence intervals indicate the possibility of a slightly poorer outcome in the PRT group up to a moderate difference in favour of PRT at short- and long-term follow-up, these do not translate into clinically relevant differences.
<RES> Data pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions showed a small reduction in short-term pain in favour of PRT on a 10-point scale (MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.48; I² = 0%; 175 participants). The clinical significance of this result is marginal.
<RES> Four trials reported adverse events; another seven trials reported an absence of adverse events. There was no difference between treatment groups in the numbers of participants with adverse effects (7/241 versus 5/245; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.59; I² = 0%; 486 participants).
<RES> In terms of individual conditions, we pooled heterogeneous data for long-term function from six trials of PRT application during rotator cuff tear surgery. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the two groups (324 participants). Pooled data for short-term function for three elbow epicondylitis trials (179 participants) showed a statistically significant difference in favour of PRT, but the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.
<RES> The available evidence is insufficient to indicate whether the effects of PRT will differ importantly in individual clinical conditions.

<H1> Yoga for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Yoga to prevent cardiovascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global health burden. Nevertheless, it is thought that the risk of CVD can be lowered by changing a number of risk factors, such as by increasing physical activity and using relaxation to reduce stress, both of which are components of yoga. This review assessed the effectiveness of any type of yoga in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD.
<ABS> Study Characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of yoga on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> We found 11 trials (800 participants), none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of yoga on decreasing death or non-fatal endpoints.There were variations in the style and duration of yoga and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to eight months.The results showed that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (a blood lipid), and uncertain effects on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. None of the included trials reported adverse events, the occurrence of type 2 diabetes or costs. Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of yoga for CVD prevention.
<ABS> Quality of the Evidence
<ABS> These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution. This is because the included studies were of short duration, small and at risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 11 trials (800 participants) and two ongoing studies. Style and duration of yoga differed between trials. Half of the participants recruited to the studies were at high risk of CVD. Most of studies were at risk of performance bias, with inadequate details reported in many of them to judge the risk of selection bias.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> A structured collateral interview regarding cognition and function (the IQCODE) for assessment of possible dementia

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A synthesis of the available data regarding IQCODE accuracy will help inform cognitive assessment strategies for clinical practice, research and policy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> From 16,144 citations, 71 papers described IQCODE test accuracy. We included 10 papers (11 independent datasets) representing data from 2644 individuals (n = 379 (14%) with dementia). Using IQCODE cut-offs commonly employed in clinical practice (3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) the sensitivity and specificity of IQCODE for diagnosis of dementia across the studies were generally above 75%.
<RES> Taking an IQCODE threshold of 3.3 (or closest available) the sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85); specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90); positive likelihood ratio was 5.2 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.5) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.29).
<RES> Comparative analysis suggested no significant difference in the test accuracy of the 16 and 26-item IQCODE tests and no significant difference in test accuracy by language of administration. There was little difference in sensitivity across our predefined diagnostic cut-points.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity in the included studies. Sensitivity analyses removing potentially unrepresentative populations in these studies made little difference to the pooled data estimates.
<RES> The majority of included papers had potential for bias, particularly around participant selection and sampling. The quality of reporting was suboptimal particularly regarding timing of assessments and descriptors of reproducibility and inter-observer variability.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review was undertaken to assess evidence on the effectiveness of auditory-verbal therapy in promoting spoken language development in children with permanent hearing impairments. Whilst many studies have examined the effectiveness of AVT, no studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Well-designed studies are urgently needed to examine the effectiveness of AVT in promoting spoken language development in children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Patients undergoing general anaesthesia need to have their airway protected as they lose their normal reflexes. This is most commonly achieved by placing a tube down through the mouth and larynx into the trachea (a tracheal tube (TT)) and using this to ventilate the lungs. Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) offer an alternative; they extend from the mouth into the throat but sit above the larynx. The number of obese patients requiring general anaesthesia is likely to increase because obesity is becoming more common and is a risk factor for many chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, cancers and cardiovascular disease. Securing the airway in obese patients may be difficult, and obese patients are at increased risk for complications during anaesthesia, such as difficulty passing an airway and aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs. SADs offer potential benefits, but concerns remain that they may increase the risk of these serious complications.
<ABS> We searched the databases to September 2012, to find controlled trials that had randomly assigned obese participants (with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2) undergoing general anaesthesia to TT or SAD for airway management. We wanted to investigate the effect of airway type on risk of failed placement; serious complications and death; oxygenation of the blood during and after surgery; coughing, sore throat or hoarseness during or after placement; and time taken and number of attempts needed to fit the airway.
<ABS> We found two randomized studies with a total of 232 obese participants, both of which studied one model of SAD－the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA). No relevant outcomes for death or other serious complications occurred in these studies.We found that in 3% to 5% of obese participants, it was not possible to fit a PLMA, and a change of device to a TT was required. The proportion of successful first attempts at airway placement did not differ between PLMA and TT, although it took approximately six seconds longer to place an SAD than a TT. We found significant postoperative reduction of almost 75% in episodes of low oxygen saturation and an improvement in mean oxygen saturation of 2.5% during recovery in the PLMA group. Postoperative cough was less common among participants in the PLMA group. Our findings are consistent with both increased and decreased risks of both sore throat and hoarseness in the PLMA group.
<ABS> Identifying optimal anaesthetic techniques for obese patients is a priority for research. We could not establish the safety of SAD use in obese patients. Large databases created from medical records may be needed to clarify this issue.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two eligible studies, both comparing the use of one model of SAD, the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) with a TT, with a total study population of 232. One study population underwent laparoscopic surgery. The included studies were generally of high quality, but there was an unavoidable high risk of bias in the main airway variables, such as change of device or laryngospasm, as the intubator could not be blinded. Many outcomes included data from one study only.
<RES> A total of 5/118 (4.2%) participants randomly assigned to PLMA across both studies were changed to TT insertion because of failed or unsatisfactory placement of the device. Postoperative episodes of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation < 92% whilst breathing air) were less common in the PLMA groups (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.72). We found a significant postoperative difference in mean oxygen saturation, with saturation 2.54% higher in the PLMA group (95% CI 1.09% to 4.00%). This analysis showed high levels of heterogeneity between results (I2 = 71%). The leak fraction was significantly higher in the PLMA group, with the largest difference seen during abdominal insufflation－a 6.4% increase in the PLMA group (95% CI 3.07% to 9.73%).
<RES> No cases of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, mortality or serious respiratory complications were reported in either study. We are therefore unable to present effect estimates for these outcomes.
<RES> In all, 2/118 participants with a PLMA suffered laryngospam or bronchospasm compared with 4/114 participants with a TT. The pooled estimate shows a non-significant reduction in laryngospasm in the PLMA group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.59).
<RES> Postoperative coughing was less common in the PLMA group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31), and there was no significant difference in the risk of sore throat or dysphonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.13). On average, PLMA placement took 5.9 seconds longer than TT placement (95% CI 3 seconds to 8.8 seconds). There was no significant difference in the proportion of successful first placements of a device, with 33/35 (94.2%) first-time successes in the PLMA group and 32/35 (91.4%) in the TT group.

<H1> Aminoadamantanes for chronic hepatitis C

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Aminoadamantanes for chronic hepatitis C

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Hepatitis C virus is mainly transmitted by contact with infected blood. Chronic hepatitis C infection affects around 3% of the world's population and progresses slowly. Most patients present without symptoms, or with symptoms like fatigue or liver-related morbidity (illness). Frequently, the disease is discovered by coincidence because of abnormal laboratory results. Between 5% and 40% of all infected patients will develop severe liver damage, which can cause severe liver-related morbidities and eventually death. Current treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, and in some groups of patients these two agents are administered in combination with antiviral drugs such as telaprevir or boceprevir. It is then possible to eradicate the virus from the blood in at least 70% of patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the clinical effects are not known.
<ABS> Review questions and study characteristics
<ABS> Only amantadine has been tested in randomised clinical trials including participants with chronic hepatitis C. The main goal of these trials was to investigate whether amantadine as a single therapy or amantadine in combination with other antiviral therapy, compared with placebo or no intervention (with or without antiviral therapy), could increase the proportion of patients with virus eradication from the blood. This review evaluates whether amantadine has any beneficial or harmful effect in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity (combined outcome) and adverse events. The review includes 41 randomised clinical trials with a total of 6193 patients.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> This review shows that there seems to be no significant benefit of amantadine on hepatitis C-infected patients regarding all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity. We were unable to assess the effect of amantadine on quality of life due to lack of data from the trials. Furthermore, amantadine did not increase the proportion of patients with a sustained virological response which is clearance of the virus from the blood six months after treatment. We considered all the included trials to have a high risk of bias. Accordingly, the evidence from this review does not support the routine clinical use of amantadine. There is some justification for amantadine to be used in future randomised clinical trials. We found no randomised clinical trials assessing other aminoadamantanes, for example rimantadine.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 41 randomised clinical trials with 6193 patients with chronic hepatitis C. All trials had high risk of bias. All included trials compared amantadine versus placebo or no intervention. Standard antiviral therapy was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in 40 trials. The standard antiviral therapy, which was administered to both intervention groups, was interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, and peg interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, depending on the time when the trial was conducted.
<RES> The observed beneficial effects could be true effects but could also be due to both systematic errors (bias) and random errors (play of chance). The latter is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm or refute our findings. We were not able to perform meta-analyses for failure of histological improvement or quality of life due to a lack of valid data.

<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, has been produced to assess the effects of antibiotics on pain and swelling in two conditions commonly responsible for causing dental pain when given with or without dental treatment (such as extraction, drainage of a swelling or root canal treatment).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Dental pain is a common problem and can arise when the nerve within a tooth dies due to progressing decay or severe trauma. The tissue around the end of the root then becomes inflamed and this can lead to acute pain, which gets worse on biting. Without treatment, bacteria can infect the dead tooth and cause a dental abscess, which can lead to swelling and spreading infection that may be life threatening.
<ABS> The recommended treatment of this form of toothache is the removal the dead nerve and associated bacteria. This is usually done by dental extraction or root canal treatment. Antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is severe infection that has spread from the tooth. However, some dentists still routinely prescribe oral antibiotics to people with acute dental conditions that have no signs of spreading infection.
<ABS> Minimising inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is plays a key role in limiting the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Since dentists prescribe approximately 8% to 10% of all primary care antibiotics in developed countries, dental prescribing may contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, it is important that antibiotics should only be used when they are clinically beneficial for the person.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 1 October 2013. We searched scientific databases and found two trials, with a 62 participants included in the analysis. Both trials were conducted at university dental schools in the USA and evaluated the use of oral antibiotics in the reduction of pain and swelling reported by adults after having the first stage of root canal treatment under local anaesthetic. The antibiotic used in both trials was penicillin VK and all participants also received painkillers.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The two studies included in the review reported that there were no clear differences in the pain or swelling reported by participants who received oral antibiotics compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment) when provided in conjunction with the first stage of root canal treatment and painkillers, but the studies were small and we could not exclude potentially important differences between groups. Neither study examined the effect of antibiotics delivered by themselves, without dental treatment.
<ABS> One trial reported side effects among participants: one person who received the placebo medication had diarrhoea and one person who received antibiotics experienced tiredness and reduced energy after their operation.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of evidence to be very low. There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to determine the effects of antibiotics in these conditions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Hearing aids for tinnitus in people with hearing loss

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Our search identified just one randomised controlled trial which evaluated 91 participants who had tinnitus for at least six months and some degree of hearing loss. It compared those receiving hearing aids to those receiving sound generators. The average age of the patients was 38 and there were 40 women and 51 men. The study took place in two centres in Italy and the USA.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The result from the single study we reviewed was not definitive and was compatible with only small differences between the effect of hearing aids and sound generators. We also found another relevant study which has not yet been completed. We believe further high-quality trials are needed.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of this evidence is moderate to low. This review is up to date to August 2013.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Psychological therapies (Internet-delivered) for the management of chronic pain in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Chronic pain (i.e. pain lasting longer than three months) is common. Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) can help people to cope with pain, depression and disability that can occur with such pain. Treatments currently are delivered via hospital out-patient consultation (face-to-face) or more recently through the Internet. This review looks at the evidence for psychological therapies delivered via the Internet for adults with chronic pain.
<ABS> Four databases were searched up to November 2013. We found 15 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Four trials included individuals with headache pain, 10 trials included individuals with non-headache pain, and one trial included individuals with both headache and non-headache pain. We looked at data about pain, disability, depression, and anxiety immediately after the end of treatment and between 3 to 12 months follow-up. We also looked at how satisfied people were with the treatments, and its effects on their quality of life.
<ABS> We conclude that these findings are promising for psychological treatments delivered via the Internet for the management of chronic pain in adults, but more trials are needed to determine the efficacy of such therapies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifteen studies (N= 2012) were included in analyses. We assessed the risk of bias for included studies as low overall. We identified nine high 'risk of bias' assessments, 22 unclear, and 59 low 'risk of bias' assessments. Most judgements of a high risk of bias were due to inadequate reporting.
<RES> No data were presented on satisfaction/acceptability. Only one study could be included in an analysis of the effect of psychological therapies on quality of life in participants with headache conditions; hence, no analysis could be undertaken. Three studies presented quality of life data for participants with non-headache conditions; however, no clear evidence of benefit was found (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.01, p > 0.05).


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> and both groups of participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the care received. This study also examined economic modelling of costs of the POA as performed by the nurse and by the non-specialist doctor based on the completeness of the assessment as noted in the study and found no difference in cost.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Participants were followed for three years. Mortality at the last follow-up was 64% (9/14) in the microwave group and 75% (12/16) in the conventional surgery group (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.39), that is, no significant difference was observed. In the microwave coagulation group, 71%, 57%, and 14% survived 1, 2, and 3 years, and in the conventional surgery group, the percentages were 69%, 56%, and 23%. The hazard ratio calculated using the Parmar method was 0.91 (0.39 to 2.15).
<RES> Mean survival time was 27 months in the microwave group and 25 months in the conventional surgery group, and the mean disease-free interval was 11.3 months in the microwave group and 13.3 months in the hepatectomy group. Differences for both outcomes were not statistically significant. Reported frequency of adverse events was similar between the microwave coagulation and conventional surgery groups, except for the required blood transfusion, which was more common in the conventional surgery group. No intervention-related mortality was observed. After treatment, the carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased significantly in both groups.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We wanted to know whether twice-daily treatment with an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist was better than treatment with a dummy inhaler for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
<ABS> Background to the review
<ABS> COPD is a disease of the lungs that causes airways to narrow. As a result, people with COPD experience symptoms of breathlessness, cough and mucus buildup, which worsen over time. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD, and it is the fourth or fifth most common cause of death worldwide.
<ABS> Inhaled salmeterol and formoterol, known as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), are widely used to manage the symptoms of COPD, so it is important to understand their benefits and side effects. They are often introduced when inhaled treatments for quick relief from symptoms (e.g. salbutamol) are no longer helpful. LABAs are designed to be taken twice a day to control symptoms and reduce the likelihood of flare-ups.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> Twenty-six studies (including 14,939 people with moderate to severe symptoms of COPD) compared twice-daily salmeterol or formoterol with a dummy inhaler. The evidence gathered for this review is current up to June 2013. Results within studies were described most often after six months of treatment, but some were reported at three months and others after as long as three years. More men than women took part, and they had moderate to severe symptoms when they began treatment.
<ABS> People who took LABA inhalers showed greater improvement on quality of life scales than those taking dummy inhalers, and they had fewer serious flare-ups that resulted in a hospital stay (18 fewer per 1000). They also had better lung function than people who had taken placebo. LABA inhalers did not reduce the number of people who died, and no significant difference was noted in the number who had serious adverse events while taking the medication.
<ABS> These studies were most often sponsored by drug companies and were generally well designed. People in the studies did not know which treatment they were getting, and neither did the people doing the research. Several studies did not describe flare-ups, hospital stays or lung volume, so there is a chance that evidence obtained in future studies would change the strength of what has been concluded. Additionally, quite a lot of variation was noted between studies in the effects of LABA inhalers on quality of life, serious side effects and lung function. This may be explained in part by variation in study methods regarding what medications people could continue to take.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that causes progressive symptoms of breathlessness, cough and mucus build-up. It is the fourth or fifth most common cause of death worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-six RCTs met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 14,939 people with COPD to receive twice-daily LABA or placebo. Study duration ranged from three months to three years; the median duration was six months. Participants were more often male with moderate to severe symptoms at randomisation; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was between 33% and 55% predicted normal in the studies, and mean St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (SGRQ) ranged from 44 to 55 when reported.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence showed that LABA treatment improved quality of life on the SGRQ (mean difference (MD) -2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.09 to -1.54; I2 = 50%; 17 trials including 11,397 people) and reduced the number of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95; I2 = 10%; seven trials including 3804 people). In absolute terms, 18 fewer people per 1000 were hospitalised as the result of an exacerbation while receiving LABA therapy over a weighted mean of 7 months (95% CI 3 to 31 fewer). Scores were also improved on the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ), and more people receiving LABA treatment showed clinically important improvement of at least four points on the SGRQ.
<RES> The number of people who had exacerbations requiring a course of oral steroids or antibiotics was also lower among those taking LABA (52 fewer per 1000 treated over 8 months; 95% CI 24 to 78 fewer, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Mortality was low, and combined findings of all studies showed that LABA therapy did not significantly affect mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08; I2 = 21%; 23 trials including 14,079 people, moderate quality evidence). LABA therapy did not affect the rate of serious adverse events (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; I2 = 34%, moderate quality evidence), although there was significant unexplained heterogeneity, especially between the two formoterol doses.
<RES> LABA therapy improved predose FEV1 by 73 mL more than placebo (95% CI 48 to 98; I2 = 71%, low quality evidence), and people were more likely to withdraw from placebo than from LABA therapy (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; I2 = 0%). Higher rates of withdrawal in the placebo arm may reduce our confidence in some results, but the disparity is more likely to reduce the magnitude of difference between LABA and placebo than inflate the true effect; removing studies at highest risk of bias on the basis of high and unbalanced attrition did not change conclusions for the primary outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review found only one study which compared the cut-down technique of endovascular repair with the percutaneous technique. The study had 30 participants; 15 underwent the cut-down technique and 15 the percutaneous technique. No one died during the study and the procedure was successful in all participants. However, for one participant the surgery had to be changed from percutaneous access to the cut-down technique, and one participant undergoing the percutaneous surgery had to have the artery repaired surgically due to continued bleeding. The surgery took less time in the percutaneous group compared with the cut-down group (87 minutes versus 108 minutes). There were no other significant differences found in the study.
<ABS> The included study did not report on the methods of randomisation, how the randomisation was concealed and the pre-selected outcomes of interest.
<ABS> This one study did not provide enough data and no firm conclusions could be drawn from it. Larger studies are needed to provide us with more data. The review indicates that the new technique might be a good option for some patients but more research is needed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 30 participants, 15 undergoing the percutaneous technique and 15 treated by the standard femoral cut-down approach. There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline.
<RES> The included study had a small sample size and failed to report adequately the method of randomisation, allocation concealment and the pre-selected outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stem cell transplantation
<ABS> Stem cell transplantation is an important treatment option for individuals with blood cancers (haematological malignancies). During the procedure, blood-forming (stem) cells, derived from the bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood of a healthy donor, are transplanted into a person with a blood cancer. The aim is to replenish the recipient's body with healthy cells after treatment with conditioning regimens such as chemotherapy or radiation (or both). Peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow stem cells are the standard stem cell sources used in adults. The most successful transplantations occur when stem cells are transplanted from a healthy donor whose tissue is genetically compatible with that of the recipient (matched related donor). If no matched donor can be identified, it is possible to transplant cells from a matched unrelated donor or from donors carrying certain mismatches. In principle, the higher the degree of genetic mismatch, the higher the risk of severe transplant-related complications, especially graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in which a donor's white blood cells (T cells) attack the recipient's healthy tissues.
<ABS> Peripheral blood versus bone marrow stem cells
<ABS> Peripheral blood stem cells are collected after the donor has received a drug that acts to mobilise stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood. Bone marrow stem cell donation involves the removal of stem cells from the pelvic bone of the donor under general anaesthesia. Donor convenience as well as logistic reasons favour peripheral blood stem cell donation.
<ABS> This review addresses the question of which stem cell source - bone marrow or peripheral blood - is the most suitable for individuals undergoing stem cell transplantation.
<ABS> Results of this meta-analysis
<ABS> In this systemic review we included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1521 participants. Key inclusion criteria were adults undergoing stem cell transplantation for a blood cancer using either bone marrow stem cells or peripheral stem cells as a stem cell source. Participants were treated between 1994 and 2009. The evidence is current to February 2014.
<ABS> In summary, we found overall and disease-free survival to be comparable for both PBSCT and BMT. Recipients of bone marrow stem cells from related donors were more likely to relapse than recipients of peripheral blood stem cells from related donors, but this difference was not seen in the recipients of bone marrow stem cells from unrelated donors. The incidence of acute GvHD following PBSCT and BMT was comparable; however, there was a tendency to more severe GvHD with PBSCT. PBSCT was associated with higher rates of chronic GvHD. The time to engraftment was significantly shorter with PBSCT than with BMT. The quality of the evidence was considered moderate to high.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Against the background of altering clinical strategies these results confirm that the current practice of using peripheral blood rather than bone marrow as a source of stem cells for stem cell transplantation in adults with haematological malignancies is not deleterious with respect to overall survival.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included nine RCTs that met the pre-defined selection criteria, involving a total of 1521 participants. Quality of data reporting was heterogeneous among the studies. Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low.
<RES> For the primary outcome overall survival, our analysis demonstrated comparable results between bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (six studies, 1330 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; P value = 0.43; high-quality evidence).
<RES> Disease-free survival (six studies, 1225 participants; HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.6; moderate-quality of evidence) and non-relapse or transplant-related mortality (three studies, 758 participants; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28; P = 0.91; high-quality evidence) were also comparable between transplantation arms.
<RES> In the related-donor setting, data from two of eight studies with 211 participants (21%) indicated a higher relapse incidence in participants transplanted with bone marrow stem cells rather than peripheral blood stem cells (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.47 to 5.08; P value = 0.001). There was no clear evidence of a difference in relapse incidence between transplantation groups in unrelated donors (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47; P value = 0.66). The difference between the donor-related and -unrelated subgroups (P-value = 0.008) was considered to be statistically significant.
<RES> BMT was associated with lower rates of overall and extensive chronic GvHD than PBSCT (overall chronic GvHD: four studies, 1121 participants; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; P value = 0.0001, extensive chronic GvHD: four studies, 765 participants; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.9; P value = 0.006; moderate-quality evidence for both outcomes). The incidence of acute GvHD grades II to IV was not lower (six studies, 1330 participants; HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.67; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a trend for a lower incidence of grades III and IV acute GvHD with BMT than with PBSCT (three studies, 925 participants; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; P value = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were longer with BMT than with PBSCT (neutrophil: five studies, 662 participants; HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64 to 2.35; P value < 0.00001; platelet: four studies, 333 participants; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.78; P value < 0.00001).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: What are the most effective ways to improve and sustain exercise behaviour in cancer survivors, that is, people living with and beyond cancer?
<ABS> Background: Being regularly active for people living with and beyond cancer can have a wide range of beneficial effects. These range from improving quality of life to improving physical function. It might also reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and of dying from cancer. We know that most people living with and beyond cancer are not regularly physically active. So, we need to understand how to get those individuals who are not currently exercising to begin to be active and how to help them maintain this change in behaviour.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included only studies that compared an exercise intervention with a usual care comparison. Only studies including sedentary people over the age of 18 with the same cancer diagnosis were eligible. Participants must have been put in a group at random. We searched for evidence from research databases up to August 2012.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The main problems that we found regarding the quality of studies in this review included not knowing how study investigators conducted randomisation for the trials, and whether investigators who were doing trial assessments knew to which group the person they were assessing had been randomly assigned.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen trials were included in this review, involving a total of 648 participants. Only studies involving breast, prostate or colorectal cancer were identified as eligible. Just six trials incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations. Only three trials were identified that attempted to objectively validate independent exercise behaviour with accelerometers or heart rate monitoring. Adherence to exercise interventions, which is crucial for understanding treatment dose, is often poorly reported. It is important to note that the fundamental metrics of exercise behaviour (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration, repetitions, sets and intensity of resistance training), although easy to devise and report, are seldom included in published clinical trials.

<H1> The Lund concept for severe traumatic brain injury

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The Lund concept in the treatment of brain injuries

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the medical literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where people are randomly assigned to a treatment or non-treatment group) that compared the Lund concept versus other treatments. We included people with severe traumatic brain injury, irrespective of their gender, age or race. The latest search was 5 November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no studies comparing the Lund concept versus other treatments. There is no evidence from RCTs that the Lund concept is a preferable treatment for brain injury and further research is needed.

<H1> Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke.
<ABS> Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared with those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.
<ABS> No studies met the inclusion criteria of the review. There is no randomised controlled trial evidence for the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus no intervention in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE and, therefore, we can not draw any conclusions. Well-conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke.
<INT> Traditionally, all PEs are anticoagulated in a similar manner independent of the location, number and size of the thrombi. It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE may be treated without benefit, increasing adverse events by possible unnecessary use of anticoagulants.
<INT> Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared with those with proximal PEs. However, the clinical significance in patients and their prognosis have to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Trifluoperazine (trade name Stelazine) is a long-established antipsychotic drug that has been used since the 1950s to treat schizophrenia. It is one of the first generation (typical) drugs that have proven very effective for treating the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs. These drugs may cause side effects such as involuntary shaking, restlessness and movement disorders such as having a strange posture.
<ABS> There are also more modern drugs (second generation and atypical antipsychotic drugs). These are effective with the ‘positive symptoms’ of mental illness but also help treat ‘negative symptoms’ such as apathy, weight gain and loss of emotion in people with schizophrenia. These more modern drugs are much more expensive.
<ABS> This review is based on a search for trials carried out in July 2012, and includes 10 studies with 686 participants. The aim was to determine the effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia when compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment). As expected, people given trifluoperazine showed a significant improvement compared to placebo in both the short and medium term, reinforcing the use of this well-established typical antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia. However, trifluoperazine can cause side effects such as confusion, agitation, having a dry mouth and blurred vision, but causes less sedation and dizzy spells, so is generally well tolerated by people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> The authors of the review conclude that trifluoperazine has similar effectiveness to other common antipsychotic drugs, although it may cause more side effects. Evidence used in the review was also graded as low or very low quality. In the light of this, use of other antipsychotic drugs should be considered before starting on trifluoperazine. Most of the included studies were conducted roughly 40 years ago so new, large, comprehensive and independent research trials are needed.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine absolute effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses compared with placebo.

<H1> TITLE
<H1> Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food. It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer. Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival. However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery. Such patients receive palliative treatment. Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear. We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments. We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions. We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors.
<ABS> Characteristics of studies
<ABS> We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials. Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment. The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin.
<ABS> Main results
<ABS> Approximately 97% of patients who underwent cancer removal surgery survived the surgery in the two trials. The patients who received surgery were twice as likely to live as those who received other treatments. The survivors were followed until at least five years. There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group while approximately 40% of the patients who underwent surgical removal were alive at the end of three years. This difference in survival was statistically significant. The studies did not report the complications related to surgery although it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from complications in both groups. None of the trials reported quality of life. There was no evidence of any difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of a patient related to the treatment) between the two groups. The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the surgical removal group (by about USD 10,000) than in the palliative treatment group in the trial conducted in Japan. There was no information about the costs in the other trial, which was conducted in Greece.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Overall, the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, there is a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions). This was because it was not clear how the randomisation was performed, whether the people assessing the outcomes were aware of the group to which the participants belonged, and whether all participants were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was very low as the trials were at high risk of bias and there were few trials to assess whether only studies with negative results were published.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> There is very low quality evidence that surgical resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with involvement of veins. In selected patients pancreatic resection could be considered for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased complications associated with the surgical procedure and when sufficient expertise is available.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain more precise results and to assess the quality of life of patients and the value for money of surgical removal versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Historically, corticosteroids have been the backbone of immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and corticosteroids are typically started immediately before or during transplantation. However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with several complications such as infection, hepatitis C virus recurrence, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, fracture, and reduced quality of life. Hence, corticosteroid avoidance and corticosteroid reduction regimens for liver transplant recipients have been developed.
<ABS> Antibodies against T-cells are also used to induce immunosuppression after liver transplantation. This T-cell specific antibody induction therapy is intended to reduce rejection of the transplanted liver and is given within the first two weeks after transplantation. Furthermore, these antibodies may allow for delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors to protect kidney function.
<ABS> Different types of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy have been used for liver transplant recipients: interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (BT563, daclizumab, or basiliximab), monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 receptor (muromonab-CD3) or the CD52 surface protein (alemtuzumab), and polyclonal antibodies (rabbit or horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)). A novel approach has been to replace corticosteroids with T-cell specific antibody induction as part of a corticosteroid reduction or avoidance regimen. The benefits and harms of this T-cell specific antibody induction therapy remain unclear.
<ABS> Aim
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether antibody induction therapy was better or worse than therapy with corticosteroids for induction of immunosuppression after liver transplantation. In specific, we wanted to establish the role of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy as part of corticosteroid-free immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and to find out which type of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy works best with the fewest adverse effects. We systematically searched medical databases (date of last search September 2013) and found 10 randomised clinical trials with 1589 liver transplant recipients, which investigated the use of antibodies compared with corticosteroids for induction in 1589 participants after they had undergone liver transplant. These trials studied antithymocyte globulin and the interleukin-2 receptor antagonists basiliximab and daclizumab. All of these trials had high risk of bias (i.e., risks of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms), which means that the quality of the evidence included in the review is low.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding mortality, graft loss, acute rejection, infection, hepatitis C virus recurrence, malignancy, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. Cytomegalovirus infection was less frequent in patients receiving any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence). This finding was also observed when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence) and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence). However, when trial sequential analysis regarding cytomegalovirus infection was applied, random errors could not be excluded. Furthermore, diabetes mellitus occurred less frequently when T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence), when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence), and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence). When trial sequential analysis was applied, we could exclude random errors regarding a reduction in diabetes mellitus by T-cell specific antibodies compared with corticosteroids.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> As a result of the low quality of the current evidence, the effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain. T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce diabetes mellitus and may reduce cytomegalovirus infection when compared with corticosteroid induction. No other clear benefits or harms were associated with the use of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction. For some analyses, the number of trials investigating the use of T-cell specific antibody induction after liver transplantation is small, and the numbers of participants and outcomes in these randomised trials are limited. Furthermore, the included trials are heterogeneous in nature and have applied different types of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy. All trials were with high risk of bias. Hence, additional high-quality randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction for liver transplant recipients.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 randomised trials with a total of 1589 liver transplant recipients, which studied the use of T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction. All trials were with high risk of bias. We compared any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction in 10 trials with 1589 participants, including interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction versus corticosteroid induction in nine trials with 1470 participants, and polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction in one trial with 119 participants.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Antibodies against T-cells are used to induce immunosuppression after liver transplantation. These antibodies are intended to reduce rejection of the transplanted liver and are given within the first two weeks after transplantation. Furthermore, these antibodies may allow for delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors to protect kidney function.
<ABS> Different types of antibodies have been used: interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (BT563, daclizumab, or basiliximab), monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 receptor (muromonab-CD3) or the CD52 surface protein (alemtuzumab), or polyclonal antibodies of horse or rabbit (antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)). The benefits and harms of these antibodies are unclear.
<ABS> This systematic review aimed to evaluate the use of antibodies against T-cells after liver transplantation. The question is whether T-cell antibody induction has a role after liver transplantation, and which antibody works best with the least number of adverse events.
<ABS> Aim
<ABS> Results
<ABS> From our results we were unable to determine the effects of antibody induction on mortality, graft loss including death, adverse events, infection, CMV infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension for any of the comparisons. Acute rejection may be reduced when any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction and when trial sequential analysis, which we used to control for random errors, was applied. Furthermore, serum creatinine was statistically significantly higher in the T-cell specific antibody induction group compared with the no induction group, as well as in the polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction group compared with the no induction group.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> The effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain because of high risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials, the small number of randomised clinical trials reported, and the limited numbers of participants and outcomes in the trials. T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce acute rejection when compared with no induction. No other clear benefits or harms were associated with the use of any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with no induction, or when compared with another type of T-cell specific antibody. Hence, more randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with placebo, and compared with another type of antibody, for prevention of rejection in liver transplant recipients. Such trials ought to be conducted with low risk of systematic error (bias) and low risk of random error (play of chance).

<H1> Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fentanyl patches placed on the skin produced good pain relief for most people with moderate or severe cancer pain.
<ABS> We found nine studies involving 1244 patients. The studies were often small, used different study designs, and compared fentanyl with many different drugs. Most patients had pain that went from moderate or severe before transdermal fentanyl to no worse than mild pain when using transdermal fentanyl. Only 3 in 10 patients were constipated using transdermal fentanyl compared with 5 in 10 using oral morphine. We could not analyse the data in a meaningful way regarding harmful (adverse) events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease processes.
<ABS> We could wish for more consistency in study design, and especially in study reporting, which should include the outcome of pain reduced to tolerable levels – no worse than mild pain – so that patients with cancer are not bothered by pain.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We could not compare data in a meaningful analysis regarding adverse events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion. These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease process.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Recent studies suggest a connection between a virus (human papillomavirus) and throat cancer (oropharyngeal cancer) in some patients. This review has been conducted to assess potential new treatments that have emerged as a result of this information.
<ABS> When diagnosed, throat cancers can be at an advanced stage and radiotherapy (which uses beams of radiation to kill cancer cells) or chemotherapy (drugs which kill cancer cells) are the most frequently used treatments. Both have side effects and may result in a decreased ability to talk, eat or drink. Newer therapies (biological) are now emerging that will help the immune system to fight cancer.
<ABS> So far, high-quality evidence to assess these new treatment protocols is lacking, but may be available after 2014 as several ongoing studies are completed. Important outcomes to measure will be the likelihood of survival from the various treatments, as well as side effects and quality of life in the longer term. This review will be updated to include this new evidence as it becomes available.
<ABS> This review is currently up to date to June 2013.

<H1> Prostaglandins for management of retained placenta

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Prostaglandins for management of retained placenta

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Medical research evidence is sparse and insufficient to support the routine use of the prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.
<ABS> Retained placenta affects 0.5% to 3% of women following delivery and is a major cause of maternal death caused by postpartum haemorrhage. A retained placenta is usually managed by manual removal or curettage under anaesthesia (which is not always immediately available). Surgical procedures themselves can be associated with haemorrhage and also infection and uterine perforation. Prostaglandins or their analogues, administered by any route, could be an alternative treatment especially in developing countries. Such medical management may facilitate the delivery of the retained placenta and be a safer alternative to surgery.
<ABS> The review identified three randomised controlled studies (involving 244 women) that compared the use of prostaglandins with placebo. Currently there is limited, very low-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness and the safety using prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta. Use of prostaglandins resulted in less need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage and need for blood transfusion but none of the differences reached statistical significance. Much larger, adequately powered studies are needed to confirm that these clinically important beneficial effects are not just chance findings. Similarly, no differences were detected between prostaglandins and placebo in mean blood loss or the mean time from injection to placental removal (minutes). The prostaglandin was administered by intravenous infusion (E2 analogue sulprostone) in one study including 50 women and was orally or sublingually administered (E1 analogue misoprostol) in the other two studies including 194 women.
<ABS> Shivering was more frequent in women receiving the prostaglandin but there were no clear differences in vomiting, headache, maternal pain or nausea compared with placebo. The trials were small and of poor methodological quality. The quality of evidence is very low due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecise results (few women and outcome events with wide confidence intervals). Two studies were stopped early due to an apparent benefit.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three trials, involving 244 women. The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently there is limited, very low-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness and the safety using prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta. Use of prostaglandins resulted in less need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage and blood transfusion but none of the differences reached statistical significance. Much larger, adequately powered studies are needed to confirm that these clinically important beneficial effects are not just chance findings.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Intubation methods for obese patients requiring general anaesthesia


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review is based on five studies involving 1065 women undergoing CS. The studies were of moderate quality. The included studies did not use this review's criteria for diagnosis for UTI, so there are no data for this primary outcome. When considering UTI, as defined by the trial authors, there were no clear differences between groups. There were no data relating to bladder injury during the CS (the review's other primary outcome).
<ABS> Our analysis showed that the use of urinary catheter was associated with less retention of urine after CS. On the other hand, pain/discomfort due to catheterisation or at first voiding after CS, time to ambulate and hospital stay favoured non-use of urinary catheter. There was no difference in the incidence of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony (relaxation of the uterus) after the delivery.
<ABS> The limited evidence in this review is based five trials of moderate quality and results should be considered in this context. There is not enough evidence to assess the routine use of indwelling bladder catheters in women undergoing CS. There is a need for more rigorous research on this topic and future trials should use a standardised criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and other common outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search retrieved 16 studies (from 17 reports). Ten studies were excluded and one study is awaiting assessment. We included five studies involving 1065 women (1090 recruited). The five included studies were at moderate risk of bias.
<RES> Data relating to one of our primary outcomes (UTI) was reported in four studies but did not meet our definition of UTI (as prespecified in our protocol). The included studies did not report on our other primary outcome – intraoperative bladder injury (this outcome was not prespecified in our protocol). Two secondary outcomes were not reported in the included studies: need for postoperative analgesia and women’s satisfaction. The included studies did provide limited data relating to this review’s secondary outcomes.
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheter versus no catheter - three studies (840 women)
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a reduced incidence of bladder distension (non-prespecified outcome) at the end of the operation (risk ratio (RR) 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.35; one study, 420 women) and fewer cases of retention of urine (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47; two studies, 420 women) or need for catheterisation (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16; three studies 840 participants). In contrast, indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a longer time to first voiding (mean difference (MD) 16.81 hours, 95% CI 16.32 to 17.30; one study, 420 women) and more pain or discomfort due to catheterisation (and/or at first voiding) (average RR 10.47, 95% CI 4.71 to 23.25, two studies, 420 women) although high levels of heterogeneity were observed. Similarly, compared to women in the ‘no catheter’ group, indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a longer time to ambulation (MD 4.34 hours, 95% CI 1.37 to 7.31, three studies, 840 women) and a longer stay in hospital (MD 0.62 days, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.10, three studies, 840 women). However, high levels of heterogeneity were observed for these two outcomes and the results should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> There was no difference in postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony. There was also no difference in the incidence of UTI (as defined by trialists) between the indwelling bladder catheterisation and no catheterisation groups (two studies, 570 women). However, high levels of heterogeneity were observed for this non-prespecified outcome and results should be considered in this context.
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheter versus bladder drainage – two studies (225 women)
<RES> Two studies (225 women) compared the use of an indwelling bladder catheter versus bladder drainage. There was no difference between groups in terms of retention of urine following CS, length of hospital stay or the non-prespecified outcome of UTI (as defined by the trialist).
<RES> There is some evidence (from one small study involving 50 women), that the need for catheterisation was reduced in the group of women with an indwelling bladder catheter (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.70) compared to women in the bladder drainage group. Evidence from another small study (involving 175 women) suggests that women who had an indwelling bladder catheter had a longer time to ambulation (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.55) compared to women who received bladder drainage.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A paucity of evidence is available to allow conclusions on whether combined inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are equivalent or superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation (flare-up) state bronchiectasis (Appendix 2).
<ABS> Review question: Is any evidence available to show that combined ICS-LABA is superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation state bronchiectasis in children and adults?
<ABS> Study characteristics: A small, single-centre, non-blinded study that compared inhaled ICS-LABA with high-dose ICS.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: This review is based on a single study, hence the quality of evidence is substantially limited.
<ABS> Bottom line: The decision to use combined ICS-LABA in bronchiectasis must be made for individual patients on the basis of the presence or absence of bronchial hyperreactivity, until further randomised controlled trials are conducted to answer this important question.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> During operations surgeons make a cut (incision) in the skin to gain access to the surgical site. Incisions are closed with sutures (stitches), staples, tissue adhesives or tapes. Sutures can be continuous or interrupted. Continuous sutures are usually inserted underneath the skin surface using absorbable or non-absorbable suture material. Interrupted sutures involve the full thickness of the skin and are usually non-absorbable (but not always).
<ABS> Impaired wound healing increases costs of health care and leads to poor cosmetic results. We investigated whether it is better to use continuous or interrupted sutures to close wounds after non-childbirth surgery by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared these two methods of skin closure (in August 2013).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified five RCTs with a total of 827 participants. Seven hundred thirty participants (384 received continuous sutures and 346 interrupted sutures) provided data for this review. Participants had abdominal or groin operations.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The only outcomes reported were, superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound breakdown and length of hospital stay. No other important outcomes, including quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources, were reported.
<ABS> Approximately 6% of participants developed superficial surgical site infection, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed these. Approximately 4% of participants developed superficial wound breakdown. The proportion of participants with this problem in the continuous suture group was approximately one-tenth of that in the interrupted suture group. Most wound breakdowns occurred in two trials that used absorbable sutures for continuous suturing and non-absorbable sutures for interrupted suturing. Non-absorbable sutures are removed seven to nine days after surgery, but absorbable sutures are not removed, and so support the wound for longer - which may account for the difference in distribution of this problem between groups. There was no significant difference between groups for length of hospital stay.
<ABS> Superficial wound breakdown is reduced by continuous subcuticular suturing. However, the trials that contributed to this result had suture removal in only one group (interrupted sutures), which may have led to this observation. The number of participants included in this review was small and follow-up after surgery was short.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low. Levels of bias across the studies were mostly high or unclear, so there may have been flaws in trial organisation that could produce erroneous results.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five RCTs with a total of 827 participants. Outcomes were available for 730 participants (384 participants randomised to continuous sutures and 346 participants to interrupted sutures). All the trials were of unclear or high risk of bias. The participants underwent abdominal or groin operations. The only outcomes reported in the trials were superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound dehiscence (breakdown) and length of hospital stay. Other important outcomes such as quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources were not reported in these trials.

<H1> Tai chi for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Tai Chi to prevent cardiovascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels that are a worldwide health burden. However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi. This review assessed the effectiveness of tai chi interventions for healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD at reducing cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of tai chi on adults at high risk of developing CVD. We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes). The evidence is current to December 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal endpoints. There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months. Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies. None of the included studies reported on adverse events. Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness of tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 13 small trials (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies). Duration and style of tai chi differed between trials. Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney yin deficiency syndrome.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review considered the question of whether vitamin C may be helpful for people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Details of the way patients were allocated to receive vitamin C or not were not clearly described in 10 of the 11 studies and we considered this carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results. Taking this into account, together with the imprecision of the results, we judged the estimates of the usefulness of vitamin C as a treatment to be of either low or moderate quality in relation to asthma.
<ABS> Additionally, for exercise-induced breathlessness the three studies providing data to the review were small and we are mindful of the need to draw very cautious conclusions about the results.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of December 2012.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 11 trials with 419 participants met our inclusion criteria. In 10 studies the participants were adults and only one was in children. Reporting of study design was inadequate to determine risk of bias for most of the studies and poor availability of data for our key outcomes may indicate some selective outcome reporting. Four studies were parallel-group and the remainder were cross-over studies. Eight studies included people with asthma and three studies included 40 participants with exercise-induced asthma. Five studies reported results using single-dose regimes prior to bronchial challenges or exercise tests. There was marked heterogeneity in vitamin C dosage regimes used in the selected studies, compounding the difficulties in carrying out meaningful analyses.
<RES> Studies in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction suggested some improvement in lung function measures with vitamin C supplementation, but theses studies were few and very small, with limited data and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low.

<H1> Face-to-face interventions for promoting physical activity

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Face-to-face interventions for promoting physical activity


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The issue
<ABS> Women with vulval cancer that has spread to the groin lymph nodes need additional treatment. The standard treatment usually involves surgical removal of as many groin nodes as possible (known as complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL)). However, only about 30% of women with vulval cancer in whom lymph nodes are not obviously enlarged will have groin involvement; therefore, in about 70% of these women additional surgery is not necessary. As groin surgery often causes later swelling of the legs and other unpleasant side effects, it would be preferable not to undergo the surgery if it is not required; therefore, accurate screening tests to determine who should have surgery are needed.
<ABS> Sentinel node assessment involves identifying the main lymph node/s draining the tumour. After the main (sentinel) nodes are identified, they are removed and examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells. Additional surgery depends on the findings of the examination: if cancer cells are found in the nodes, additional surgery is necessary; if the nodes are cancer-free, additional surgery can be avoided.
<ABS> Why is this review important?
<ABS> Several studies have been done using dyes or traceable agents to identify sentinel nodes. From these studies, it is not clear whether all of these agents are sufficiently accurate to predict which women have cancerous spread to the groin. This review summarises the evidence and produces overall estimates of the relative accuracies of the available tests.
<ABS> How was the review conducted?
<ABS> We included all studies that tested the accuracy of tracer agent/s against the standard method of identifying cancer in the groin nodes (removing all groin nodes (IFL) and examining them under a microscope). Women in these studies had vulval cancer of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB or higher without obvious signs of cancer in the groin (enlarged or palpable nodes). We only included studies of at least 10 women, and noted any concerns about the quality of studies.
<ABS> What are the findings?
<ABS> We included 34 studies (1614 women) that evaluated three techniques: blue dye only, technetium (a radioactive substance) only, or blue dye and technetium combined. Ten studies used all three techniques during the course of the study (one technique per participant). There are two attributes to a test: the ability to identify or detect the sentinel node, and the ability to identify the cancer in the sentinel node. We found that all tests can identify cancer in the groin nodes with good accuracy (more than 90% of nodes with cancer will be accurately identified with any of the tests), although the combined test was the most accurate (95%). The ability of the tests to detect sentinel nodes varied, with the blue dye test only detecting sentinel nodes in 82% of women, compared with 98% for the combined test. If sentinel nodes are not detected, they cannot be examined for cancer cells; therefore, women in whom sentinel nodes are not detected will usually need to undergo IFL.
<ABS> What does this mean?
<ABS> The combined and technetium only tests are able to predict accurately which women have cancerous spread to the groin. For a group of 100 women undergoing assessment, the findings mean that approximately one or fewer women having the combined or technetium only tests will undergo an unnecessary IFL, compared with approximately 11 women having the blue dye only test. This is mainly because the blue dye only test is not as good as technetium in identifying sentinel nodes. Fewer women with spread to the groin will be missed with the combined or technetium only tests (1 to 3 out of 30) compared with the blue dye only test (1 to 8 out of 30). It is not clear whether women with negative sentinel nodes (i.e. no spread of cancer to the groin lymph nodes) who do not undergo IFL will live as long as those who undergo IFL. The current best data on survival come from a Dutch study that followed up 259 women with negative sentinel nodes and reported a three-year survival of 97%.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 34 studies evaluating 1614 women and approximately 2396 groins. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate. The studies included in this review used the following traceable techniques to identify sentinel nodes in their participants: blue dye only (three studies), technetium only (eight studies), blue dye plus technetium combined (combined tests; 13 studies) and various inconsistent combinations of these three techniques (mixed tests; 10 studies). For studies of mixed tests, we obtained separate test data where possible.
<RES> Most studies used haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains for the histological examination. Additionally an immunohistochemical (IHC) stain with and without ultrastaging was employed by 14 and eight studies, respectively. One study used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis (CA9 RT-PCR), whilst three studies did not describe the histological methods used.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut, which can affect people anywhere from the mouth to anus. Specific hormones (proteins that transmit instructions in the body) that are known to be involved in pain response may be involved in the inflammation that underlies Crohn’s disease. Perhaps by giving patients a low dose of one of these proteins called naltrexone Crohn’s disease can be improved.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to treated groups) comparing beta-blockers versus other drugs used in the treatment of hypertension. The studies had to include people with thoracic aortic dissection of any cause that had not been treated with surgery. The evidence is current to January 2014.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomized controlled trials.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> As of January 2014, there is no evidence to show that beta-blockers are superior to other antihypertensive medications as a first-line treatment. Randomized control trials are needed to determine the best treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Hyaluronidase for reducing perineal trauma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The potential use of this intervention as a method to reduce perineal trauma are yet to be determined as there was no appropriate established dose for HAase, no evidence of follow-up and side effects, and the number of high-quality trials and outcomes reported was too limited to draw conclusions on its effectiveness and safety. Further rigorous randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of perineal HAase injection in vaginal deliveries.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified six potentially eligible studies. Two studies were excluded. We included four randomised controlled trials that randomised a total of 599 women (data were available for 595 women).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition where the aorta enlarges and can ultimately burst leading to massive internal bleeding. Current guidelines recommend that AAAs ≥ 55 mm should be surgically repaired as at this size the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of surgical repair. AAAs between 30 and 54 mm in size are not as high risk and are generally monitored by regular scans to check for further enlargement. Recent research has shown that even after the aneurysm is repaired, the survival rate in people with AAA is poorer than in people without AAA. In the majority of cases, the cause of death is a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or a stroke. Conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular death. However, both conditions can be reversed through medical treatment. Given the increased risk of mortality with AAA, it is important to determine which medical treatment is most effective in preventing cardiovascular death in people with AAA.
<ABS> In this review, the effectiveness of medical treatment to treat vascular risk factors and reduce cardiovascular deaths and events in people with an AAA was studied. After searching for all relevant studies, one study was found in which a subgroup of 227 people with AAA were randomised to receive the beta-blocker metoprolol or a placebo. The results from the included study were imprecise for all causes of death and death from cardiovascular disease or nonfatal cardiovascular events at 30 days or six months after AAA repair. Adverse drug effects were reported for the whole study population and were not available for the subgroup of participants with AAA. The study was deemed to be at a generally low risk of bias.
<ABS> Research with larger and longer duration trials is needed to determine which treatment is most effective. At present people with AAA are offered a wide range of pharmacological treatment including antiplatelet drugs, antihypertensives and lipid-lowering drugs. Future trials should test available drugs to find the most effective strategy, whether that be one single drug or a combination of treatments. In addition, the acceptability of such interventions needs to be assessed and future studies should measure adverse side effects associated with these drugs and their impact on quality of life.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Although two review authors independently checked 1311 articles identified by searching, we found no relevant studies that were suitable for inclusion in the review. Therefore, no evidence is currently available from which to determine whether exenterative surgery is better than, equivalent to or worse than non-surgical treatment in terms of prolonged survival, treatment-related complications and impact on quality of life. This review highlights the need for good-quality studies comparing exenterative surgery versus non-surgical treatment in women with recurrent gynaecological cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform the surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is costly, time consuming, and is of variable effectiveness. Laparoscopic surgery involves use of instruments using key-hole incisions and is generally considered more difficult than open surgery. Training using box models (physical simulation) is an option to supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training. The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. We sought to answer the question of whether the box model training is useful in such trainees in terms of improving technical outcomes by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised clinical trials. Randomised clinical trials are commonly called randomised controlled trials and are the best study design to answer such questions. If conducted well, they provide the most accurate answers to questions about intervention effects. Two authors searched the medical literature available to May 2013 and obtained the information from the identified trials. The use of two authors decreases the errors in obtaining the information.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified and included seven trials in which 249 surgical trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience received either box model training in addition to their standard apprenticeship training (122 trainees) versus standard apprenticeship training alone (127 trainees). The choice of whether the trainees received supplementary box model training was made in a random method similar to the toss of a coin. Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada. After supplementary box model training or standard training, the performance of the trainees was evaluated on their first operation after supplementary box model training and during the first operation in humans after an equivalent time after standard training. Different trials assessed the performance in different operations and all these operations were minor to moderate operations.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Only one trial including 50 trainees was at low risk of bias (no risk of arriving at wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the researchers). Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials with less risk of bias because of poor study design or because of chance are necessary. Such trials should assess the long-term impact of box model training on clinical outcomes.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> None of the trials compared box model training versus animal model training or versus different methods of box model training.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform the surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon. This is costly, time consuming, and is of variable effectiveness. Laparoscopic surgery involves the use of instruments using a key-hole incision and is generally considered more difficult than open surgery. Training using box models (physical simulation) is an option to supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training. The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with no prior laparoscopic experience is unknown. We sought to determine whether the box model training is useful in such trainees in terms of improving technical outcomes by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised clinical trials. Randomised clinical trials are commonly called randomised controlled trials and are the best study design to answer such questions. If conducted well, they provide the most accurate answer. Two review authors searched the medical literature available to May 2013 and obtained the information from the identified trials. The use of two review authors to identify studies and obtain information decreases the errors in obtaining the information. We identified and included 25 trials in the review.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The trials compared box model training versus no training (16 trials; 464 participants) or versus different types of box model training (14 trials; 382 participants) (some trials and participants were included in both comparisons as the trials compared different methods of box training versus no training).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The primary outcomes investigated in this review were time taken to perform task, error score, accuracy score, and a composite (total summed) performance score. Box model training appears to decrease the time required to perform a laparoscopic task, improve the accuracy, decrease the errors, and improves the overall performance. This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery. There does not appear to be any significant differences in different methods of box model training. The impact of the improved surgical skills on patients or healthcare funders in terms of improved health or decreased costs is unknown.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All but one of the trials were of high risk of bias (defects in study design that can lead to arriving at incorrect conclusions with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms). Furthermore, our results are prone to risks of random errors. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials with less risk of bias because of poor study design or because of chance are necessary.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review. All but one trial were at high risk of bias. Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants). All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers. Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training. There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PLD is an improved formulation of an anticancer drug that has been around since the 1960s. When used with carboplatin (carbo), it has been shown to improve survival in women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) that has come back (relapsed) six months or longer after the last platinum (carbo)-based treatment.
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> We wanted to find out whether PLD was also useful for the treatment of newly diagnosed EOC. We searched the literature from 1990 to January 2013 for relevant studies and included two studies in this review.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> One study compared PLD plus carbo given to women every three weeks versus the standard treatment (paclitaxel (PAC)/carbo every three weeks), and the other added PLD to the standard treatment and compared it with standard treatment only (the latter study also included other treatments not relevant to this review). These studies spanned three years and included 820 and 4100 women, respectively. Most women in these studies had advanced cancer and had undergone surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> Adding PLD to standard treatment (PAC/carbo) every six weeks did not help women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer survive longer and was associated with worse effects on blood counts that increased the chance of infection; therefore this triple drug treatment cannot be recommended.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We considered the evidence related to survival of women after they are treated with PLD/carbo or PAC/carbo, and the evidence related to adverse drug effects to be of high quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two large trials. One trial compared three-weekly PLD and carboplatin (PLD/carbo) with PAC/carbo. The other trial included four experimental arms, one of which was PLD plus PAC/carbo, that were compared with the standard PAC/carbo regimen. We did not combine results of these two trials in the meta-analysis. We considered the two studies to be at low risk of bias.
<RES> For the comparison PLD/carbo versus PAC/carbo (820 women; stages Ic to IV), no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 1.19) or overall survival (OS) (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13) were noted between study arms. Severe anaemia (risk ratio [RR] 2.74, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.88) and thrombocytopenia (RR 8.09, 95% CI 3.93 to 16.67) were significantly more common with PLD/carbo, whereas alopecia (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) and severe neurotoxicity (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.66) were significantly more common with PAC/carbo. Quality of life scores were not significantly different.
<RES> No RCTs evaluated single-agent PLD for first-line treatment of EOC.

<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules in adults.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A thyroid nodule is a swelling within the thyroid gland and is a common clinical problem detected in 20% to 70% of people. Thyroid nodules can cause pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints. Treatment for benign thyroid nodules includes thyroid hormone therapy, surgery, radioiodine treatment, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and laser or radiofrequency treatment to shrink nodules. Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used as alternatives to drug treatment.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We could identify only one randomised controlled trial involving 152 participants with benign thyroid nodules. The intervention group (98 participants) was treated with a combination of two Chinese herbal medicines, and no treatment was given to the control group (54 participants). The duration of treatment was three months, and overall follow-up six months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The included study did not investigate nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health-related quality of life; all-cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; or socioeconomic effects. Thyroid hormone levels were normal in both groups before and after the study was conducted. No adverse events were reported.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the included study was unclear or low.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of April 2013.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Lifestyle interventions for acute gout

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of lifestyle modifications in the treatment of people with acute gout. There was one study included in this review, which looked at the benefits and safety of adding topical ice therapy to medications commonly used for treating acute gout (prednisolone and colchicine). Over a one week period, in addition to prednisolone and colchicine, ice was applied to the skin overlying the joints affected by acute gout, for half-an-hour, four times per day, to relieve symptoms of pain and warmth and to reduce signs of redness and swelling.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with acute gout:
<ABS> We are uncertain whether the reduction in pain seen with the addition of topical ice to standard treatment of prednisolone and colchicine, compared to prednisolone and colchicine alone, is a true effect because of the very low quality evidence.
<ABS> Joint function, health-related quality of life, patient global assessment and side effects and complications were not reported.
<ABS> We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications. Topical ice is likely to be a safe intervention.
<ABS> What is gout and what are lifestyle interventions?
<ABS> Gout is a very common cause of painful joint inflammation (arthritis) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints. The inflammation can lead to pain, redness, warmth and swelling of the affected joints, making the area difficult to touch or move. Some of the reasons why people get gout include their genetic make-up, being overweight, ingesting certain medications (for example cyclosporine), having impaired kidney function, and lifestyle habits such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and sugar-sweetened drinks.
<ABS> Medications are the mainstay of acute gout treatment. Given the recognised association between certain lifestyle risk factors and gout development, lifestyle changes such as consuming more water, coffee, dairy milk and cherry juice, and having fewer sugar-sweetened drinks, alcoholic beverages, meat and seafood are commonly recommended to people with chronic gout to prevent recurrence of attacks.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with acute gout using topical ice in addition to medications:
<ABS> Joint pain (lower score means less pain)
<ABS> People who used topical ice (for half-an-hour, four times per day for one week) in addition to medical treatment (oral prednisolone and colchicine) rated their pain 3.33 points lower on a 0 to 10 point pain scale (33% absolute improvement).- People who used topical ice in addition to medical treatment (prednisolone and colchicine) rated their pain to be 2.25 points on a scale of 0 to 10.- People who used medical treatment alone rated their pain to be 5.58 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - Three people would need to be treated with topical ice for one person to benefit from pain relief.
<ABS> Adverse events
<ABS> Side effects or complications of using topical ice in addition to medical therapy were not reported in the study.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In this review, the combination of pelvic floor muscle training with another active treatment was compared with the same active treatment alone for the treatment of all types of urine leakage. There was not enough evidence say whether or not the addition of pelvic floor muscle training to another active treatment results in more benefits when compared to the same active treatment alone. There was also insufficient evidence to evaluate the adverse events associated with the addition of PFMT to other active treatment.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials met the eligibility criteria for inclusion, comprising women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), and they compared PFMT added to another active treatment (494 women) with the same active treatment alone (490 women). The pre-specified comparisons were reported by single trials except electrical stimulation which was reported by two trials. However, the two trials reporting electrical stimulation could not be pooled as one of the trials did not report any relevant data. We considered the included trials to be at unclear risk of bias for most of the domains, predominantly due to the lack of adequate information in a number of trials. This affected our rating of the quality of evidence. 
<RES> With regard to condition-specific quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between women (with SUI, UUI or MUI) who received PFMT added to bladder training and those who received bladder training alone at three months after treatment either on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Revised scale (mean difference (MD) -5.90, 95% CI -35.53 to 23.73) or on the Urogenital Distress Inventory scale (MD -18.90, 95% CI -37.92 to 0.12). A similar pattern of results was observed between women with SUI who received PFMT plus either a continence pessary or duloxetine and those who received the continence pessary or duloxetine alone. In all these comparisons, the quality of the evidence for the reported critical outcomes ranged from moderate to very low.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed evidence about the effect of immune tolerance induction to remove inhibitors in people with haemophilia A and B.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Trial characteristics
<ABS> We found one randomised trial that compared high- and low-dose immune tolerance induction, which included 115 males with haemophilia A and inhibitors.
<ABS> Key results and conclusions
<ABS> The single included trial was too small to be certain that both doses of immune tolerance induction were equally successful at removing inhibitors. However, the high-dose treatment destroyed all inhibitors faster and with less bleeding events than the low-dose treatment. Since there was only one available trial, further trials are needed to establish the best immune tolerance induction regimen with respect to starting time, dosing intensity and frequency.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One methodologically sound randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review. One further randomised controlled trial has been recently stopped, but it has not yet been reported.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions). Characteristics of the illness are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions. People with schizophrenia may also find it difficult to find employment, make friends and socialise with other people.
<ABS> Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by focusing on people’s thoughts, emotions and behaviours and by challenging strange or dysfunctional thoughts. CBT was originally developed to help people with psychological disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. More recently it has been used to help people with psychosis (CBTp). Working with a therapist, people establish links between their thoughts, feelings or actions. They are encouraged to re-evaluate their beliefs, perceptions and reasoning as well as to monitor their own thoughts, feelings, behaviours and symptoms. CBTp is suggested to provide alternative ways of coping with strange thoughts and the symptoms of schizophrenia, which should reduce distress and improve people’s functioning.
<ABS> Standard CBTp tends to involve around 16 sessions (12 to 20 sessions) over 4 to 6 months, while brief CBTp involves around 6 to 10 sessions, in less than 4 months.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to compare two types of CBTp, brief CBTp and standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia. A search was run for relevant randomised studies in 2013. Only seven potentially-relevant studies were found. However, although all of them randomised people with schizophrenia, none of these studies compared brief CBTp with standard CBTp. In the main they compared brief CBTp with standard care or other therapies. There is, therefore, no information or literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for schizophrenia and psychosis.
<ABS> There is a need for large scale research and trials that compare brief CBTp with standard CBTp. This research needs to evaluate costs, have clear definitions of standard and brief CBTp and focus on the time period or number of sessions, i.e. the ‘effective dose’ of CBTp.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Unprotected sex can result in disease and death in many areas of the world, due to sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV. The male condom is one of the oldest birth control methods and the earliest method that works to prevent HIV. When used correctly, condoms can provide dual protection against pregnancy and HIV/STI. We examined behavioral programs to improve condom use.
<ABS> Through September 2013, we did computer searches for studies of programs to improve condom use. We wrote to researchers for missing data. The studies could have various designs. The education program addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI. The intervention was compared with a different program, usual care, or no intervention. The studies had a clinical outcome such as pregnancy, HIV, or STI tests. We did not use self-reports of condom use.
<ABS> We found seven randomized trials. Six assigned groups (clusters) and one randomized individuals. Four trials took place in African countries, two in the USA, and one in England. The studies were based in schools, community settings, a clinic, and a military training setting.
<ABS> Five trials examined pregnancy, four studied HIV and HSV-2 (herpes), and three assessed other STI. We found no major differences between study groups for pregnancy or HIV. Some results were seen for STI outcomes. Two studies showed fewer HSV-2 cases with the behavioral program compared to the control group. One also reported fewer cases of syphilis and gonorrhea with the behavioral program plus STI management. Another study reported a higher gonorrhea rate for the intervention group. The researchers believed the result was due to a subgroup that did not have the full program.
<ABS> We found little clinical effect of improving condom use. The studies provided moderate to low quality information. Losses to follow up were high. We need good programs on condom use to prevent pregnancy and HIV/STI. Programs should be useful for settings with few resources. Interventions should be tested with valid outcome measures.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies met our eligibility criteria. All were randomized controlled trials; six assigned clusters and one randomized individuals. Sample sizes for the cluster-randomized trials ranged from 2157 to 15,614; the number of clusters ranged from 18 to 70. Four trials took place in African countries, two in the USA, and one in England. Three were based mainly in schools, two were in community settings, one took place during military training, and one was clinic-based.

<H1> Micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV infection

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Further research is needed on single supplements other than vitamin A, and on the long-term effects, optimal composition and dosing of multiple supplements.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three new studies in addition to the eight studies in the earlier version of the review (Irlam 2010). Eleven studies with a total of 2412 participants were therefore included: five trials of vitamin A, one trial of vitamin D, two trials of zinc, and three trials of multiple micronutrient supplements. All except one trial were conducted in African children.
<RES> Vitamin A halved all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis of three trials in African children, had inconsistent impacts on diarrhoeal and respiratory morbidity, and improved short-term growth in a Tanzanian trial. No significant adverse effects were reported.
<RES> A single small trial of vitamin D in North American adolescents and children demonstrated safety but no clinical benefits. Zinc supplements reduced diarrhoeal morbidity and had no adverse effects on disease progression in one small South African trial. Another trial in South African children with and without HIV infection did not show benefit from the the prophylactic use of zinc or multiple supplements versus vitamin A in the small subgroup of children with HIV infection.
<RES> Multiple micronutrient supplements at twice the RDA did not alter mortality, growth, or CD4 counts at 12 months in Ugandan children aged one to five years. Short-term supplementation until hospital discharge significantly reduced the duration of all hospital admissions in poorly nourished South African children, and supplementation for six months after discharge improved appetite and nutritional indicators.

<H1> Adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced endometrial cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chemotherapy after surgery for stage III and IV endometrial cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The issue: Advanced endometrial cancer (FIGO stage III and IV) is cancer of the womb which has spread beyond the womb to the ovaries, vagina, other adjacent tissues, draining lymph nodes, or other organs. Women are usually treated by surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. They are then offered adjuvant (meaning 'added') radiotherapy (high energy x-rays and other rays that destroy cancer cells), or chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs), or both. There is uncertainty as to which treatment (radio- or chemotherapy or both) after surgery has the greatest effect on survival, and which anti-cancer drugs work best.
<ABS> The aim of the review: We aimed to determine whether chemotherapy after surgery is effective compared to radiotherapy, in women with advanced cancer of the womb.
<ABS> How was the review conducted?
<ABS> We searched the literature from 1966 to November 2013 for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included four RCTs which were at low to moderate risk of bias and involved 1269 women. We wrote to the investigators of three trials for unpublished data. Three of the four trials compared similar interventions (chemotherapy versus radiotherapy after surgery). We pooled survival data (including the unpublished data) from two trials and await unpublished data for the third trial. The fourth trial compared two types of chemotherapy treatments after all women had received surgery and radiotherapy.
<ABS> What are the main findings? Women who received chemotherapy after surgery (starting within eight weeks of surgery) survived approximately 25% longer than those receiving radiotherapy after surgery. Assuming that 60% of women with stage III endometrial cancer usually survive at least five years after surgery and radiotherapy, this would increase to 75% if they receive surgery and chemotherapy instead, depending on other risk factors, such as age. The risk of death which might have been caused by treatment was low with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy but we could not be sure if one was more harmful than the other. Chemotherapy may be associated with more side-effects (low blood counts, nerve damage and hair loss) compared with radiotherapy.
<ABS> In the trial that compared two different chemotherapy treatments, there was no clear evidence that using three anti-cancer drugs was better than using two. However, the final overall survival results of this trial have not yet been reported. Severe side-effects were much more common in women treated with three anti-cancer drugs than two drugs.
<ABS> What are the conclusions? Chemotherapy appears to be more effective than radiotherapy after surgery for women with stage III and IV endometrial cancer but may cause more side-effects. More research is needed to determine whether the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy improves outcomes and which anti-cancer drugs are best.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four multicentre RCTs involving 1269 women with primary FIGO stage III/IV endometrial cancer. We considered the trials to be at low to moderate risk of bias. All participants received primary cytoreductive surgery. Two trials, evaluating 620 women (83% stage III, 17% stage IV), compared adjuvant chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy; one trial evaluating 552 women (88% stage III, 12% stage IV) compared two chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin/doxorubicin/paclitaxel (CDP) versus cisplatin/doxorubicin (CD) treatment) in women who had all undergone adjuvant radiotherapy; and one trial contributed no data.
<RES> Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant radiotherapy (OS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.99, I² = 22%; and PFS: HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92, I² = 0%). Sensitivity analysis using adjusted and unadjusted OS data, gave similar results. In subgroup analyses, the effects on survival in favour of chemotherapy were not different for stage III and IV, or stage IIIA and IIIC (tests for subgroup differences were not significant and I² = 0%). This evidence was of moderate quality. Data from one trial showed that women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to experience haematological and neurological adverse events and alopecia, and more likely to discontinue treatment (33/194 versus 6/202; RR 5.73, 95% CI 2.45 to 13.36), than those receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference in treatment-related deaths between the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment arms (8/309 versus 5/311; Risk Ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 5.00).
<RES> There was no clear difference in PFS between intervention groups in the one trial that compared CDP versus CD (552 women; HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.17). We considered this evidence to be of moderate quality. Mature OS data from this trial were not yet available. Severe haematological and neurological adverse events occurred more frequently with CDP than CD.
<RES> We found no trials to include of adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation in advanced endometrial cancer; however we identified one ongoing trial of this comparison.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified nine trials with 617 participants that met our inclusion criteria. However, we were only able to include 496 participants randomised to seven different treatment strategies from seven trials in our network meta-analysis because of the complex statistical methodology that we used.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was an increase in the proportion of people with major complications when the liver was divided using radiofrequency as compared with using standard surgical instruments. Major complications developed in approximately 25% of people undergoing liver resection using radiofrequency. In comparison, one in 15 people (7%) undergoing liver resection by standard method developed major complications. There was modest reduction in blood loss and number of units of blood transfused when continuous vascular occlusion was used compared with no vascular occlusion or intermittent vascular occlusion. Liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion took about 50 minutes longer than liver resection performed with no vascular occlusion when the liver was divided using ultrasound. Quality of life and time needed to return to work were not reported in any of the trials. The differences in the other outcomes and other comparisons that were not mentioned above were imprecise.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All the trials were at high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the studies were conducted. The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We are unable to determine the comparative benefits and harms of different methods of liver resection. Liver resection using radiofrequency energy should be further assessed in randomised clinical trials in order to understand its safety profile better. The risk of serious adverse events following liver resection using no special equipment compared with more complex methods requiring special equipment is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. However, there is considerable uncertainty about this and large benefits or harms with a specific method of liver resection cannot be ruled out.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The differences in the proportion of people requiring blood transfusion was imprecise (six trials; seven treatments; 446 participants). Two trials (three treatments; 155 participants) provided data for quantity of blood transfused. People undergoing liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion had higher amounts of blood transfused than people with continuous vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with the clamp-crush method and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD 1.2 units; 95% CrI 0.08 to 2.32). The differences in the other comparisons were imprecise (very low quality evidence). Three trials (four treatments; 281 participants) provided data for operative blood loss. People undergoing liver resection using continuous vascular occlusion had lower blood loss than people with no vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with clamp-crush method and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD -130.9 mL; 95% CrI -255.9 to -5.9). None of the trials reported the proportion of people with major blood loss.
<RES> The differences in the length of hospital stay (six trials; seven treatments; 446 participants) and intensive therapy unit stay (four trials; six treatments; 261 participants) were imprecise. Four trials (four treatments; 245 participants) provided data for operating time. Liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion took longer than liver resection performed with no vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD 49.6 minutes; 95% CrI 29.8 to 69.4). The differences in the operating time between the other comparisons were imprecise. None of the trials reported the time needed to return to work.

<H1> Oxycodone for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Oxycodone for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Oxycodone is used to treat acute and some forms of chronic pain, and so might be a useful medicine for neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.
<ABS> In 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials in which oxycodone was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. We found three studies of modest quality that tested oxycodone against placebo for several weeks. Almost all of the 254 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes.
<ABS> Oxycodone was not convincingly shown to help relieve the pain (very low quality evidence). Compared with placebo, fewer people stopped taking oxycodone because they felt it was not effective, but more people experienced adverse effects (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Oxycodone has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. No studies have examined its use in other types of neuropathic pain, or in fibromyalgia.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of oxycodone for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three studies with 254 participants; 204 had painful diabetic neuropathy and 50 postherpetic neuralgia. Study size ranged from 45 to 159 participants. Two studies used a cross-over design and one a parallel group design; study duration was four or six weeks. Controlled release oxycodone (oxycodone CR) was used in all three studies, with doses titrated up to a maximum of between 60 and 120 mg daily; mean doses achieved ranged between 37 and 45 mg daily. All studies used a placebo comparator, although in one study, an active placebo (benztropine) was used. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias.
<RES> No study reported the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief or who were very much improved, while one reported the proportion with at least 30% pain relief, two reported at least moderate pain relief, and one reported the number of participants who considered treatment to be moderately effective. No study provided first or second tier evidence for an efficacy outcome. Third tier evidence indicated greater pain intensity reduction and better patient satisfaction with oxycodone than with placebo in all three studies, but such evidence was derived mainly from group mean data, with last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation or completer analysis, in small studies lasting less than eight weeks (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Adverse events were more common with oxycodone CR than with placebo. At least one adverse event was experienced by 86% of participants taking oxycodone CR and 63% taking placebo, and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful effect (NNH) was 4.3. The effect of oxycodone on serious adverse events reported was uncertain in comparison with placebo (oxycodone 3.4% versus placebo: 7.0%; RR 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.23; very low quality evidence); one death was reported with oxycodone CR, but was not attributed to treatment. Adverse event withdrawals did not differ significantly between groups, occurring in 11% of participants with oxycodone CR and 6.4% with placebo (RR 1.69 (0.83 to 3.43); very low quality evidence). Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were less frequent with oxycodone CR (1.1%) than placebo (11%), with an NNT to prevent one withdrawal of 10 (RR 0.12 (0.03 to 0.45); very low quality evidence).
<RES> We found no relevant studies in chronic neuropathic pain conditions other than painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia, or in fibromyalgia.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Blood thinners for pulmonary hypertension

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The heart has four chambers: two upper and two lower chambers. The lower right chamber, also known as the right ventricle, pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where the blood receives oxygen. Pulmonary hypertension occurs when pressure in the pulmonary arteries is increased to above normal (8 to 25 mmHg). When this happens over time, inflammation of the pulmonary artery occurs. The arteries may then become stiff and tighten. These changes make it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. The heart becomes weaker as it tries to push against this pressure; the resulting disturbance to blood flow can lead to blood clots. These clots can travel to the lungs, which can worsen the person's condition and may result in death.
<ABS> People with pulmonary hypertension may complain of tiredness, chest pain and shortness of breath during normal activities like walking and running, which may progress to affect all physical activities. Prospects of survival depend on several factors, but pregnancy is strongly associated with poor survival.
<ABS> Treatment of this disease is multi-faceted and includes rehabilitation, psychosocial support and surgical and medical treatment. Medical treatment includes the use of blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban. Blood thinners work by preventing the formation of clot. The blood thinner of choice, warfarin, needs close monitoring with daily to weekly laboratory testing to maintain the therapeutic target; this monitoring may be difficult to keep up with. The major side effect of blood thinners is bleeding, which can manifest as easy bruising, bleeding in the digestive tract and bleeding into the brain; severe cases can be fatal.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of blood thinners in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. No eligible studies (randomised controlled trials) were found. Review of other studies (non-randomised controlled trials) shows the effectiveness of this intervention. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of evidence provided by these studies.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> No randomised evidence is available. We decided to look at the results of other studies (non-randomised control trials). They provide only poor quality evidence of effectiveness of this intervention, and the results should be interpreted with caution. We are uncertain as to how far the results of studies with this design can be believed, and our own approach was not designed to properly look for them and incorporate them in our systematic review. This review therefore highlights the need for appropriately designed randomised controlled trials.

<H1> Anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of research about the effects of anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) on fibromyalgia (FM). After searching for all relevant studies, they found eight studies with up to 3579 people. The anticonvulsants that they studied were gabapentin, lacosamide, levetiracetam and pregabalin. They found reliable conclusions for pregabalin only.
<ABS> Key results: pregabalin compared with fake medication after an average of 13 weeks
<ABS> - Pregabalin slightly reduces pain and sleep problems.- Pregabalin slightly reduces fatigue.- Pregabalin increases medication side effects, in particular dizziness.- Pregabalin does not differ from fake medication in serious side effects.
<ABS> Possible side effects may include drowsiness, weight gain, swelling in the legs, blurred vision and co-ordination problems. Rare complications may include angio-oedema (swelling that happens just below the surface of the skin, most often around the lips and eyes), allergies and diseases of the immune system, worsening of heart failure, impairment of a person's ability to drive or operate machinery, and abuse or dependency on pregabalin. Serious side effects, such as suicidal thoughts, are very rare.
<ABS> What is FM and what are anticonvulsants?
<ABS> People with FM suffer from chronic widespread pain, sleep problems and fatigue. There is no cure for FM at present. Treatments aim at relieving the symptoms and improving quality of life.
<ABS> Anticonvulsants are medications which help people with epileptic seizures. Neurons are cells that send messages to the brain. For example some neurons send messages about light, sound or touch to the brain. If something goes wrong and the neurons send too many messages quickly, then people may feel pain more strongly. Anticonvulsants can help slow the neurons down in the spinal cord and the brain. Some anticonvulsants can reduce pain and sleep problems in chronic pain due to nerve damage and can stabilize mood in people with anxiety and depressive disorders. People with fibromyalgia can have more brain activity and stronger reactions to the stimulus from their senses, so anticonvulsants might help with that. Pregabalin is approved for use in FM patients in most countries of North and South America and Asia, but not in Europe.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with FM when they take pregabalin
<ABS> Pain:
<ABS> - 9 more people out of 100 who took pregabalin reached 50% or greater pain reduction than people who took fake medication (9% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 23 out of 100 people had their pain reduced by 50% or greater when they took pregabalin compared with 14 out of 100 people when they took a fake medication.
<ABS> Global improvement:
<ABS> - 11 more people out of 100 who took pregabalin improved 'much' and 'very much' globally than people who took fake medication (12% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 39 out of 100 people improved 'much' and 'very much' globally when they took pregabalin compared with 28 out of 100 people when they took a fake medication.
<ABS> Fatigue (measured on a 1 to 50 scale):
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin reported a slight reduction of fatigue (2.7% absolute improvement) than people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin rated their fatigue as 34.6 compared with 35.6 in people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> Sleep problems (measured on a 0 to 100 scale):
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin reported a reduction of sleep problems (6.2% absolute improvement) than people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin rated their sleep problems to be 54.9 compared with 58.6 in people who took fake medication
<ABS> Stopping medication due to side effects:
<ABS> - 7 more people out of 100 stopped pregabalin compared with fake medication because of side effects (8% absolute deterioration).
<ABS> - 18 people out of 100 who took anticonvulsants stopped medication due to side effects compared with 11 people out of 100 who took a fake medication.
<ABS> Serious side effects:
<ABS> - There were no differences between pregabalin (5.2%) and fake medication (4.1%) in the number of serious adverse events.
<ABS> Dizziness:
<ABS> - 24 more people out of 100 reported dizziness as a side effect of pregabalin (28% absolute deterioration).
<ABS> - 35 people out of 100 who took pregabalin reported dizziness as a side effect compared with 11 people out of 100 who took a fake medication.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the benefits and harms of anticonvulsants for treating FM symptoms.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included eight studies: five with pregabalin and one study each with gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam. A total of 2480 people were included into anticonvulsants groups and 1099 people in placebo groups. The median therapy phase of the studies was 13 weeks. The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM. The amount and quality of evidence was sufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in FM. Therefore,

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Screening for peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review found no randomised controlled trial evidence on screening for PAD. High quality research is required to help healthcare providers decide whether screening for PAD in asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals is effective in terms of reduction of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (for example myocardial infarction and stroke), morbidity from PAD (intermittent claudication, amputation, reduced walking distance) and improvement in quality of life.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this question important?
<ABS> Inhaled drugs for COPD have been shown to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and prevent or treat flare-ups. Treatment with these inhaled drugs tends to begin with one inhaler, and additional therapies are introduced as necessary. For persistent or worsening symptoms, long-acting inhaled drugs taken once or twice daily are preferred over short-acting ones. Several Cochrane reviews have looked at the risks and benefits of specific long-acting inhaled therapies compared with placebo or other treatments. However for patients and clinicians, it is important to understand the benefits of these treatments relative to each other, and whether a particular type of inhaled therapy is more beneficial than the others.
<ABS> How did we answer the question?
<ABS> We looked for studies in existing Cochrane reviews and performed detailed electronic searches up to September 2013. Studies were included if they lasted at least six months and compared any of the following treatments versus any other for people with COPD: long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs—formoterol, indacaterol, salmeterol); long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs—aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium); inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs—budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone); combination long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS—formoterol/budesonide, formoterol/mometasone, salmeterol/fluticasone); and placebo.
<ABS> We conducted a network meta-analysis to assess the benefits of each type of treatment (e.g. long-acting beta2-agonists) relative to the others for quality of life and lung function. We also looked at how much individual treatments varied (e.g. How different were the three inhaled steroids from one other?) and whether particular treatments were more effective than others. We assessed the data for six months and 12 months separately and reported six months as the primary findings.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> We found 71 relevant studies, but not all measured the outcomes we were interested in. Forty-two studies were included in the quality of life analyses (measured on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and 46 were included in the lung function analyses.
<ABS> Evidence from good quality and similar trials supported LABA/ICS combinations as the most likely treatment strategy to bring the greatest improvement to quality of life and lung function. Combination therapy gave an average benefit of 3.9 units over placebo at six months. LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months (-2.63 and -2.29 units, respectively), especially when unreliable trials were not included, but a large degree of overlap in the estimates was noted.
<ABS> Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class for trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with mean improvement over placebo of 133 mL at six months (95% credible Interval (CrI) 101 to 164). As was the case for SGRQ, LAMAs (mean difference (MD) 104, 95% CrI 82 to 125) were ranked just ahead of LABAs (MD 99, 95% CrI 72 to 128) at six months, and ICSs were the lowest ranked class (MD 65, 95% CrI 33 to 97).
<ABS> For both outcomes, the effects of LABA and ICS used alone appeared to increase when used together for six months, but initial differences between the treatment classes were less obvious after a year of treatment.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and 12 months. Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months. The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1 that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been shown by other reviews) require consideration. Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pharmacological therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is aimed at relieving symptoms, improving quality of life and preventing or treating exacerbations.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> As part of this network meta-analysis, we will address the following issues.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> To justify the analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and methodological transitivity across comparisons. We tested the robustness of our analyses by performing sensitivity analyses for lack of blinding and by considering six- and 12-month data separately.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 71 RCTs randomly assigning 73,062 people with COPD to 184 treatment arms of interest. Trials were similar with regards to methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria and key baseline characteristics. Participants were more often male, aged in their mid sixties, with FEV1 predicted normal between 40% and 50% and with substantial smoking histories (40+ pack-years). The risk of bias was generally low, although missing information made it hard to judge risk of selection bias and selective outcome reporting. Fixed effects were used for SGRQ analyses, and random effects for Trough FEV1 analyses, based on model fit statistics and deviance information criteria (DIC).

<H1> Surgical treatment of stage IA2 cervical cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Surgical treatment of stage IA2 cervical cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide. Cervical cancer is staged (classified using a universally adopted system called International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging) according to how advanced the disease is and whether the cancer has spread beyond the cervix. Stage I cervical cancer is confined to the cervix. Stage I is divided into stage IA and IB. Stage IA is the earliest stage of cervical cancer where the cancer is so small it cannot be seen with the naked eye. Stage IA is subdivided further to stages IA1 and IA2. Stage IA2 means the cancer has grown between 3 and 5 mm into the cervical tissues, but it is still less than 7 mm wide.
<ABS> It is well recognised that survival rates from the disease decrease as the stage at which the diagnosis is made increases. In women with stage IA2 cervical cancer it has been reported that between 95% and 98% survived five years after diagnosis with standard surgery.
<ABS> For stage IA2 disease, surgery or radiotherapy have been the treatment of choice. Standard surgery is a radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. It involves the removal of the womb, the cervix, the upper part of the vagina and the tissues around the cervix (parametrial tissue), as well as the lymph nodes (glands) in the pelvis (pelvic lymphadenectomy). Although this type of surgery has excellent results, it can result in side effects, such as organ injury (bladder, bowel, blood vessel, nerve) and long-term side effects, such as sexual or bladder dysfunction, pelvic cyst formation and lymphoedema (swelling) of the legs. One main disadvantage of radical hysterectomy is that it leaves the woman incapable of bearing children. As cervical cancer is common in women aged 25 to 35 years, this is an important consideration for many women.
<ABS> The alternative surgical treatment is a radical trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. Radical trachelectomy involves removing the cervix, the upper part of the vagina and the parametrial tissue and the pelvic lymph glands, but retaining the body of the womb. This treatment is well established and appears to be safe and effective in preserving fertility and has a high chance of conception. Late miscarriage and premature labour are the most serious side effects in pregnancies where the woman has had a trachelectomy.
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> This review aimed to assess less invasive types of surgery such as simple hysterectomy, conisation (removal of the central cervical tissue) with or without pelvic lymphadenectomy for women with stage IA2 disease. We searched the literature from 1966 to September 2013. We then checked 982 titles and abstracts, but found no relevant completed clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria only one on-going trial.
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We identified one large ongoing, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT, a study in which women are allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive one of two treatments: standard versus less radical treatment) that looked at this subject. The results of this trial will be published in the future.
<ABS> Currently there is absence of evidence that any form of surgical technique is better, equal or worse in prolonging survival, improving quality of life or are associated with fewer side effects. The review highlights the need to assess, once completed, the results of the ongoing RCT in order to compare different types of surgery.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A number of policy directives are aimed at enabling people with drug problems to live healthy, crime-free lives. Drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems represent a group of people who access treatment for a variety of different reasons. The complexity of the two problems makes the treatment and rehabilitation of this group of people particularly challenging.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched scientific databases and internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (where participants are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) of interventions to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse or criminal activity of drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental illness. We included people of any gender, age or ethnicity.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this question important?
<ABS> Asthma is a long-term condition that causes coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. When symptoms significantly worsen, often referred to as an attack or 'exacerbation,' this can be life threatening. Management of exacerbations in the emergency department (ED) varies, and some guidelines recommend the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) when other treatments have not helped. However, it is unclear whether IV MgSO4 is effective, particularly in less severe cases, and we wanted to answer this question.
<ABS> How did we answer the question?
<ABS> We looked for trials that compared IV MgSO4 versus placebo in adults attending the ED with an asthma exacerbation. The most recent searches were done on 2 May 2014. We were interested primarily in whether IV MgSO4 reduced the number of people needing to be admitted to hospital, and we looked at several other measures as well, including time spent in the ED, lung function and symptom scores.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 2313 people. These studies varied in terms of how bad exacerbations had to be for people to be included and in terms of what other treatments were provided before IV MgSO4was given, but almost all trials gave participants at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting medications and steroid tablets or injection.
<ABS> Overall, IV MgSO4 reduced the need for hospital admission compared with placebo (seven fewer per 100 treated; 95% confidence interval two to 13 fewer). Not enough information was available to show whether the reduction in hospital admissions was associated with severity of the asthma exacerbation, or whether it made a difference what other treatments were given. Evidence suggests that IV MgSO4 improved some lung function parameters, but for other measures such as heart rate, variation among study findings reduced our confidence in the results. We did not find a difference between IV MgSO4 and placebo in most other measures (including time spent in the ED, respiratory rate and blood pressure), and adverse events generally were poorly reported.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> This review showed that IV MgSO4 reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with exacerbations of asthma when other first-line medications have not relieved the acute symptoms (i.e. oxygen, inhaled short-acting medications and IV steroids). Evidence for other measures of benefit and safety was limited.
<ABS> Researchers should clearly define the severity of the asthma condition among people in their studies while carefully recording adverse events.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of May 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1.
<MaM> We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review.
<RES> Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years.
<RES> Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I2 = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I2 = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I2 = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions.
<RES> Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure).
<RES> Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Use of two contraceptive methods (dual-method use) refers to using condoms plus another modern method of contraception. The latter method is usually hormonal (like birth control pills) or a non-hormonal intrauterine system. Unprotected sex results in disease and death in many areas of the world due to HIV/STI. Millions of women, especially in lower-resource areas, also have an unmet need for preventing unplanned pregnancy. We examined studies of dual-method use, which can better prevent pregnancy and protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
<ABS> Through January 2014, we did computer searches for studies of programs to improve use of dual-methods. We wrote to researchers to find missing data. Studies examined a behavioral intervention for improving dual-method use. The educational program had to address preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI by using condoms plus another modern contraceptive. The intervention was compared with a different program, usual care, or no intervention.
<ABS> We only found four studies to include. Three were randomized trials and the fourth was a pilot study for one of the included trials. The programs differed from one another. They included computer-delivered sessions tailored for each person; phone counseling added to clinic counseling; and case management plus a peer-leadership program. In the latter study, more women in the intervention group reported regular use of dual methods, namely birth control pills plus condoms, than the control group. The pilot study reported a trend toward more regular dual-method use for the intervention group compared to the control group. The other two trials did not show any major difference between the study groups in reported use of dual methods or in test results for pregnancy or STIs.
<ABS> We found few programs to improve use of dual methods, and only one showed an effect. The reports gave enough information on how the interventions were conducted. The studies had adequate follow-up periods of 12 to 24 months. However, the overall quality of results was low, mainly due to study design and losing many women to follow up.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review summarises trials evaluating the effects of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) compared to other artemisinin-based combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization. After searching for relevant trials up to July 2013, we included 27 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children and conducted between 2002 and 2010.
<ABS> What is uncomplicated malaria and how might dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine work
<ABS> Uncomplicated malaria is the mild form of malaria which usually causes a fever, with or without headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can develop into severe malaria with kidney failure, breathing difficulties, fitting, unconsciousness, and eventually death.
<ABS> DHA-P is one of five artemisinin-based combination therapies the World Health Organization currently recommends to treat malaria. These combinations contain an artemisinin component (such as dihydroartemisinin) which works very quickly to clear the malaria parasite from the person's blood, and a longer acting drug (such as piperaquine) which clears the remaining parasites from the blood and may prevent new infections with malaria for several weeks.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> DHA-P versus artemether lumefantrine
<ABS> In studies of people living in Africa, both DHA-P and artemether-lumefantrine are very effective at treating malaria (high quality evidence). However, DHA-P cures slightly more patients than artemether-lumefantrine, and it also prevents further malaria infections for longer after treatment (high quality evidence). DHA-P and artemether-lumefantrine probably have similar side effects (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<ABS> In studies of people living in Asia, DHA-P is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating malaria (moderate quality evidence). Artesunate plus mefloquine probably causes more nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations than DHA-P (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Overall, in some people, DHA-P has been seen to cause short term changes in electrocardiographs tracing the conduction of the heart rhythm (low quality evidence), but these small changes on the electrocardiograph resolved within one week without serious consequences.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 27 trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children, and conducted between 2002 and 2010. Most trials excluded infants aged less than six months and pregnant women.
<RES> DHA-P versus artemether-lumefantrine
<RES> In Africa, over 28 days follow-up, DHA-P is superior to artemether-lumefantrine at preventing further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.39, nine trials, 6200 participants, high quality evidence), and although PCR-adjusted treatment failure was below 5% for both ACTs, it was consistently lower with DHA-P (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62, nine trials, 5417 participants, high quality evidence). DHA-P has a longer prophylactic effect on new infections which may last for up to 63 days (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78, two trials, 3200 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> In Asia and Oceania, no differences have been shown at day 28 (four trials, 1143 participants, moderate quality evidence), or day 63 (one trial, 323 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Compared to artemether-lumefantrine, no difference was seen in prolonged QTc (low quality evidence), and no cardiac arrhythmias were reported. The frequency of other adverse events is probably similar with both combinations (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<RES> In the only trial from South America, there were fewer recurrent parastaemias over 63 days with artesunate plus mefloquine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.40 to 27.35, one trial, 445 participants, low quality evidence), but no differences were seen once adjusted for new infections (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: one trial, 435 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P is associated with less nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations compared to artesunate plus mefloquine (moderate quality evidence). DHA-P was associated with more frequent prolongation of the QTc interval (low quality evidence), but no cardiac arrhythmias were reported.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Laparoscopic surgery for pain and subfertility associated with endometriosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Endometriosis is the presence in inappropriate sites of tissue that normally lines the uterus. It can cause pain and subfertility. Different treatments for endometriosis are available, one of which is laparoscopic ('key hole') surgery, performed to remove visible areas of endometriosis. Cochrane review authors assessed the evidence on the use of laparoscopic surgery to treat pain and fertility problems in women with endometriosis. Laparoscopic surgical techniques include ablation, which means destruction of a lesion (for example by burning), and excision, which means cutting a lesion out.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 10 randomised controlled trials (involving 973 participants). They were conducted in Australia, Canada, Egypt, Iran and the United Kingdom. Most compared laparoscopic ablation or excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only. Four of the 10 studies reported their source of funding. The evidence was current to July 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that laparoscopic surgery may be of benefit in treating overall pain and subfertility associated with mild to moderate endometriosis. Laparoscopic excision and ablation were similarly effective in relieving pain, although this result came from a single study. There was insufficient evidence on adverse events to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was moderate with regard to the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery. Additional studies are needed in this field, and these should report adverse events as an outcome.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The difference between laparoscopic ablation and laparoscopic excision in the proportion of women reporting overall pain relief at 12 months on a VAS 0 to 10 pain scale was 0 (95% CI -1.22 to 1.22, P = 1.00, 1 RCT, 103 participants, low quality evidence).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A concern, mainly raised by relatives, was that opioids were over-prescribed, used to hasten death, to reduce consciousness, and diminish the patient's desire or ability to accept food or drink. This review was commissioned to look at adverse events associated with the use of opioids to treat cancer pain. This clinical trial data set is the most relevant we have to people at the end of life, though people treated for cancer pain are not usually at the end of their lives. The studies are the closest we can get in the absence of clinical studies at the end of life in (mostly) older people.
<ABS> We included randomised trials from Cochrane reviews of four opioids used to treat cancer pain: morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine. This provided 77 studies with over 5,000 people randomised to various treatments. Trial quality was generally poor; particular problems included small study size, and not reporting adverse events in all patients, or all recorded adverse events. Known problems with adverse event measurement, recording, and reporting made assessment even more difficult. The population in the cancer pain trials were mainly aged between 50 and 70 years.
<ABS> For all four opioids together, 1 in 4 people experienced constipation and somnolence (sleepiness, drowsiness), 1 in 5 experienced nausea and dry mouth, and 1 in 8 experienced vomiting, anorexia, and dizziness. Weakness, diarrhoea, insomnia, mood change, hallucinations and dehydration occurred at rates of 1 in 20 people and below. Some of these may be good markers for the effects of opioids on consciousness, appetite, and thirst in end-of-life care in all patients deemed to be dying.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The impact of opioids was a particular concern because of their potential influence on consciousness, appetite and thirst in people near the end of life. There was concern that impaired patient consciousness may lead to an earlier death, and that effects of opioids on appetite and thirst may result in unnecessary suffering. This rapid review, commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research, used standard Cochrane methodology to examine adverse effects of morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine in cancer pain studies as a close approximation to possible effects in the dying patient.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Comparative measures of harm were known to be unlikely, and we therefore calculated the proportion of participants experiencing each of the adverse events of interest with each opioid, and for all four opioid drugs combined.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Direct measures of patient consciousness, patient appetite, or thirst were not apparent. For opioids used to treat cancer pain adverse event incidence rates were 25% for constipation, 23% for somnolence, 21% for nausea, 17% for dry mouth, and 13% for vomiting, anorexia, and dizziness. Asthenia, diarrhoea, insomnia, mood change, hallucinations and dehydration occurred at incidence rates of 5% and below.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no direct evidence that opioids affected patient consciousness, appetite or thirst when used to treat cancer pain. However, somnolence, dry mouth, and anorexia were common adverse events in people with cancer pain treated with morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, or codeine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Hepatitis C virus is mainly transmitted by contact to infected blood. Chronic hepatitis C infection affects around 3% of the world population and progresses slowly. Most patients present without symptoms, or with symptoms like fatigue or liver-related morbidity. Frequently, the disease is discovered by coincidence because of abnormal laboratory results. Around 5% to 40% of all infected patients will develop severe liver damage which can cause severe liver-related morbidities and eventually death. Current treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin and in some subgroups of patients these agents are combined with telaprevir or boceprevir, or other direct acting antivirals. In about 70% of patients with chronic hepatitis C, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the blood, but the clinical effects are not known. Aminoadamantanes (another group of antiviral drugs), mostly amantadine, have been tested in several clinical trials. The authors have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of amantadine.
<ABS> Review questions and study characteristics
<ABS> Only amantadine has been tested in randomised clinical trials including participants with chronic hepatitis C. The main goal of these trials was to investigate whether amantadine as a single therapy or amantadine in combination with other antiviral therapies, compared with placebo or no intervention (with or without antiviral therapy), could increase the proportion of patients with virus eradication from the blood. This review evaluates whether amantadine versus other antiviral drugs has any beneficial or harmful effect in patients with chronic hepatitis C. The trials compared amantadine with ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma. The primary outcomes were the composite of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events. This review includes six randomised clinical trials with a total of 581 patients.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> All the included trials were with high risk of bias. This review did not demonstrate any benefits or harms of amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events, but data were sparse. Compared with ribavirin, amantadine seemed to lead to more participants who fail to achieve sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment). This may be real or due to bias (systematic errors), but it does not seem to be due to play of chance (random errors), as trial sequential analysis confirmed the result. Compared with mycophenolate mofetil, amantadine seemed less effective in achieving end-of-treatment virological response. Compared with interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma, amantadine did not seem to offer benefits. Accordingly, the evidence from this review does not support the routine clinical use of amantadine. Therefore, it is probably better to examine the effects of other direct acting antivirals in the hepatitis C field than to conduct more randomised clinical trials on amantadine. We found no randomised clinical trials assessing other aminoadamantanes, for example rimantadine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) given with corticosteroids does not improve the benefit of corticosteroids on the lungs of babies born too early, and may increase harm.
<ABS> Babies born preterm (before 37 weeks of pregnancy) are at risk of breathing difficulties (such as respiratory distress syndrome).
<ABS> TRH increases thyroid hormones in the baby and it has been thought that adding TRH to corticosteroids for women giving birth early may increase the benefit of corticosteroids on the baby's lungs.
<ABS> This review included 15 trials, of a moderate risk of bias, that involved over 4600 women and their babies.
<ABS> In this review, TRH, given with corticosteroids to women at risk of early birth, was not shown to further reduce the breathing difficulties for the babies.
<ABS> Babies born to mothers who had received TRH with corticosteroids, were more likely to require support for breathing than babies born to mothers who received only corticosteroids.
<ABS> Women receiving TRH were more likely to experience adverse side effects, such as nausea, vomiting and flushing than women who only received corticosteroids.
<ABS> Therefore, based on the current available evidence, TRH is not recommended to be given to women at risk of preterm birth for preventing neonatal respiratory disease.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also contacted trial authors.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials in women at sufficient risk of preterm birth to warrant the use of prenatal corticosteroids to promote lung maturity.
<MaM> TRH and corticosteroids were compared with corticosteroids, with or without placebo.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Over 4600 women were recruited into the 15 trials included in the review, however two trials did not contribute any outcome data to the review.
<RES> The trials had a moderate risk of bias.
<RES> Overall, prenatal TRH, in addition to corticosteroids, did not reduce the risk of death prior to hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.27, six trials, 3694 infants), neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22, nine trials, 3833 infants), or chronic lung disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.19, five trials, 2511 infants), and did not improve any of the secondary fetal, neonatal or childhood outcomes assessed by intention-to-treat analyses.
<RES> Indeed, the data showed prenatal TRH to have adverse effects for women and their infants.
<RES> All side effects reported (nausea, vomiting, light headedness, urgency of micturition, facial flushing) were significantly more likely to occur in women receiving TRH.
<RES> In the infants, prenatal TRH increased the risk of needing respiratory support (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.29, three trials, 1969 infants), and of having a low Apgar score at five minutes (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.92, three trials, 1969 infants).
<RES> Only three trials provided data on childhood follow-up, and while one trial suggested poorer outcomes for infants who were exposed to prenatal TRH, the other two trials, that assessed infants using an established developmental instrument, showed no clear differences between groups in follow-up outcomes.
<RES> Sensitivity analyses by trial quality, or subgroups with differing times from entry to birth, or different dose regimens of TRH, did not change these findings.

<H1> Local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About 20% of strokes result from narrowing of the carotid artery, which is the main artery supplying blood to the brain.
<ABS> Blood clots can form at the point of narrowing.
<ABS> If a blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream, it can be carried into the brain, block the blood supply there and cause a stroke.
<ABS> However, even with very careful surgery, approximately one in 20 patients will suffer a stroke caused by the operation itself.
<ABS> The use of local anaesthesia rather than general anaesthesia might lower the risk of a stroke happening during or after surgery.
<ABS> This review includes 14 randomised trials, involving 4596 operations, comparing the use of local anaesthetic to general anaesthetic for carotid endarterectomy.
<ABS> There was no statistically significant difference between the anaesthetic techniques in the percentage of patients who had a stroke or died within 30 days of surgery.
<ABS> This systematic review provides evidence to suggest that patients and surgeons can choose either anaesthetic technique, depending on the clinical situation and their own preferences.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Carotid endarterectomy may significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with recently symptomatic, severe carotid artery stenosis.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1996, and previously updated in 2004 and 2008.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also handsearched relevant journals, and searched the reference lists of articles identified.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 14 randomised trials involving 4596 operations, of which 3526 were from the single largest trial (GALA).
<RES> In general, reporting of methodology in the included studies was poor.
<RES> All studies were unable to blind patients and surgical teams to randomised treatment allocation and for most studies the blinding of outcome assessors was unclear.
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of stroke within 30 days of surgery between the local anaesthesia group and the general anaesthesia group.
<RES> The incidence of strokes in the local anaesthesia group was 3.2% compared to 3.5% in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.28).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who had a stroke or died within 30 days of surgery.
<RES> In the local anaesthesia group 3.6% of patients had a stroke or died compared to 4.2% of patients in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16).
<RES> There was a non-significant trend towards lower operative mortality with local anaesthetic.
<RES> In the local anaesthesia group 0.9% of patients died within 30 days of surgery compared to 1.5% of patients in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07).
<RES> However, neither the GALA trial or the pooled analysis were adequately powered to reliably detect an effect on mortality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The proportion of patients who had a stroke or died within 30 days of surgery did not differ significantly between the two types of anaesthetic techniques used during carotid endarterectomy.
<CON> This systematic review provides evidence to suggest that patients and surgeons can choose either anaesthetic technique, depending on the clinical situation and their own preferences.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question
<ABS> We wanted to compare the effect of routine shunting versus selective or no shunting during carotid endarterectomy, and to assess the effect of different methods for selection of people for shunting.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 20% of strokes result from narrowing of the carotid artery (the main artery supplying blood to the brain).
<ABS> Carotid endarterectomy is an operation to remove this narrowing and therefore reduce the risk of stroke.
<ABS> However, there is a 5% to 10% risk of the operation itself causing a stroke.
<ABS> The use of a silicon tube, or shunt, as a temporary bypass can reduce the length of time that blood flow to the brain is interrupted during the operation.
<ABS> This may reduce the risk of perioperative stroke but could also result in arterial wall damage and therefore increase the risk of stroke.
<ABS> Shunt surgery falls into three categories.
<ABS> Firstly, in routine shunting, the surgeon inserts a shunt in every patient.
<ABS> Secondly, in selective shunting, the surgeon only uses a shunt in patients with an inadequate blood supply to the brain following clamping; various cerebral monitoring techniques, such as ultrasound for predicting who needs a shunt, have been used in this policy.
<ABS> Thirdly, in no shunting, surgeons do not employ shunts at all.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified six studies up to August 2013, for inclusion in the review.
<ABS> These studies included a total of 1270 participants.
<ABS> Three of the trials compared routine shunting with no shunting, one trial compared routine shunting versus selective shunting, and another two trials compared different methods of monitoring in selective shunting.
<ABS> We have not yet identified any trials that compared selective shunting with no shunting.
<ABS> All the included trials assessed the use of shunting in people undergoing endarterectomy under general anaesthetic.
<ABS> The age of the participants ranged from 40 to 89 years, and overall, there were more male than female participants.
<ABS> Where reported, participants were followed up for no longer than 30 days.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is still no evidence for the use of a carotid shunt during carotid endarterectomy.
<ABS> This review suggests a benefit from the use of a shunt, but the overall results were not statistically significant.
<ABS> More trials are needed.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> There were significant problems with the quality of the randomised trials and, overall, the reporting of study methodology was poor.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This may improve outcome.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review originally published in 1996 and previously updated in 2009.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We handsearched journals and conference proceedings, checked reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently performed the searches and applied the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> For this update, we identified two new relevant randomised controlled trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included six trials involving 1270 participants in the review: three trials involving 686 participants compared routine shunting with no shunting, one trial involving 200 participants compared routine shunting with selective shunting, one trial involving 253 participants compared selective shunting with and without near-infrared refractory spectroscopy monitoring, and the other trial involving 131 participants compared shunting with a combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure measurement with shunting by carotid pressure measurement alone.
<RES> In general, reporting of methodology in the included studies was poor.
<RES> For most studies, the blinding of outcome assessors and the report of prespecified outcomes were unclear.
<RES> For routine versus no shunting, there was no significant difference in the rate of all stroke, ipsilateral stroke or death up to 30 days after surgery, although data were limited.
<RES> No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of postoperative neurological deficit between selective shunting with and without near-infrared refractory spectroscopy monitoring, However, this analysis was inadequately powered to reliably detect the effect.
<RES> There was no significant difference between the risk of ipsilateral stroke in participants selected for shunting with the combination of electroencephalographic and carotid pressure assessment compared with pressure assessment alone, although again the data were limited.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review concluded that the data available were too limited to either support or refute the use of routine or selective shunting in carotid endarterectomy.
<CON> Large scale randomised trials of routine shunting versus selective shunting are required.
<CON> No method of monitoring in selective shunting has been shown to produce better outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have low oxygen levels in their blood when they are resting or when moving.
<ABS> Low oxygen levels are known as hypoxaemia.
<ABS> These patients can carry around an oxygen supply (oxygen in small cylinders, portable liquid oxygen systems or battery-powered oxygen concentrators) so that they have oxygen to breathe to make simple tasks such as getting dressed, leaving the house, doing chores or even walking around their own home easier, and to help them to breathe.
<ABS> This portable oxygen device is referred to as 'ambulatory oxygen.'
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We conducted this review to find out the long-term benefit of ambulatory oxygen therapy for people who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We looked at randomised controlled trials that compared ambulatory oxygen versus a placebo (normal air).
<ABS> We found four studies on 331 people with a mean age of 71 years.
<ABS> Two of the included studies were from Australia, one from New Zealand and one from Canada.
<ABS> The method of oxygen delivery and the dose of oxygen varied, although equipment in all instances consisted of light-weight or portable cylinders with flow ranging from 3 L/min to 6 L/min.
<ABS> Final follow-up was reported as 12 weeks for three studies and two weeks for the Nonoyama study.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that ambulatory oxygen therapy reduced breathlessness and decreased the number of patients who felt tired.
<ABS> However, the distance that people could walk in five to six minutes and survival (death rate) did not change.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence from the studies in this review was poor.
<ABS> The way the studies were conducted (methods) was not fully reported.
<ABS> Most studies were lacking the prepublished study plan (protocol).
<ABS> Bottom line
<ABS> From this review, it is not possible to know whether ambulatory oxygen therapy should be provided during exercise or for day-to-day activities for patients with COPD who are not severely hypoxaemic at rest.
<ABS> This Cochrane plain language summary is up-to-date as of November 2012.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Ambulatory oxygen therapy refers to provision of oxygen therapy during exercise and activities of daily living.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL, was searched.
<MaM> Online clinical trial registers, including Controlled Clinical Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), government registries (clinicaltrials.gov) and World Health Organization (WHO) registries (www.who.int/trialsearch), were screened for ongoing and recently completed studies.
<MaM> Bibliographies of included studies were searched for additional trials that may meet the inclusion criteria and were not retrieved by the above search strategy.
<MaM> Authors of identified trials were contacted to provide other published and unpublished studies.
<MaM> Searches were current as of November 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methods as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No other statistically significant benefits were observed for exercise capacity among the other trials or individual N-of-1 studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In patients with COPD with moderate hypoxia, current evidence on ambulatory oxygen therapy reveals improvements in dyspnoea post exercise and in the dyspnoea and fatigue domain of quality of life.
<CON> However, evidence for the clinical utility and effectiveness of ambulatory oxygen in improving mortality and exercise capacity was not evident in this review.
<CON> Methodologically rigorous RCTs with sufficient power to detect a difference are required to investigate the role of ambulatory oxygen in the management of COPD.

<H1> Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Sinusitis is one of the most common reasons for visiting a doctor and an estimated 20 million cases of acute sinusitis occur every year in the USA alone.
<ABS> There are four pairs of sinuses linked to the bony structures around the nose: maxillary, frontal, ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses.
<ABS> In sinusitis, these membrane-lined air spaces become infected, which causes pain and discharge from the nose.
<ABS> Treatment options include decongestants, steroid drops or sprays, mucus-clearing drugs (mucolytics), antihistamines and antibiotics and sometimes sinus puncture and irrigation for removal of purulent secretions.
<ABS> In most cases sinusitis occurs during viral infections where antibiotics are ineffective, but the few cases that also have a bacterial infection (one or two out of every 100 patients with sinus symptoms) could benefit.
<ABS> It is important to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics and limit the potential for antibiotic resistance.
<ABS> This updated review compiled data from 63 separate studies that used a variety of antibiotics for simple maxillary sinus infection, i.e. non-complicated acute sinusitis in a person with a healthy immune system.
<ABS> Nine of the studies compared antibiotics to placebo (1915 participants; seven of the studies conducted in primary care), and 54 studies compared different classes of antibiotics.
<ABS> Five of the nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1058 participants found that most participants got better within two weeks, regardless of whether they received the antibiotic or not (roughly 9 out of 10 participants in antibiotic groups and 8 out of 10 in placebo groups).
<ABS> Although all the five studies in this main outcome were assessed as having low risk of bias, the overall evidence was assessed only as being of moderate quality (it is possible that a new large study can change the estimate).
<ABS> In the remaining 54 studies comparing different antibiotics (10 different comparisons), no antibiotic was found to be superior to another.
<ABS> The evidence is current to March 2013.
<ABS> The small benefit gained by antibiotics may be overridden by the negative effects of the drugs.
<ABS> In addition to patient-related adverse effects (like skin rash and gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting), side effects include the risk of increased resistance to antibiotics amongst community-acquired pathogens (bacteria).
<ABS> This review found that antibiotics will help some people a bit, but do not make a major difference to most people with acute maxillary sinusitis being treated in primary care.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies.
<MaM> We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).
<MaM> We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults.
<MaM> We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not.
<MaM> All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model.
<MaM> In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes.
<MaM> Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up.
<MaM> We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons).
<RES> Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days.
<RES> In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> However, the clinical benefit was small.
<RES> Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies.
<RES> When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up.
<RES> Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%).
<RES> However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups.
<RES> In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another.
<RES> However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis.
<CON> However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks.
<CON> Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics for acute bronchitis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotic treatment for people with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis for an acute cough, which may or may not be productive of mucus or sputum.
<ABS> It occurs when the tubes (bronchi) within the lungs become inflamed and may be caused by viruses or bacteria.
<ABS> Symptoms generally last for two weeks but the associated cough can last for up to eight weeks.
<ABS> Recently, there has been controversy over the term acute bronchitis as it covers a range of clinical presentations that may overlap with other diagnoses such as upper or lower respiratory tract infections.
<ABS> For this reason, some have suggested using the term 'acute lower respiratory tract infection when pneumonia is not suspected' as this is more specific.
<ABS> Antibiotics are commonly prescribed to treat this condition though other treatments providing symptom relief are commonly used.
<ABS> Antibiotics can have adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea but can cause more serious reactions related to anaphylaxis in those allergic to them.
<ABS> In healthy communities, there is little evidence of bacterial infection in people with bronchitis and there is no practical test to distinguish between bacterial and viral bronchitis.
<ABS> Within this context the use of antibiotics to treat acute bronchitis is controversial but common.
<ABS> Concerns that prescribing unnecessary antibiotics increases antibiotic resistance exists.
<ABS> We included 17 trials with 3936 participants diagnosed with acute bronchitis and randomly assigned to receive any antibiotic treatment or a placebo or no treatment.
<ABS> Co-treatments with other medications to relieve symptoms were allowed if they were given to all patients.
<ABS> We excluded patients with pre-existing underlying pulmonary disease such as chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
<ABS> The quality of trials was generally good, particularly for more recent studies.
<ABS> There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis and a large study involving 1038 patients from 12 countries included in this update has confirmed this finding.
<ABS> Some people treated with antibiotics recovered a bit more quickly with reductions in cough-related outcomes though the difference was of doubtful clinical significance as it amounted to a difference of half a day over an 8 to 10 day period.
<ABS> There was a statistically significant but small increase in adverse side effects in patients treated with antibiotics.
<ABS> The use of antibiotics needs to be considered in the context of the potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition and costs of antibiotic use, particularly the potential harms at population level associated with increasing antibiotic resistance.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen trials with 3936 participants were included in the primary analysis.
<RES> The quality of trials was generally good.
<RES> There was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.
<RES> At follow-up, there was no difference in participants described as being clinically improved between antibiotic and placebo groups (11 studies with 3841 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.15; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 22.
<RES> Participants given antibiotics were less likely to have a cough (four studies with 275 participants, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85; NNTB 6); have a night cough (four studies with 538 participants, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; NNTB 7) and a shorter mean cough duration (seven studies with 2776 participants, mean difference (MD) -0.46 days, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.04).
<RES> The differences in presence of a productive cough at follow-up and MD of productive cough did not reach statistical significance.
<RES> Antibiotic-treated patients were more likely to be unimproved according to clinician's global assessment (six studies with 891 participants, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.79; NNTB 25); have an abnormal lung exam (five studies with 613 participants, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.70; NNTB 6); have a reduction in days feeling ill (five studies with 809 participants, MD -0.64 days, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.13) and a reduction in days with limited activity (six studies with 767 participants MD -0.49 days, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.04).
<RES> The differences in proportions with activity limitations at follow-up did not reach statistical significance.
<RES> There was a significant trend towards an increase in adverse effects in the antibiotic group (12 studies with 3496 participants) (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36; NNT for an additional adverse effect 5).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is limited evidence to support the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis.
<CON> Antibiotics may have a modest beneficial effect in some patients such as frail, elderly people with multimorbidity who may not have been included in trials to date.
<CON> However, the magnitude of this benefit needs to be considered in the broader context of potential side effects, medicalisation for a self-limiting condition, increased resistance to respiratory pathogens and cost of antibiotic treatment.


<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Cette revue inclut à présent un total de 14 études randomisant 7837 femmes.
<RES> Maternal infection was reduced with the use of any prophylactic antibiotics compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86; NNTB 34, 95% CI 24 to 63) and any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92; NNTB 47, 95% CI 31 to 119).
<RES> However, caution should be exercised with this finding due to the possibility of bias shown by funnel plot asymmetry.
<RES> Any beta-lactam compared with no beta-lactam antibiotics was associated with an increase in maternal adverse drug reaction (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.54; NNTH 17, 95% CI 526 to 7).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review did not demonstrate any benefit in important neonatal outcomes with the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, although maternal infection may be reduced.
<CON> Of concern, is the finding of short- and longer-term harm for children of mothers exposed to antibiotics.
<CON> The evidence supports not giving antibiotics routinely to women in preterm labour with intact membranes in the absence of overt signs of infection.
<CON> Further research is required to develop sensitive markers of subclinical infection for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, as this is a group that might benefit from future novel interventions, including new modalities of antibiotic therapy.
<CON> The results of this review demonstrate the need for future trials in the area of preterm birth to include assessment of long-term neurodevelopmental outcome.

<H1> Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chlorpromazine versus placebo for schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> For previous plain language summary please see Appendix 3.
<ABS> People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions).
<ABS> The main treatment for these symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> Chlorpromazine was one of the first drugs discovered to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia during the 1950s.
<ABS> It remains one of the most commonly used and inexpensive treatments even today.
<ABS> However, being an older drug (‘typical’ or first generation) it also has serious side effects, such as blurred vision, a dry mouth, tremors or uncontrollable shaking, depression, muscle stiffness and restlessness.
<ABS> An update search was carried out in 2012 and the review now includes 55 studies that assess the effects of chlorpromazine in treating schizophrenia compared with no active treatment (‘dummy’ treatment or placebo).
<ABS> Evidence was, in the main, rated by the review authors as low quality.
<ABS> There is some evidence to suggest that chlorpromazine reduces relapse and improves people’s mental health, symptoms and functioning.
<ABS> However, the side effects of chlorpromazine are severe and debilitating.
<ABS> Chlorpromazine causes sleepiness and sedation.
<ABS> It also causes movement disorders (such as tremors and uncontrollable shaking), considerable weight gain and lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness.
<ABS> Chlorpromazine is low-cost and widely available.
<ABS> Despite its many side effects, chlorpromazine is likely to remain a benchmark drug and one of the most widely used treatments for schizophrenia worldwide.
<ABS> It should be noted that the quality of evidence from the 55 included studies was low and in addition to this, 315 studies were excluded because of flaws in the reporting of information or data and in research design and methods.
<ABS> Larger, better conducted and reported trials should focus on important outcomes such as quality of life, levels of satisfaction, relapse, hospital discharge or admission and number of violent incidents.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To review the effects of chlorpromazine compared with placebo, for the treatment of schizophrenia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (15 May 2012).
<MaM> We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials for additional information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Primary outcomes of interest were death, violent behaviours, overall improvement, relapse and satisfaction with care.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, re-inspected and quality assessed these.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and estimated the 95% confidence interval (CI) around this.
<MaM> We excluded continuous data if more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up.
<MaM> Where continuous data were included, we analysed this data using mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval.
<MaM> We used a fixed-effect model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We inspected over 1100 electronic records.
<RES> The review currently includes 315 excluded studies and 55 included studies.
<RES> The quality of the evidence is very low.
<RES> We found chlorpromazine reduced the number of participants experiencing a relapse compared with placebo during six months to two years follow-up (n = 512, 3 RCTs, RR 0.65 CI 0.47 to 0.90), but data were heterogeneous.
<RES> No difference was found in relapse rates in the short, medium or long term over two years, although data were also heterogeneous.
<RES> We found chlorpromazine provided a global improvement in a person's symptoms and functioning (n = 1164, 14 RCTs, RR 0.71 CI 0.58 to 0.86).
<RES> Fewer people allocated to chlorpromazine left trials early ( n = 1831, 27 RCTs, RR 0.64 CI 0.53 to 0.78) compared with placebo.
<RES> There are many adverse effects.
<RES> Chlorpromazine is clearly sedating (n = 1627, 23 RCTs, RR 2.79 CI 2.25 to 3.45), it increases a person's chances of experiencing acute movement disorders (n = 942, 5 RCTs, RR 3.47 CI 1.50 to 8.03) and parkinsonism (n = 1468, 15 RCTs, RR 2.11 CI 1.59 to 2.80).
<RES> Akathisia did not occur more often in the chlorpromazine group than placebo.
<RES> Chlorpromazine clearly causes a lowering of blood pressure with accompanying dizziness (n = 1488, 18 RCTs, RR 2.38 CI 1.74 to 3.25) and considerable weight gain (n = 165, 5 RCTs, RR 4.92 CI 2.32 to 10.43).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The results of this review confirm much that clinicians and recipients of care already know but aim to provide quantification to support clinical impression.
<CON> Chlorpromazine's global position as a 'benchmark' treatment for psychoses is not threatened by the findings of this review.
<CON> Chlorpromazine, in common use for half a century, is a well-established but imperfect treatment.
<CON> Judicious use of this best available evidence should lead to improved evidence-based decision making by clinicians, carers and patients.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Endometrial resection and ablation versus hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This Cochrane review concerns women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which is menstrual blood loss that a woman feels to be excessive and that often interferes with her quality of life.
<ABS> Researchers from The Cochrane Collaboration compared endometrial resection or ablation versus hysterectomy for women with HMB.
<ABS> The main factors (thought to be of greatest importance) were how well each operation was able to treat the symptoms of HMB, how women felt about undergoing each operation and what the complication rates were.
<ABS> Additional factors studied were how long each operation took to perform, how long women took to recover from the operation and how much the operation cost the hospital and the woman herself.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgical treatments for HMB include removal or destruction of the inside lining (endometrium) of the womb (endometrial resection or ablation) and surgical removal of the whole womb (hysterectomy).
<ABS> Both methods are commonly offered by gynaecologists, usually but not always after a non-surgical treatment has failed to correct the problem.
<ABS> Endometrial resection/ablation is performed via the entrance to the womb, without the need for a surgical cut.
<ABS> During a hysterectomy, the uterus can be removed via a surgical cut to the abdomen, via the vagina, or via 'keyhole' surgery that involves very small surgical cuts to the abdomen (laparoscopy); this last approach is a newer way to perform hysterectomy.
<ABS> Hysterectomy is effective in permanently stopping HMB, but it stops fertility and is associated with all the risks of major surgery, including infection and blood loss.
<ABS> These risks are smaller with endometrial resection/ablation.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> A systematic review of the research comparing endometrial resection and ablation versus hysterectomy for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding was most recently updated in October 2013 by researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, review authors included eight studies involving a total of 1,260 women.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are included in Cochrane reviews.
<ABS> RCTs are studies in which participants are randomly allocated to one of two groups, each receiving a different intervention (in this case, endometrial ablation/resection or hysterectomy).
<ABS> The two groups are then compared.
<ABS> RCTs that compared these two interventions were included in this review if they studied women with HMB who had not gone through menopause and who did not have cancer or precancer of the uterus.
<ABS> Key results and conclusions
<ABS> The review of studies revealed that endometrial ablation/resection is an effective and possibly cheaper alternative to hysterectomy with faster recovery, although retreatment with additional surgery is sometimes needed.
<ABS> Hysterectomy is associated with more definitive resolution of symptoms but longer operating times and greater potential for surgical complications.
<ABS> For both operations, women generally reported that undergoing the procedure was acceptable and that they were satisfied with their experience.
<ABS> Since laparoscopic hysterectomy has become more widely used, several of the previously described disadvantages of traditional types of hysterectomy have improved, and some outcomes such as duration of hospital stay, time to return to work and time to return to normal activities have become more comparable with those of endometrial ablation.
<ABS> However, laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with longer operating time than other modes of hysterectomy and requires more sophisticated surgical expertise and equipment.
<ABS> Only three of the eight trials included laparoscopic hysterectomy in their comparison.
<ABS> More trials in this area will be needed as this route of hysterectomy becomes more widely available.
<ABS> Identifying harms
<ABS> Both surgical treatments are considered to be generally safe, and low complication rates are reported.
<ABS> However, hysterectomy is associated with higher rates of infection and requirement for blood transfusion.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence reported in this review was occasionally of low quality, suggesting that further research is likely to change the result.
<ABS> This was the case for outcomes such as a woman’s perception of bleeding and proportion of women requiring further surgery for HMB.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), which includes both menorrhagia and metrorrhagia, is an important cause of ill health in women.
<INT> Surgical treatment of HMB often follows failed or ineffective medical therapy.
<INT> The definitive treatment is hysterectomy, but this is a major surgical procedure with significant physical and emotional complications, as well as social and economic costs.
<INT> Several less invasive surgical techniques (e.g. transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE), laser approaches) and various methods of endometrial ablation have been developed with the purpose of improving menstrual symptoms by removing or ablating the entire thickness of the endometrium.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Electronic searches for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) targeted but were not limited to the following: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Register of Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane CENTRAL register of trials.
<MaM> Searches were performed in 2007, 2008 and 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> Risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes were estimated from the data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight RCTs that fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this review were identified.
<RES> For two trials, the review authors identified multiple publications that assessed different outcomes at different postoperative time points for the same women.
<RES> An advantage in favour of hysterectomy compared with endometrial ablation was observed in various measures of improvement in bleeding symptoms and satisfaction rates.
<RES> A slightly lower proportion of women who underwent endometrial ablation perceived improvement in bleeding symptoms at one year (RR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.93, four studies, 650 women, I2 = 31%), at two years (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99, two studies, 292 women, I2 = 53%) and at four years (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99, two studies, 237 women, I2 = 79%).
<RES> The same group of women also showed improvement in pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score at one year (MD 24.40, 95% CI 16.01 to 32.79, one study, 68 women) and at two years (MD 44.00, 95% CI 36.09 to 51.91, one study, 68 women).
<RES> Repeat surgery resulting from failure of the initial treatment was more likely to be needed after endometrial ablation than after hysterectomy at one year (RR 14.9, 95% CI 5.2 to 42.6, six studies, 887 women, I2 = 0%), at two years (RR 23.4, 95% CI 8.3 to 65.8, six studies, 930 women, I2 = 0%), at three years (RR 11.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 80.1, one study, 172 women) and at four years (RR 36.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 259.2, one study, 197 women).
<RES> Most adverse events, both major and minor, were significantly more likely after hysterectomy during hospital stay.
<RES> Women who had a hysterectomy were more likely to experience sepsis (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.3, four studies, 621 women, I2 = 62%), blood transfusion (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.6, four studies, 751 women, I2 = 0%), pyrexia (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.4, three studies, 605 women, I2 = 66%), vault haematoma (RR 0.1, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.3, five studies, 858 women, I2 = 0%) and wound haematoma (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.5, one study, 202 women) before hospital discharge.
<RES> After discharge from hospital, the only difference that was reported for this group was a higher rate of infection (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.5, one study, 172 women).
<RES> For some outcomes (such as a woman’s perception of bleeding and proportion of women requiring further surgery for HMB), a low GRADE score was generated, suggesting that further research in these areas is likely to change the estimates.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Endometrial resection and ablation offers an alternative to hysterectomy as a surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding.
<CON> Both procedures are effective, and satisfaction rates are high.
<CON> The initial cost of endometrial destruction is significantly lower than that of hysterectomy, but, because retreatment is often necessary, the cost difference narrows over time.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have intakes of magnesium below recommended levels.
<ABS> Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce growth restriction of the fetus and pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine during pregnancy), and increase birthweight.
<ABS> This review aimed to assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal and paediatric outcomes.
<ABS> We included 10 randomised trials involving 9090 women and their babies in this review.
<ABS> These trials were of a low to moderate quality overall.
<ABS> No difference in the risk of perinatal mortality (stillbirth and death of babies prior to hospital discharge) was found when we compared the group of babies born to mothers who received magnesium during their pregnancy and the group of babies born to mothers who did not receive magnesium.
<ABS> Magnesium supplementation did not reduce the risk of babies being born small for their gestational age, and did not reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia for the mothers.
<ABS> We found no convincing evidence that magnesium supplementation during pregnancy is beneficial.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium.
<INT> Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may be able to reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia, and increase birthweight.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included.
<MaM> The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality and pre-eclampsia.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre).
<RES> All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials a placebo was used, and in two trials no treatment was given to the control group.
<RES> In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement, and doses administered varied, including: magnesium oxide, 1000 mg daily from ≤ four months post-conception (one trial); magnesium citrate, 365 mg daily from ≤ 18 weeks until hospitalisation after 38 weeks (one trial), and 340 mg daily from nine to 27 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium gluconate, 2 to 3 g from 28 weeks' gestation until birth (one trial), and 4 g daily from 23 weeks' gestation (one trial); magnesium aspartate, 15 mmol daily (three trials, commencing from either six to 21 weeks' gestation until birth, ≤ 16 weeks' gestation until birth, or < 12 weeks until birth), or 365 mg daily from 13 to 24 weeks until birth (one trial); and magnesium stearate, 128 mg elemental magnesium from 10 to 35 weeks until birth (one trial).
<RES> In the analysis of all trials, oral magnesium supplementation compared to no magnesium was associated with no significant difference in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal death prior to discharge) (risk ratio (RR) 1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.67; five trials, 5903 infants), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; three trials, 1291 infants), or pre-eclampsia (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.32; three trials, 1042 women).
<RES> None of the included trials reported on maternal mortality.
<RES> Considering secondary outcomes, while no increased risk of stillbirth was observed, a possible increased risk of neonatal death prior to hospital discharge was shown for infants born to mothers who had received magnesium (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.02 to 4.75; four trials, 5373 infants).
<RES> One trial contributed over 70% of the participants to the analysis for this outcome; the trial authors suggested that the large number of severe congenital anomalies in the supplemented group (unlikely attributable to magnesium) and the deaths of two sets of twins (with birthweights < 750 g) in the supplemented group likely accounted for the increased risk of death observed, and thus this result should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> Furthermore, when the deaths due to severe congenital abnormalities in this trial were excluded from the meta-analysis, no increased risk of neonatal death was seen for the magnesium supplemented group.
<RES> Magnesium supplementation was associated with significantly fewer babies with an Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; four trials, 1083 infants), with meconium-stained liquor (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; one trial, 4082 infants), late fetal heart decelerations (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88; one trial, 4082 infants), and mild hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98; one trial, 4082 infants).
<RES> Women receiving magnesium were significantly less likely to require hospitalisation during pregnancy (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; three trials, 1158 women).
<RES> Of the 10 trials included in the review, only two were judged to be of high quality overall.
<RES> When an analysis was restricted to these two trials none of the review's primary outcomes (perinatal mortality, small-for-gestational age, pre-eclampsia) were significantly different between the magnesium supplemented and control groups.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of the mother having complications during pregnancy and the baby being born with low birthweight and preterm (before 37 weeks).
<ABS> Tobacco smoking during pregnancy is relatively common, although the trend is towards it becoming less frequent in high-income countries and more frequent in low- to middle-income countries.
<ABS> The review showed that psychosocial interventions to support women to stop smoking increased the proportion of women who stopped smoking in late pregnancy and reduced the number of low birthweight and preterm births.
<ABS> There did not appear to be any adverse effects from the psychosocial interventions, and three studies measured an improvement in women's psychological wellbeing.
<ABS> The review includes 86 randomised controlled trials, with data from seventy-seven trials (involving over 29,000 women).
<ABS> Nearly all studies were in high-income countries.
<ABS> The intervention that supported the most women to stop smoking in pregnancy appeared to be providing incentives.
<ABS> However, these results are based on only four trials with a small number of women (all in the US), and they only seemed to help women stop smoking when provided intensively (three trials).
<ABS> Counselling also appeared to be effective in supporting women to quit, but only when combined with other strategies (27 trials).
<ABS> The effectiveness of counselling was less clear when women in the control group received a less intensive smoking intervention (16 trials).
<ABS> Feedback also appeared to help women quit, but only when compared with usual care and combined with other strategies (two studies).
<ABS> It was unclear whether health education alone helped women quit, but the numbers of women involved in these trials were comparatively small.
<ABS> The evidence for social support was mixed; for instance, targeted peer support appeared to help women quit (five trials) but in one trial partner support did not.
<ABS> Women also reported that peer and partner support could be both helpful and unhelpful.
<ABS> Increasing the frequency and duration of the intervention did not appear to increase the effectiveness.
<ABS> Interventions appeared to be as effective for women who were poor, as those who were not; but there is insufficient evidence that the interventions were effective for ethnic (five trials) and aboriginal women (two trials).
<ABS> Trials where the interventions became part of routine pregnancy care did not appear to help more women to quit, which suggests there are challenges to translating this evidence into practice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Smoking in pregnancy is decreasing in high-income countries, but is strongly associated with poverty and increasing in low- to middle-income countries.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> Direct comparisons were conducted in RevMan, and subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis were conducted in SPSS.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eighty-six trials were included in this updated review, with 77 trials (involving over 29,000 women) providing data on smoking abstinence in late pregnancy.
<RES> In separate comparisons, counselling interventions demonstrated a significant effect compared with usual care (27 studies; average risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.75), and a borderline effect compared with less intensive interventions (16 studies; average RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.82).
<RES> However, a significant effect was only seen in subsets where counselling was provided in conjunction with other strategies.
<RES> It was unclear whether any type of counselling strategy is more effective than others (one study; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.53).
<RES> In studies comparing counselling and usual care (the largest comparison), it was unclear whether interventions prevented smoking relapse among women who had stopped smoking spontaneously in early pregnancy (eight studies; average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21).
<RES> However, a clear effect was seen in smoking abstinence at zero to five months postpartum (10 studies; average RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.95), a borderline effect at six to 11 months (six studies; average RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77), and a significant effect at 12 to 17 months (two studies, average RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.23 to 3.96), but not in the longer term.
<RES> In other comparisons, the effect was not significantly different from the null effect for most secondary outcomes, but sample sizes were small.
<RES> Incentive-based interventions had the largest effect size compared with a less intensive intervention (one study; RR 3.64, 95% CI 1.84 to 7.23) and an alternative intervention (one study; RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.48 to 11.11).
<RES> Feedback interventions demonstrated a significant effect only when compared with usual care and provided in conjunction with other strategies, such as counselling (two studies; average RR 4.39, 95% CI 1.89 to 10.21), but the effect was unclear when compared with a less intensive intervention (two studies; average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.12).
<RES> The effect of health education was unclear when compared with usual care (three studies; average RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.59) or less intensive interventions (two studies; average RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.31).
<RES> Social support interventions appeared effective when provided by peers (five studies; average RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.19), but the effect was unclear in a single trial of support provided by partners.
<RES> The effects were mixed where the smoking interventions were provided as part of broader interventions to improve maternal health, rather than targeted smoking cessation interventions.
<RES> While there was no significant difference, trials where the comparison group received usual care had the largest pooled effect size (37 studies; average RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.44), with lower effect sizes when the comparison group received less intensive interventions (30 studies; average RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.31), or alternative interventions (two studies; average RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.53).
<RES> More recent studies included in this update had a lower effect size (20 studies; average RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.59), I2= 3%, compared to those in the previous version of the review (50 studies; average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.73).
<RES> There were similar effect sizes in trials with biochemically validated smoking abstinence (49 studies; average RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.67) and those with self-reported abstinence (20 studies; average RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.87).
<RES> The pooled effects were similar in interventions provided for women with predominantly low socio-economic status (44 studies; average RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.66), compared to other women (26 studies; average RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.79); though the effect was unclear in interventions among women from ethnic minority groups (five studies; average RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.40) and aboriginal women (two studies; average RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.67).
<RES> Importantly, pooled results demonstrated that women who received psychosocial interventions had an 18% reduction in preterm births (14 studies; average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96), and infants born with low birthweight (14 studies; average RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94).
<RES> There did not appear to be any adverse effects from the psychosocial interventions, and three studies measured an improvement in women's psychological wellbeing.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that calcium supplements help prevent pre-eclampsia and preterm birth and lower the risk of a woman dying or having serious problems related to high blood pressure in pregnancy.
<ABS> This is particularly for women on low calcium diets.
<ABS> Pre-eclampsia is evident as high blood pressure and protein in the urine.
<ABS> It is a major cause of death in pregnant women and newborn babies worldwide.
<ABS> Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) is often caused by high blood pressure and is the leading cause of newborn deaths, particularly in low-income countries.
<ABS> The review of 24 trials found good quality evidence that calcium supplementation with high doses (at least 1 g daily) during pregnancy (13 studies involving 15,730 women) is a safe and relatively cheap way of reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia, especially in women from communities with low dietary calcium and those at increased risk of pre-eclampsia.
<ABS> Women receiving calcium supplements were also less likely to die or have serious problems related to pre-eclampsia.
<ABS> Babies were less likely to be born preterm.
<ABS> No adverse effects have been found but further research is needed into the ideal dosage of supplementation.
<ABS> Limited evidence from 10 trials (2234 women) suggested that a relatively low dose may be effective although co-interventions such as vitamin D, linoleic acid or antioxidants were given in six of the included trials.
<ABS> In settings of low dietary calcium where high-dose supplementation is not feasible, the option of lower dose supplements (500 to 600 mg/day) might be considered in preference to no supplementation.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are common causes of serious morbidity and death.
<INT> Calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, and may help to prevent preterm birth.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We updated the search in May 2014 and added the results to the 'Awaiting Classification' section of the review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> High-dose calcium supplementation (≥1 g/day)
<RES> We included 14 studies in the review, however one study contributed no data.
<RES> We included 13 high-quality studies in our meta-analyses (15,730 women).
<RES> The average risk of high blood pressure (BP) was reduced with calcium supplementation compared with placebo (12 trials, 15,470 women: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.81; I² = 74%).
<RES> There was also a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with calcium supplementation (13 trials, 15,730 women: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.65; I² = 70%).
<RES> The effect was greatest for women with low calcium diets (eight trials, 10,678 women: average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65; I² = 76%) and women at high risk of pre-eclampsia (five trials, 587 women: average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42; I² = 0%).
<RES> These data should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of small-study effect or publication bias.
<RES> The composite outcome maternal death or serious morbidity was reduced (four trials, 9732 women; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 0%).
<RES> Maternal deaths were not significantly different (one trial of 8312 women: calcium group one death versus placebo group six deaths).
<RES> There was an anomalous increase in the risk of HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome (two trials, 12,901 women: RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.82; I² = 0%) in the calcium group, however, the absolute number of events was low (16 versus six).
<RES> The average risk of preterm birth was reduced in the calcium group (11 trials, 15,275 women: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; I² = 60%) and amongst women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia (four trials, 568 women: average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83; I² = 60%), but no significant reduction in neonatal high care admission.
<RES> There was no overall effect on the risk of stillbirth or infant death before discharge from hospital (11 trials 15,665 babies: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; I² = 0%).
<RES> One study showed a reduction in childhood systolic BP greater than 95th percentile among children exposed to calcium supplementation in utero (514 children: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.91).
<RES> In a subset of these children, dental caries at 12 years old was also reduced (195 children, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87).
<RES> Low-dose calcium supplementation (< 1 g/day)
<RES> We included 10 trials (2234 women) that evaluated low-dose supplementation with calcium alone (4) or in association with vitamin D (3), linoleic acid (2), or antioxidants (1).
<RES> Most studies recruited women at high risk for pre-eclampsia, and were at high risk of bias, thus the results should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> Supplementation with low doses of calcium significantly reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.52; I² = 0%).
<RES> There was also a reduction in hypertension, low birthweight and neonatal intensive care unit admission.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Calcium supplementation (≥ 1 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia, particularly for women with low calcium diets.
<CON> The treatment effect may be overestimated due to small-study effects or publication bias.
<CON> It also reduces preterm birth and the occurrence of the composite outcome 'maternal death or serious morbidity'.
<CON> We considered these benefits to outweigh the increased risk of HELLP syndrome, which was small in absolute numbers.
<CON> The World Health Organization recommends calcium 1.5 g to 2 g daily for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intake.
<CON> The limited evidence on low-dose calcium supplementation suggests a reduction in pre-eclampsia, but needs to be confirmed by larger, high-quality trials.
<CON> Pending such results, in settings of low dietary calcium where high-dose supplementation is not feasible, the option of lower-dose supplements (500 to 600 mg/day) might be considered in preference to no supplementation.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease of premature infants that continues to be a serious problem.
<ABS> The drug D-penicillamine, given by mouth, is commonly used to treat poisoning by iron or copper or other heavy metals.
<ABS> In research studies of D-penicillamine used for another problem that premature infants have (high bilirubin), it was observed that the treated infants had less ROP.
<ABS> However, this systematic review did not show any significant benefits of this drug for the outcomes of ROP, death or development of nerves.
<ABS> Thus, the use of this drug cannot be recommended for the prevention of ROP based on available evidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The rate of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in moderately premature infants has decreased dramatically with improved care in the neonatal intensive care unit.
<INT> A low rate of this disorder was unexpectedly observed among infants treated with intravenous D-penicillamine to prevent hyperbilirubinaemia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We used the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group search strategy.
<MaM> We updated the search on November 27, 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the criteria and standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group to assess the methodological quality of the included trials.
<MaM> One review author examined trials for validity.
<MaM> We used the standards of the Neonatal Cochrane Review Group to analyse data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three randomised trials met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> The meta-analysis showed no significant differences in the risk of any stage ROP (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 3.70), severe ROP (typical RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.26) or death (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.32) in all treated infants.
<RES> When the subgroup of infants under 1500 g birth weight was examined, the results were similar.
<RES> No side effects were reported, and follow-up at one year revealed no significant differences in spasticity or developmental delay.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> D-penicillamine cannot be recommended for the prevention of ROP based on the available evidence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute reduction in blood flow to a limb can be caused by a blood clot blocking an artery or a vascular graft.
<ABS> If not treated promptly this condition, known as peripheral arterial occlusion, can result in amputation or be life threatening.
<ABS> Infusion of clot-busting drugs can restore blood flow by dissolving the clot (thrombolysis).
<ABS> This review found some evidence from five randomized controlled trials, involving a total of 687 patients that suggested local infusion of a drug into the affected artery is more effective than infusion into a vein, and is also associated with a lower risk of unwanted bleeding.
<ABS> No particular drug was more effective in preventing limb loss or death than another.
<ABS> The drugs investigated were streptokinase, urokinase, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and pro-urokinase.
<ABS> More research is needed to confirm these findings.
<ABS> All of the findings of this review came from small studies that involved people with peripheral arterial ischaemia of differing severity.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Peripheral arterial thrombolysis is used in the management of peripheral arterial ischaemia.
<INT> Streptokinase was originally used but safety concerns led to a search for other agents.
<INT> Potential advantages of these agents include improved safety, greater efficacy and a more rapid response.
<INT> Recently drugs such as pro-urokinase, recombinant staphylokinase and alfimperase have been introduced.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2010.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five RCTs involving a total of 687 participants with a range of clinical indications were included.
<RES> No new studies were included in this update.
<RES> In one three-pronged study, vessel patency was greater with intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) than with intra-arterial streptokinase (P < 0.04) or intravenous rt-PA (P < 0.01).
<RES> In participants with peripheral arterial occlusion there was no statistically significant difference in limb salvage at 30 days with either urokinase or rt-PA, though this may reflect the small numbers in the studies.
<RES> Incidences of haemorrhagic complications varied with fibrinolytic regime but there was no statistically significant difference between intra-arterial urokinase and intra-arterial rt-PA.
<RES> In the three-pronged study intravenous rt-PA and intra-arterial streptokinase were associated with a significantly higher risk of haemorrhagic complications than with intra-arterial rt-PA (P < 0.05).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is some evidence to suggest that intra-arterial rt-PA is more effective than intra-arterial streptokinase or intravenous rt-PA in improving vessel patency in people with peripheral arterial occlusion.
<CON> There was no evidence that rt-PA was more effective than urokinase for patients with peripheral arterial occlusion and some evidence that initial lysis may be more rapid with rt-PA, depending on the regime.
<CON> Incidences of haemorrhagic complications were not statistically significantly greater with rt-PA than with other regimes.
<CON> However, all of the findings come from small studies and a general paucity of results means that it is not possible to draw clear conclusions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence that printed materials giving structured advice about how to stop smoking help people to quit.
<ABS> We looked for trials of any type of printed self-help material which gave structured support and advice about quitting.
<ABS> We also included materials in audio or video format but we did not include internet programmes or other formats.
<ABS> Trials had to include people who smoked, but they did not need to be currently trying to give up.
<ABS> We were interested in the number of people who were not smoking at least 6 months from the time when materials were provided.
<ABS> Some trials mailed materials on more than one occasion.
<ABS> Some trials gathered information about smoking history and habits in order to provide materials which were individually tailored to the characteristics of the smoker (tailored materials).
<ABS> In some trials, there was no face-to-face contact, and the materials were the only support.
<ABS> Other trials gave everyone advice and were designed to test whether there was any additional benefit from providing written materials.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This evidence is current to April 2014.
<ABS> We identified 74 studies.
<ABS> Most of them took place in North America or Europe and were conducted in adults.
<ABS> Most studies did not require that people wanted to quit smoking in order to join.
<ABS> Although some studies were judged to be at possible risk of bias, mainly because the papers did not report the methods in detail, this did not affect the overall conclusions from the review.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Based on 11 studies with over 21,000 participants, there was evidence of a small benefit of printed non-tailored structured self-help materials when provided without any other contact.
<ABS> The likelihood of quitting was increased by about 20%.
<ABS> If self help was compared to even a brief pamphlet about smoking (6 studies), there was no evidence of additional benefit from structured materials.
<ABS> When self-help materials were provided in addition to brief face-to-face contact (5 studies) or advice (11 studies), there was no longer any evidence of additional benefit compared to the effect of contact or advice alone.
<ABS> We found 31 trials which provided written materials that were individually tailored.
<ABS> Some studies compared these to no materials and some to non-tailored materials.
<ABS> There was evidence based on 9 studies with over 13,000 participants that tailored materials were of more benefit than no materials.
<ABS> There was also weaker evidence from an additional 22 studies that tailored materials were of more benefit than non-tailored materials.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> The size of benefit from self-help materials is small, with only about 1 additional successful quitter expected from 100 people receiving materials with no other support.
<ABS> Studies of this type often sent materials to people who were not trying to quit, and the number of successful quitters was low.
<ABS> Most studies also took place in countries where more intensive support was available for people wanting to quit (for example, counselling).
<ABS> People were more likely to make successful quit attempts when they had face-to-face support, but in these studies giving materials did not help increase success further.
<ABS> People who choose to use materials may find them helpful, especially if more intensive support is not available to them, but people who want to quit should be encouraged to seek more intensive support if it is available.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register.
<MaM> Date of the most recent search April 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data in duplicate on the participants, the nature of the self-help materials, the amount of face-to-face contact given to intervention and to control conditions, outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up.
<MaM> The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in people smoking at baseline.
<MaM> We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated rates when available.
<MaM> Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 74 trials which met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> Many study reports did not include sufficient detail to judge risk of bias for some domains.
<RES> Twenty-eight studies (38%) were judged at high risk of bias for one or more domains but the overall risk of bias across all included studies was judged to be moderate, and unlikely to alter the conclusions.
<RES> Thirty-four trials evaluated the effect of standard, non-tailored self-help materials.
<RES> Pooling 11 of these trials in which there was no face-to-face contact and provision of structured self-help materials was compared to no intervention gave an estimate of benefit that just reached statistical significance (n = 13,241, risk ratio [RR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.37).
<RES> This analysis excluded two trials with strongly positive outcomes that introduced significant heterogeneity.
<RES> Six further trials without face-to-face contact in which the control group received alternative written materials did not show evidence for an effect of the smoking self-help materials (n = 7023, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04).
<RES> When these two subgroups were pooled, there was no longer evidence for a benefit of standard structured materials (n = 20,264, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18).
<RES> We failed to find evidence of benefit from providing standard self-help materials when there was brief contact with all participants (5 trials, n = 3866, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42), or face-to-face advice for all participants (11 trials, n = 5365, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.18).
<RES> Thirty-one trials offered materials tailored for the characteristics of individual smokers, with controls receiving either no materials, or stage matched or non-tailored materials.
<RES> Most of the trials used more than one mailing.
<RES> Pooling these showed a benefit of tailored materials (n = 40,890, RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.37) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 32%).
<RES> The evidence is strongest for the subgroup of nine trials in which tailored materials were compared to no intervention (n = 13,437, RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.53), but also supports tailored materials as more helpful than standard materials.
<RES> Part of this effect could be due to the additional contact or assessment required to obtain individual data, since the subgroup of 10 trials where the number of contacts was matched did not detect an effect (n = 11,024, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20).
<RES> In two trials including a direct comparison between tailored materials and brief advice from a health care provider, there was no evidence of a difference, but confidence intervals were wide (n = 2992, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49).
<RES> Only four studies evaluated self-help materials as an adjunct to nicotine replacement therapy, with no evidence of additional benefit (n = 2291, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25).
<RES> A small number of other trials failed to detect benefits from using additional materials or targeted materials, or to find differences between different self-help programmes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Standard, print-based self-help materials increase quit rates compared to no intervention, but the effect is likely to be small.
<CON> We did not find evidence that they have an additional benefit when used alongside other interventions such as advice from a healthcare professional, or nicotine replacement therapy.
<CON> There is evidence that materials that are tailored for individual smokers are more effective than non-tailored materials, although the absolute size of effect is still small.
<CON> Available evidence tested self-help interventions in high income countries; further research is needed to investigate their effect in contexts where more intensive support is not available.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> 5-Fluorouracil for glaucoma surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Glaucoma involves a loss of vision that may be associated with raised pressure inside the eye.
<ABS> When glaucoma is diagnosed, it is common to try to reduce that pressure with medical, laser or surgical procedures (trabeculectomy).
<ABS> Surgery does not immediately restore vision, and may involve extra vision loss in the short term.
<ABS> Drugs can be used to modify wound healing to improve the likelihood of the success of surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This is a summary of a Cochrane review that looked at the effect of using one of these drugs, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU).
<ABS> We gathered evidence from 12 trials involving 1319 participants.
<ABS> The evidence is current to July 2013.
<ABS> 5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery
<ABS> For patients who have never had eye surgery before, 5-FU injections after surgery can slightly reduce the pressure in the eye after one year and also the risk of having more surgery in the first year.
<ABS> For patients having both cataract surgery and glaucoma surgery at the same time, no difference has been detected between injections and no injections.
<ABS> Some people are at higher risk of having problems following trabeculectomy, for instance people that have had previous surgery on the eye.
<ABS> For this group, the 5-FU injections can reduce the pressure in the eye a little and also reduce the risk of having more surgery in the first year.
<ABS> Low-dose 5-FU injections after glaucoma surgery
<ABS> Only one study has investigated the effect of using lower than normal doses in the injections.
<ABS> No benefit was found when compared to a control group who had no injections.
<ABS> 5-FU during surgery
<ABS> If 5-Fluorouracil was applied to the eye during the surgery, there was less chance of having to have more surgery within the year and the pressure in the eye was also reduced slightly at one year.
<ABS> Side effects and complications of 5-FU during or after surgery
<ABS> Complications such as damage to cells at the front of the eye or a leak from the wound seem more common when 5-FU is used.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The methodological quality of the trials was not high in general.
<ABS> In many of the studies that contributed to the evidence about 5-FU after glaucoma surgery the researchers were aware of whether the participant had received the dummy injection or the 5-FU injection.
<ABS> This may have introduced bias into the results.
<ABS> Importantly the only study contributing information about low dose 5-FU was of low methodological quality so our conclusions on low dose 5-FU must be cautious.
<ABS> The studies that contributed evidence about 5-FU during surgery was largely very good, the studies were designed and reported to a standard we would expect of modern trials.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We concluded that the main benefit is for people at high risk of problems.
<ABS> There may be a smaller benefit for people at low risk of problems if 5-FU is given either as injections after surgery or during the operation.
<ABS> However, 5-FU was found to increase the risk of serious complications and so may not be worthwhile for the small benefit gained.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Trabeculectomy is performed as a treatment for many types of glaucoma in an attempt to lower the intraocular pressure.
<INT> The surgery involves creating a channel through the sclera, through which intraocular fluid can leave the eye.
<INT> If scar tissue blocks the exit of the surgically created channel, intraocular pressure rises and the operation fails.
<INT> Antimetabolites such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) are used to inhibit wound healing to prevent the conjunctiva scarring down on to the sclera.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2009.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 25 July 2013.
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and the Science Citation Index and contacted investigators and experts for details of additional relevant trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> We contacted trial investigators for missing information.
<MaM> Data were summarised using risk ratio (RR), Peto odds ratio and mean difference, as appropriate.
<MaM> The participants were divided into three separate subgroup populations (high risk of failure, combined surgery and primary trabeculectomy) and the interventions were divided into three subgroups of 5-FU injections (intraoperative, regular dose postoperative and low dose postoperative).
<MaM> The low dose was defined as a total dose less than 19 mg.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twelve trials, which randomised 1319 participants, were included in the review.
<RES> As far as can be determined from the trial reports, the methodological quality of the trials was not high, including a high risk of detection bias in many.
<RES> Of note, only one study reported low-dose postoperative 5-FU and this paper was at high risk of reporting bias.
<RES> Not all studies reported population characteristics, of those that did mean age ranged from 61 to 75 years.
<RES> 83% of participants were white and 40% were male.
<RES> All studies were a minimum of one year long.
<RES> A significant reduction in surgical failure in the first year after trabeculectomy was detected in eyes at high risk of failure and those undergoing surgery for the first time receiving regular-dose 5-FU postoperative injections (RR 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.68 and 0.21, 0.06 to 0.68, respectively).
<RES> No surgical failures were detected in studies assessing combined surgery.
<RES> No difference was detected in the low-dose postoperative 5-FU injection group in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.24).
<RES> Peroperative 5-FU in patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy significantly reduced risk of failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.88).
<RES> This translates to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome of 4.1 for the high risk of failure patients, and 5.0 for primary trabeculectomy patients receiving postoperative 5-FU.
<RES> Intraocular pressure was also reduced in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving intraoperative 5-FU (mean difference (MD) -1.04, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.43) and regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -4.67, 95% CI -6.60 to -2.73).
<RES> No significant change occurred in the primary trabeculectomy group receiving low-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -0.50, 95% CI -2.96 to 1.96).
<RES> Intraocular pressure was particularly reduced in the high risk of failure population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -16.30, 95% CI -18.63 to -13.97).
<RES> No difference was detected in the combined surgery population receiving regular-dose postoperative 5-FU (MD -1.02, 95% CI -2.40 to 0.37).
<RES> Whilst no evidence was found of an increased risk of serious sight-threatening complications, other complications are more common after 5-FU injections.
<RES> None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care.
<RES> The quality of evidence varied between subgroups and outcomes, most notably the evidence for combined surgery and low-dose postoperative 5-FU was found to be very low using GRADE.
<RES> The combined surgery postoperative 5-FU subgroup because no surgical failures have been reported and the sample size is small (n = 118), and the low-dose postoperative 5-FU group because of the small sample size (n = 76) and high risk of bias of the only contributing study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Postoperative injections of 5-FU are now rarely used as part of routine packages of postoperative care but are increasingly used on an ad hoc basis.
<CON> This presumably reflects an aspect of the treatment that is unacceptable to both patients and doctors.
<CON> None of the trials reported on the participants' perspective of care, which constitutes a serious omission for an invasive treatment such as this.
<CON> The small but statistically significant reduction in surgical failures and intraocular pressure at one year in the primary trabeculectomy group and high-risk group must be weighed against the increased risk of complications and patient preference.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When people undergo surgical operations of their abdomen they are at risk of infection which will often be cured by an antibiotic.
<ABS> However, it might be better to give this before the operation to prevent the infection (prophylaxis or prophylactic use), rather than wait until an infection occurs before giving it.
<ABS> This review looks at the evidence for giving an antibiotic before surgery takes place.
<ABS> The review found 260 studies which had recruited over 43 thousand people undergoing abdominal surgery.
<ABS> The studies had some limitations in relation to the number of people who remained in the studies and the possibility that the results were affected because some of the researchers in the studies knew which people had received antibiotics before surgery.
<ABS> However, when the results were analysed effect of prophylactic antibiotics was consistently beneficial meaning that these limitations were unlikely to have had a major impact on the nature of the overall results.
<ABS> Abdominal surgical wound infection in patients having operations on the large intestine occurs in about 40% of patients if antibiotics are not given.
<ABS> This risk can be greatly diminished by the administration of antibiotics prophylactically before surgery. .
<ABS> The antibiotic(s) given usuallly needs to cover different types of bacteria some of which need oxygen (aerobic bacteria) and others which do not need oxygen (anaerobic bacteria)..
<ABS> They are usually given via a canula injected into a vein, though there is evidence that a combination of oral and intravenous antibiotics may provide more protection.
<ABS> This last finding raises a problem in that current clinical practice is to avoid mechanical cleansing of the colon because it is not thought to be necessary before surgery (and not popular with patients).
<ABS> Studies that found a benefit to oral antibiotics were done at a time when mechanical cleansing of the colon was routinely done.
<ABS> In the light of current practice regarding mechanical cleansing before surgery of the colon, the benefit of oral antibiotics is uncertain.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Research shows that administration of prophylactic antibiotics before colorectal surgery prevents postoperative surgical wound infection.
<INT> The best antibiotic choice, timing of administration and route of administration remain undetermined.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Specifically to determine:

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> For the original review published in 2009 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid).
<MaM> For the update of this review we rewrote the search strategies and extended the search to cover from 1954 for MEDLINE and 1974 for EMBASE up to 7 January 2013.
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL on the same date (Issue 12, 2012).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This updated review includes 260 trials and 68 different antibiotics, including 24 cephalosporins and 43,451 participants.
<RES> Many studies had multiple variables that separated the two study groups; these could not be compared to other studies that tested one antibiotic and had a single variable separating the two groups.
<RES> We did not consider the risk of bias arising from attrition and lack of blinding of outcome assessors to affect the results for surgical wound infection.
<RES> Meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically significant difference in postoperative surgical wound infection when prophylactic antibiotics were compared to placebo/no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.41, high quality evidence).
<RES> This translates to a reduction in risk from 39% to 13% with prophylactic antibiotics.
<RES> The slightly higher risk of wound infection with short-term compared with long-term duration antibiotic did not reach statistical significance (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.30).
<RES> Similarly risk of would infection was slightly higher with single-dose antibiotics when compared with multiple dose antibiotics, but the results are compatible with benefit and harm (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.10).
<RES> Additional aerobic coverage and additional anaerobic coverage both showed statistically significant improvements in surgical wound infection rates (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68 and RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71, respectively), as did combined oral and intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis when compared to intravenous alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.74), or oral alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.76).
<RES> Comparison of an antibiotic with anaerobic specificity to one with aerobic specificity showed no significant advantage for either one (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.36).
<RES> Two small studies compared giving antibiotics before or after surgery and no significant difference in this timing was found (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.15).
<RES> Established gold-standard regimens recommended in major guidelines were no less effective than any other antibiotic choice.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It is not known whether oral antibiotics would still have these effects when the colon is not empty.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What are hip protectors?
<ABS> Older people living in nursing care facilities or older adults living at home are at high risk of falling and a hip fracture may occur after a fall.
<ABS> Hip protectors are plastic shields (hard) or foam pads (soft), usually fitted in pockets in specially designed underwear.
<ABS> They are worn to cushion a sideways fall on the hip.
<ABS> Do they prevent hip fractures?
<ABS> We conducted a review of the effect of hip protectors to prevent hip fractures.
<ABS> We searched for all relevant studies up to December 2012.
<ABS> We found 19 studies with about 17,000 people who were around 80 years old.
<ABS> Overall, there was moderate quality evidence from these studies for the following results.
<ABS> When wearing the hip protectors very few people had side effects, such as skin irritation.
<ABS> However, people often did not wear the hip protectors when they were provided.
<ABS> Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Older people living in nursing care facilities or older adults living at home are at high risk of falling and a hip fracture may occur after a fall.
<INT> Hip protectors have been advocated as a means to reduce the risk of hip fracture.
<INT> Hip protectors are plastic shields (hard) or foam pads (soft), usually fitted in pockets in specially designed underwear.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1999, and updated several times, most recently in 2010.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> We sought additional information from trialists.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review includes 19 studies, nine of which were cluster randomised.
<RES> These included approximately 17,000 people (mean age range 78 to 86 years).
<RES> Most studies were overall at low risk of bias for fracture outcomes.
<RES> Trials tested hard or soft hip protectors enclosed in special underwear in 18 studies.
<RES> Pooling of data from 14 studies (11,808 participants) conducted in nursing or residential care settings found moderate quality evidence for a small reduction in hip fracture risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.00); the absolute effect is 11 fewer people (95% CI, from 20 fewer to 0) per 1000 having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> There is moderate quality evidence when pooling data from five trials in the community (5614 participants) that shows little or no effect in hip fracture risk (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.58); the absolute effect is two more people (95% CI 2 fewer to 6 more) per 1000 people having a hip fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> There is probably little to no effect on falls (rate ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.16) or fractures other than of the hip or pelvis (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07).
<RES> However, the risk ratio for pelvic fractures is RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.78 to 2.08); this is an absolute effect of one more person (95% CI 1 fewer to 5 more) per 1000 having a pelvic fracture when provided with hip protectors.
<RES> The incidence of adverse events while wearing hip protectors, including skin irritation, ranged from 0% to 5%.
<RES> Adherence, particularly in the long term, was poor.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, hip protectors may slightly increase the small risk of pelvic fractures.
<CON> Poor acceptance and adherence by older people offered hip protectors is a barrier to their use.
<CON> Better understanding is needed of the personal and design factors that may influence acceptance and adherence.

<H1> Carbamazepine for schizophrenia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Carbamazepine for schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia will often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions).
<ABS> They may also experience apathy, tiredness, lack of drive and disorganised thoughts and behaviour.
<ABS> These symptoms make schizophrenia a severe illness that affects many people throughout their life.
<ABS> The main treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication.
<ABS> However, although this medication is successful in treating the majority of people, 5% to 15% will continue to suffer from debilitating symptoms.
<ABS> For these people, several treatment options are available: changing the dose of medication; switching to another antipsychotic drug; or taking additional drugs that are not antipsychotics.
<ABS> Carbamazepine is a drug first used to treat epilepsy in the 1950s.
<ABS> It is also used as a mood stabiliser when people change between ‘high’ and ‘low’ moods (for example bi-polar affective disorder).
<ABS> Side effects of carbamazepine include: poor coordination, headaches and drowsiness.
<ABS> This review focuses on the effectiveness of carbamazepine for people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> A search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register was carried out July 2012.
<ABS> Ten studies were found with 283 people.
<ABS> Carbamazepine was compared with no active medication (‘dummy’ or placebo treatment), versus an antipsychotic or when taken in addition to an antipsychotic.
<ABS> However, all of the 10 studies were small and information in them was of a poor standard.
<ABS> There is therefore a lack of evidence whether carbamazepine reduces symptoms and side effects in people with schizophrenia or similar mental health problems.
<ABS> Larger well-designed trials are necessary to provide stronger evidence before carbamazepine can be recommended as a treatment for people with schizophrenia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> For the original version we searched The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials (December 2001), The Cochrane Library (Issue 3, 2001), MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), Biological Abstracts (1980-2001), PsycLIT (1886-2001) and PSYNDEX (1974-2001).
<MaM> For the most recent update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials in July 2012.
<MaM> We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional data.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data independently.
<MaM> For homogenous dichotomous data we calculated fixed-effect, risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis.
<MaM> For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD).
<MaM> We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The updated search did not reveal any further studies that met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> The number of included studies therefore remains at 10 with the number of participants randomised still 283.
<RES> One study comparing carbamazepine with placebo as the sole treatment for schizophrenia was abandoned early due to high relapse rate with 26 out of 31 participants relapsing by three months.
<RES> No effect of carbamazepine was evident with no difference in relapse between the two groups (1 RCT n = 31, RR 1.07 CI 0.78 to 1.45).
<RES> Another study compared carbamazepine with antipsychotics as the sole treatment for schizophrenia.
<RES> No differences in terms of mental state were found when comparing 50% reduction in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores (1 RCT n = 38, RR 1.23 CI 0.78 to 1.92).
<RES> A favourable effect for carbamazepine was found when more people who received the antipsychotic (perphenazine) had parkinsonism (1 RCT n = 38, RR 0.03 CI 0.00 to 0.043).
<RES> Eight studies compared adjunctive carbamazepine versus adjunctive placebo, we were able use GRADE for quality of evidence for these results.
<RES> Adding carbamazepine to antipsychotic treatment was as acceptable as adding placebo with no difference between the numbers leaving the study early from each group (8 RCTs n = 182, RR 0.47 CI 0.16 to 1.35, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Carbamazepine augmentation was superior compared with antipsychotics alone in terms of overall global improvement, but participant numbers were low (2 RCTs n = 38, RR 0.57 CI 0.37 to 0.88).
<RES> There were no differences for the mental state outcome of 50% reduction in BPRS scores (6 RCTs n = 147, RR 0.86 CI 0.67 to 1.12, low quality evidence).
<RES> Less people in the carbamazepine augmentation group had movement disorders than those taking haloperidol alone (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.38 CI 0.14 to 1.02).
<RES> No data were available for the effects of carbamazepine on subgroups of people with schizophrenia and aggressive behaviour, negative symptoms or EEG abnormalities or with schizoaffective disorder.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Bronchodilators for bronchiolitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is bronchiolitis?
<ABS> Bronchiolitis is an acute, highly contagious, viral infection of the lungs that is common in infants 0 to 12 months of age.
<ABS> It occurs every year in the winter months.
<ABS> It causes the small airways in the lungs to become inflamed and fill with debris.
<ABS> The airways are narrowed and this leads to blocking of the free passage of air.
<ABS> The infant has a harsh cough, runny nose and usually a fever.
<ABS> S/he can become breathless, wheezy and short of oxygen.
<ABS> Why review bronchodilators?
<ABS> Bronchodilators are drugs often used as aerosols to widen the air passages by relaxing the bronchial muscle.
<ABS> They are effective in helping older children and adults with asthma.
<ABS> However, unlike asthmatics, infants with bronchiolitis are usually wheezing for the first time.
<ABS> They are wheezing for a different reason, that is to say, because their airways are clogged with debris.
<ABS> Therefore, infants with bronchiolitis are less likely to respond to bronchodilators.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of bronchodilators in infants with bronchiolitis.
<ABS> We found 30 trials that included a total of 1922 infants, in several countries.
<ABS> The evidence is current up to January 2014.
<ABS> We analyzed studies done in outpatient and inpatient settings separately.
<ABS> All bronchodilators were included in the review except for epinephrine because it is reviewed in another Cochrane review.
<ABS> Albuterol (otherwise known as salbutamol) is commonly used in studies, so we also reviewed this bronchodilator as a subgroup.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no effect of bronchodilators on oxygen saturation.
<ABS> Infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis showed no significant benefit of bronchodilator treatment.
<ABS> This review also found that bronchodilators do not reduce the need for hospitalization, do not shorten the length of stay in hospital and do not shorten the length of the illness at home.
<ABS> Reviewing the subgroup of studies using albuterol (salbutamol), we found no effect of this bronchodilator on oxygen saturation or clinical scores.
<ABS> Side effects of bronchodilators include rapid heart beat, decrease in oxygen and shakiness.
<ABS> Given these side effects, little evidence that they are effective and the expense associated with these treatments, bronchodilators are not helpful in the management of bronchiolitis.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review is limited by the small number of studies that use the same measures and methods.
<ABS> For example, only 22 studies included only infants wheezing for the first time.
<ABS> Older studies included children who had wheezed before and may have had asthma.
<ABS> Thus these older studies favor the use of bronchodilators.
<ABS> Newer studies that excluded infants with prior wheezing and had a better study design do not show a benefit of bronchodilators.
<ABS> This review is also limited by the small number of infants included in each study.
<ABS> Lastly, clinical scores used to measure the effect of the bronchodilators in some studies may vary from one observer to the next, making this measure unreliable.
<ABS> Studies that include more infants, use better measures and have a stronger study design are needed to define the effectiveness of these medications.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of bronchodilators on clinical outcomes in infants (0 to 12 months) with acute bronchiolitis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 30 trials (35 data sets) representing 1992 infants with bronchiolitis.
<RES> In 11 inpatient and 10 outpatient studies, oxygen saturation did not improve with bronchodilators (mean difference (MD) -0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to 0.06, n = 1242).
<RES> Outpatient bronchodilator treatment did not reduce the rate of hospitalization (11.9% in bronchodilator group versus 15.9% in placebo group, odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.21, n = 710).
<RES> Inpatient bronchodilator treatment did not reduce the duration of hospitalization (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.39, n = 349).
<RES> Effect estimates for inpatients (MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.16) were slightly larger than for outpatients (MD -0.25, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.11) for oximetry.
<RES> Oximetry outcomes showed significant heterogeneity (I2 statistic = 81%).
<RES> Including only studies with low risk of bias had little impact on the overall effect size of oximetry (MD -0.38, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.00) but results were close to statistical significance.
<RES> In eight inpatient studies, there was no change in average clinical score (standardized MD (SMD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.12) with bronchodilators.
<RES> In nine outpatient studies, the average clinical score decreased slightly with bronchodilators (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06), a statistically significant finding of questionable clinical importance.
<RES> The clinical score outcome showed significant heterogeneity (I2 statistic = 73%).
<RES> Including only studies with low risk of bias reduced the heterogeneity but had little impact on the overall effect size of average clinical score (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.03).
<RES> Sub-analyses limited to nebulized albuterol or salbutamol among outpatients (nine studies) showed no effect on oxygen saturation (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.21, n = 572), average clinical score (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.11, n = 532) or hospital admission after treatment (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33, n = 404).
<RES> Adverse effects included tachycardia, oxygen desaturation and tremors.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Bronchodilators such as albuterol or salbutamol do not improve oxygen saturation, do not reduce hospital admission after outpatient treatment, do not shorten the duration of hospitalization and do not reduce the time to resolution of illness at home.
<CON> Given the adverse side effects and the expense associated with these treatments, bronchodilators are not effective in the routine management of bronchiolitis.
<CON> This meta-analysis continues to be limited by the small sample sizes and the lack of standardized study design and validated outcomes across the studies.
<CON> Future trials with large sample sizes, standardized methodology across clinical sites and consistent assessment methods are needed to answer completely the question of efficacy.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Vaccines for preventing influenza in healthy adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We evaluated the effect of immunisation with influenza vaccines on preventing influenza A or B infections (efficacy), influenza-like illness (ILI) and its consequences (effectiveness), and determined whether exposure to influenza vaccines is associated with serious or severe harms.
<ABS> The target populations were healthy adults, including pregnant women and newborns.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Over 200 viruses cause influenza and ILI, producing the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches, pains, cough and runny noses).
<ABS> Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot distinguish between them as both last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness.
<ABS> At best, vaccines may only be effective against influenza A and B, which represent about 10% of all circulating viruses.
<ABS> Annually, the World Health Organization estimates which viral strains should be included in the next season's vaccinations.
<ABS> Inactivated vaccine is prepared by treating influenza viruses with a specific chemical agent that “kills” the virus.
<ABS> Final preparations can contain either the complete viruses (whole vaccine) or the active part of them (split or subunit vaccines).
<ABS> These kind of vaccines are normally intramuscularly administered (parenteral route)
<ABS> Live attenuated vaccines is prepared by growing the influenza viruses through a series of cell cultures or animal embryos.
<ABS> With each passage, the viruses lose their ability to replicate in human cells but can still stimulate the immune system.
<ABS> Live attenuated vaccine are administered as aerosol in the nostrils (intranasal route).
<ABS> The virus strains contained in the vaccine are usually those that are expected to circulate in the following epidemic seasons (two type A and one B strains), accordingly to the recommendations of the World Health Organization (seasonal vaccine).
<ABS> Pandemic vaccine contains only the virus strain that is responsible of the pandemic (i.e. the type A H1N1 for the 2009/2010 pandemic).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.
<ABS> In this update, 90 reports of 116 studies compared the effect of influenza vaccine with placebo or no intervention.
<ABS> Sixty-nine reports were clinical trials (over 70,000 people), 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case-control studies (nearly 25,000 people).
<ABS> Of the 116 studies, 23 (three case-control and 20 cohort studies) were performed during pregnancy (about 1.6 million mother-child couples).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The preventive effect of parenteral inactivated influenza vaccine on healthy adults is small: at least 40 people would need vaccination to avoid one ILI case (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128) and 71 people would need vaccination to prevent one case of influenza (95% CI 64 to 80).
<ABS> Vaccination shows no appreciable effect on working days lost or hospitalisation.
<ABS> The protection against ILI that is given by the administration of inactivated influenza vaccine to pregnant women is uncertain or at least very limited; the effect on their newborns is not statistically significant.
<ABS> The effectiveness of live aerosol vaccines on healthy adults is similar to inactivated vaccines: 46 people (95% CI 29 to 115) would need immunisation to avoid one ILI case.
<ABS> The administration of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is not associated with the onset of multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve of the eye) or immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (a disease that affects blood platelets).
<ABS> The administration of pandemic monovalent H1N1 inactivated vaccine is not associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (a disease that affects the nerves of the limbs and body).
<ABS> Evidence suggests that the administration of both seasonal and 2009 pandemic vaccines during pregnancy has no significant effect on abortion or neonatal death.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The real impact of biases could not be determined for about 70% of the included studies (e.g. insufficient reporting details, very different scores among the items evaluated).
<ABS> About 20% of the included studies (mainly cohorts) had a high risk of bias.
<ABS> Just under 10% had good methodological quality.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Different types of influenza vaccines are currently produced worldwide.
<INT> Vaccination of pregnant women is recommended internationally, while healthy adults are targeted in North America.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2013) and EMBASE (1990 to May 2013).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccines with placebo or no intervention in naturally occurring influenza in healthy individuals aged 16 to 65 years.
<MaM> We also included comparative studies assessing serious and rare harms.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 90 reports containing 116 data sets; among these 69 were clinical trials of over 70,000 people, 27 were comparative cohort studies (about eight million people) and 20 were case-control studies (nearly 25,000 people).
<RES> We retrieved 23 reports of the effectiveness and safety of vaccine administration in pregnant women (about 1.6 million mother-child couples).
<RES> The overall effectiveness of parenteral inactivated vaccine against influenza-like illness (ILI) is limited, corresponding to a number needed to vaccinate (NNV) of 40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 26 to 128).
<RES> The overall efficacy of inactivated vaccines in preventing confirmed influenza has a NNV of 71 (95% CI 64 to 80).
<RES> The difference between these two values depends on the different incidence of ILI and confirmed influenza among the study populations: 15.6% of unvaccinated participants versus 9.9% of vaccinated participants developed ILI symptoms, whilst only 2.4% and 1.1%, respectively, developed laboratory-confirmed influenza.
<RES> No RCTs assessing vaccination in pregnant women were found.
<RES> The only evidence available comes from observational studies with modest methodological quality.
<RES> On this basis, vaccination shows very limited effects: NNV 92 (95% CI 63 to 201) against ILI in pregnant women and NNV 27 (95% CI 18 to 185) against laboratory-confirmed influenza in newborns from vaccinated women.
<RES> Live aerosol vaccines have an overall effectiveness corresponding to a NNV 46 (95% CI 29 to 115).
<RES> The performance of one-dose or two-dose whole virion pandemic vaccines was higher, showing a NNV of 16 (95% CI 14 to 20) against ILI and a NNV of 35 (95% CI 33 to 47) against influenza, while a limited impact on hospitalisation was found (NNV 94, 95% CI 70 to 1022).
<RES> Vaccination had a modest effect on time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates.
<RES> Inactivated vaccines caused local harms.
<RES> No evidence of association with serious adverse events was found, but the harms evidence base was limited.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in the included trials is unclear because it was not possible to assess the real impact of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Influenza vaccines have a very modest effect in reducing influenza symptoms and working days lost in the general population, including pregnant women.
<CON> No evidence of association between influenza vaccination and serious adverse events was found in the comparative studies considered in the review.
<CON> This review includes 90 studies, 24 of which (26.7%) were funded totally or partially by industry.
<CON> Out of the 48 RCTs, 17 were industry-funded (35.4%).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Breathing exercises for adults with asthma

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Breathing exercises for asthma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The high prevalence of asthma worldwide is a major public health problem because of the high healthcare costs associated with hospitalisation and medication.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wanted to look at available evidence for the effectiveness of breathing exercises in adults with asthma.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 13 studies involving 906 adults with mild to moderate asthma.
<ABS> Eleven studies compared breathing exercises with inactive controls and two with asthma education control groups.
<ABS> Overall, improvements in quality of life, asthma symptoms and numbers of exacerbations were reported.
<ABS> Six of the eleven studies that assessed lung function showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises.
<ABS> No adverse effects related to the intervention were described, which indicates that this is a safe and well-tolerated intervention in people with asthma.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The trials were different in terms of type of breathing exercises performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data.
<ABS> As a result, we were not able to compare the results from these trials using a meta-analysis for all outcomes.
<ABS> Meta-analysis was possible for only two outcomes (asthma symptoms and change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire—AQLQ), each of which was reported in only two studies.
<ABS> Both meta-analyses showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises.
<ABS> The methods used to conduct these studies were not as well reported as we would have liked, and so the quality of the trials was unclear.
<ABS> Overall the quality of the evidence included in the review was very low.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no conclusive evidence in this review supports or refutes the efficacy of such intervention in the treatment of adult patients with asthma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Trial registers and reference lists of included articles were also consulted.
<MaM> The literature search has been updated to January 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> RevMan software was used for data analysis based on the fixed-effect model.
<MaM> Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MDs) with confidence intervals (CIs) of 95%.
<MaM> Heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots.
<MaM> The Chi2 test was applied, with a P value of 0.10 indicating statistical significance.
<MaM> The I2 statistic was implemented, with a value greater than 50% representing a substantial level of heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 13 studies involving 906 participants are included in the review.
<RES> The trials were different from one another in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data.
<RES> Asthma severity in participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, and the samples consisted solely of outpatients.
<RES> The following outcomes were measured: quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of acute exacerbations and lung function.
<RES> Eleven studies compared breathing exercise with inactive control, and two with asthma education control groups.
<RES> All eight studies that assessed quality of life reported an improvement in this outcome.
<RES> An improvement in the number of acute exacerbations was observed by the only study that assessed this outcome.
<RES> Six of seven included studies showed significant differences favouring breathing exercises for asthma symptoms.
<RES> Effects on lung function were more variable, with no difference reported in five of the eleven studies that assessed this outcome, while the other six showed a significant difference for this outcome, which favoured breathing exercises.
<RES> As a result of substantial heterogeneity among the studies, meta-analysis was possible only for asthma symptoms and changes in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ).
<RES> Each meta-analysis included only two studies and showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13 for asthma symptoms; MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08 for change in AQLQ).
<RES> Assessment of risk of bias was impaired by incomplete reporting of methodological aspects of most of the included trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no reliable conclusions could be drawn concerning the use of breathing exercises for asthma in clinical practice.
<CON> This was a result of methodological differences among the included studies and poor reporting of methodological aspects in most of the included studies.
<CON> However, trends for improvement are encouraging, and further studies including full descriptions of treatment methods and outcome measurements are required.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in The Cochrane Library 2000, Issue 4.
<ABS> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the nervous system.
<ABS> Focal inflammation impairs the ability of white matter tracts to conduct electrical impulses and produces acute episodes of neurological dysfunction called relapses.
<ABS> During a relapse of the disease, the symptoms may cause different levels of impairment with variable recovery.
<ABS> Relapse-related sequelae may accumulate during the course of the disease and cause permanent disability.
<ABS> Disability is commonly evaluated according to the Kurtzke scale, which is scored over a range of 10 points (0 = no disability, 10 = death).
<ABS> Prevention of long-term morbidity was also evaluated.
<ABS> Secondary objectives were to assess the safety and efficacy of different types of drugs and different schedules of treatment.
<ABS> Six studies published between 1961 and 1998 have been included, with a total of 377 participants.
<ABS> The main results of this review show that corticosteroids (methylprednisolone (MP)) or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation, increasing by more than 60% the probability of ameliorating the episode within the first five weeks of treatment.
<ABS> Clinical recovery was found to be accelerated and reduction of disability was assessed as a 1.5-point change in EDSS score during the first week of therapy.
<ABS> The quality of evidence was moderate.
<ABS> The drugs were well tolerated.
<ABS> No clear data on long-term effects were found.
<ABS> Evidence on the efficacy of different types or schedules of therapies was limited.
<ABS> Indirect comparisons suggest a significantly greater effect of MP versus ACTH.
<ABS> A short-term course (5 days) of MP seems to be more effective than long-term treatment (15 days).
<ABS> The interval between exacerbation onset and the start of treatment does not seem to influence the outcome.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Corticosteroids are commonly used to improve the rate of recovery from acute exacerbation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
<INT> This review is un update of the Cochrane Review, "Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis," first published in The Cochrane Library 2000, Issue 4.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Primary objectives were to determine the effects of corticosteroids and ACTH for the treatment of MS patients with acute exacerbation in terms of improvement of disability; reduction of risk of new exacerbations during follow-up; and prevention of disability progression at long-term follow-up.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The review authors undertook handsearching and contacted trialists and pharmaceutical companies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved by consensus among review authors.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six trials, published between 1961 and 1998, contributed to this review.
<RES> The current update did not identify new trials.
<RES> A total of 377 participants (199 treatment, 178 placebo) were randomly assigned.
<RES> The drugs analysed were methylprednisolone (MP) (four trials, 140 participants) and ACTH (two trials, 237 participants).
<RES> Overall, administration of MP or ACTH favoured recovery from acute exacerbation in MS participants: use of either agent decreased by more than 60% the probability of the condition getting worse or stable within the first five weeks of treatment (odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.24 to 0.57; reduced disability of 1.5 points in the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at the first week of therapy, mean difference -1.47, 95% CI -2.25 to -0.69).
<RES> The overall quality of evidence according to GRADE levels was moderate.
<RES> Evidence was insufficient to show whether steroids or ACTH treatment prevented new exacerbations and worsening of long-term disability.
<RES> The time interval from onset of exacerbation to start of treatment administration does not seem to influence the outcome.
<RES> Short-term (five days) courses of intravenous MP seem to be more effective than long-term treatment (15 days) (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.75 vs OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.57).
<RES> No data are available beyond one year of follow-up to allow evaluation of any effect on long-term progression.
<RES> One study reported that short-term treatment with intravenous high-dose MP was not associated with adverse events.
<RES> However, gastrointestinal symptoms and affective disorders were significantly more common in the oral high-dose MP group than in the placebo group.
<RES> Weight gain and edema were significantly more frequent in the ACTH group than among controls.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Data were insufficient to permit reliable estimation of the effects of corticosteroids on prevention of new exacerbations and long-term disability.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: This Cochrane review has evaluated whether phytoestrogen treatments reduce the number and severity of hot flushes and whether they are safe and acceptable.
<ABS> Background: Hormone therapy is an effective treatment for controlling the most common menopausal symptoms—hot flushes and night sweats.
<ABS> However, it is now recommended only in low doses given for the shortest possible time because of concerns about increased risk of some chronic diseases.
<ABS> Many women have started to use therapies that they perceive as 'natural' and safe, but they often do not have good information about the potential benefits and risks.
<ABS> Some of these therapies contain phytoestrogens—a group of plant-derived chemicals that are thought to prevent or treat disease.
<ABS> Phytoestrogens are found in a wide variety of plants, some of which are foods, particularly soy, alfalfa and red clover.
<ABS> Study characteristics: This review found 43 RCTs conducted up to July 2013 that included 4,084 participants with hot flushes who were close to the menopause or were menopausal.
<ABS> Evidence obtained is current to July 2013.
<ABS> Key results: Some trials reported a slight reduction in hot flushes and night sweats with phytoestrogen-based treatment.
<ABS> Extracts containing high levels of genistein (a substance derived from soy) appeared to reduce the number of daily hot flushes and need to be investigated further.
<ABS> Overall no indication suggested that other types of phytoestrogens work any better than no treatment.
<ABS> No evidence was found of harmful effects on the lining of the womb, stimulation of the vagina or other adverse effects with short-term use.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: Many of the trials in this review were small, of short duration and of poor quality, and the types of phytoestrogens used varied substantially.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes and night sweats, are very common during the menopausal transition.
<INT> Hormone therapy has traditionally been used as a highly effective treatment, but concerns about increased risk of some chronic diseases have markedly increased the interest of women in alternative treatments.
<INT> Some of the most popular of these treatments are foods or supplements enriched with phytoestrogens—plant-derived chemicals that have estrogenic action.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Searches targeted the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of randomised trials (29 July 2013), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 29 July 2013), MEDLINE (inception to 29 July 2013), EMBASE (inception to 29 July 2013), AMED (1985 to 29 July 2013), PsycINFO (inception to 29 July 2013) and CINAHL (inception to 29 July 2013).
<MaM> Attempts were made to access grey literature by sending letters to pharmaceutical companies and performing searches of ongoing trial registers.
<MaM> Reference lists of included trials were also searched.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials that included women who had breast cancer or a history of breast cancer were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Selection of trials, extraction of data and assessment of quality were undertaken by at least two review authors.
<MaM> Studies were grouped into broad categories: dietary soy, soy extracts, red clover extracts, genistein extracts and other types of phytoestrogens.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 43 randomised controlled trials (4,364 participants) were included in this review.
<RES> Very few trials provided data suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis.
<RES> Individual results from the remaining trials were compared in broad subgroups such as dietary soy, soy extracts and other types of phytoestrogens that could not be combined.
<RES> Some of these trials found that phytoestrogen treatments alleviated the frequency and severity of hot flushes and night sweats when compared with placebo, but many trials were small and were determined to be at high risk of bias.
<RES> A strong placebo effect was noted in most trials, with a reduction in frequency ranging from 1% to 59% with placebo.
<RES> No indication suggested that discrepant results were due to the amount of isoflavone in the active treatment arm, the severity of vasomotor symptoms or trial quality factors.
<RES> Also, no evidence indicated that these treatments caused oestrogenic stimulation of the endometrium or the vagina or other adverse effects when used for up to two years.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Zonisamide in combination with another antiepileptic drug can reduce seizures, but with some adverse effects.
<ABS> Around 70% of epileptic patients can become seizure-free with antiepileptic drug treatment.
<ABS> The remaining 30% of people with epilepsy may be resistant to antiepileptic drugs and still experience seizures.
<ABS> Older drugs do not prevent seizures for everyone and they have adverse effects.
<ABS> New drugs have been developed to try to treat those people who are resistant to the old drugs and to try to limit the adverse effects.
<ABS> These newer drugs are taken as well as the patient's existing medication, as an 'add-on' treatment.
<ABS> Zonisamide is used as an add-on treatment.
<ABS> A search of databases was carried out on 12/02/2013.
<ABS> Five trials were found which included 949 people with partial epilepsy.
<ABS> These trials were all randomised controlled trials which compared the antiepileptic drug Zonisamide to a placebo drug for a period of 12 weeks.
<ABS> Taking all the evidence of the trials into account, the review found that seizure frequency was significantly reduced for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy if zonisamide is added to their usual treatment.
<ABS> Patients treated with 300 to 500 mg/day of zonisamide were twice as likely as people given placebo tablets in addition to their usual treatment to experience at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of their seizures.
<ABS> However, adding zonisamide to the usual treatment is associated with an increase in adverse effects such as problems with co-ordination (ataxia), drowsiness (somnolence), agitation and anorexia.
<ABS> The trials were assessed with regards to bias and quality and overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as high quality.
<ABS> However more research is need which concentrates on examining the dose of zonisamide.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures can be well controlled with the use of a single antiepileptic agent, but up to 30% develop refractory epilepsy, especially those with partial seizures.
<INT> In this review we summarise the current evidence regarding zonisamide, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> 2013, Issue 1) (January 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 12 February 2013), SCOPUS (13 February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (12 February 2013) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP (13 February 2013).
<MaM> In addition, we contacted Eisai Limited (makers and licensees of zonisamide) and experts in the field to seek any ongoing/unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data.
<MaM> Outcomes were: (1) 50% or greater reduction in total seizure frequency; (2) treatment withdrawal; (3) adverse effects.
<MaM> Primary analyses were intention-to-treat.
<MaM> We estimated summary risk ratios (RRs) for each outcome.
<MaM> All studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and presented in a summary of findings table.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five trials (949 participants) were included.
<RES> The overall RR with 95% confidence interval (CI) for 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for 300 to 500 mg/day of zonisamide was 2.00 (95% CI 1.58 to 2.54).
<RES> The RR for 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo for any dose of zonisamide (100 to 500 mg per day) was 1.92 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.42).
<RES> The number needed to treat (NNT) was 6 for this outcome.
<RES> Two trials provide evidence of a dose response relationship for this outcome.
<RES> The RR for treatment withdrawal for 300 to 500 mg/day of zonisamide compared to placebo was 1.64 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.25) and for 100 to 500 mg per day was 1.47 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.01).
<RES> NNT for this outcome was 21.
<RES> The CIs of the following adverse effects indicate that they are significantly associated with zonisamide: ataxia 3.77 (99% CI 1.28 to 11.11); somnolence 1.83 (99% CI 1.08 to 3.11); agitation 2.35 (99% CI 1.05 to 5.27) and anorexia 2.71 (99% CI 1.29 to 5.69).
<RES> Across the 5 studies, risk of bias domains were rated as low is bias or unclear.
<RES> None of the evidence for outcomes was downgraded for quality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Zonisamide has efficacy as an add-on treatment in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<CON> In this review minimum effective and maximum tolerated doses cannot be identified.
<CON> The trials reviewed were of a maximum stable-dose phase of 18 weeks in duration and results cannot be used to confirm longer periods of effectiveness in seizure control.
<CON> The results cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or to people with other seizure types or epilepsy syndromes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Topiramate is effective as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<ABS> Epilepsy is a disorder where recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain.
<ABS> Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug.
<ABS> Unfortunately some people require more than one antiepileptic medication to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of being generalised.
<ABS> We carried out a search of databases on 18 June 2013.
<ABS> Eleven trials were found which included 1401 people with partial epilepsy.
<ABS> These trials were all randomised controlled trials which compared the antiepileptic drug topiramate to a placebo drug for a period of up to 18 weeks.
<ABS> Taking all the evidence of the trials into account, the review found that topiramate is three times more effective when used with other drugs than placebo to reduce the number of seizures in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<ABS> However, adding topiramate to the usual treatment is associated with an increase in side effects such as problems with co-ordination (ataxia), concentration, dizziness, drowsiness (somnolence), fatigue, nausea, 'thinking abnormally', tickling or numbness of the skin (paraesthesia) and weight loss.
<ABS> We assessed the trials with regards to bias and quality.
<ABS> Overall, we rated the quality of the evidence as moderate.
<ABS> The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment and future research should consider examining dose.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The majority of people with epilepsy have a good prognosis and their seizures are controlled by a single antiepileptic drug.
<INT> However, up to 20% of patients from population-based studies and up to 30% from clinical series (not population-based) develop drug-resistant epilepsy, especially those with partial onset seizures.
<INT> In this review we summarise the current evidence regarding topiramate, an antiepileptic drug first marketed in 1996, when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<INT> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 1999.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5); MEDLINE (1946 to 2013); SCOPUS (1823 to 2013); ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP.
<MaM> We imposed no language restrictions.
<MaM> We also contacted the manufacturers of topiramate and researchers in the field to identify any ongoing or unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data.
<MaM> We assessed the following outcomes: (a) 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; (b) seizure freedom; (c) treatment withdrawal (any reason); (d) side effects.
<MaM> Primary analyses were intention-to-treat and summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are presented.
<MaM> We evaluated dose response in regression models.
<MaM> We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach, which we presented in a 'Summary of findings' table.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials were included, representing 1401 randomised participants.
<RES> Baseline phases ranged from 4 to 12 weeks and double-blind phases from 11 to 19 weeks.
<RES> The RR for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo was 2.97 (95% CI 2.38 to 3.72).
<RES> Dose regression analysis shows increasing effect with increasing dose, but found no advantage for doses over 300 or 400 mg per day.
<RES> The RR for seizure freedom (95% CI) compared to placebo was 3.41 (95% CI 1.37 to 8.51).
<RES> The RR for treatment withdrawal compared to placebo was 2.44 (95% CI 1.64 to 3.62).
<RES> The RRs for the following side effects indicate that they are significantly associated with topiramate: ataxia 2.29 (99% CI 1.10 to 4.77); concentration difficulties 7.81 (2.08 to 29.29); dizziness 1.54 (99% CI 1.07 to 2.22); fatigue 2.19 (99% CI 1.42 to 3.40); paraesthesia 3.91 (1.51 to 10.12); somnolence 2.29 (99% CI 1.49 to 3.51); 'thinking abnormally' 5.70 (99% CI 2.26 to 14.38) and weight loss 3.47 (1.55 to 7.79).
<RES> Evidence of publication bias was found (P-value from the Egger test was P=0.003).
<RES> We rated all studies included in the review as having either low or unclear risk of bias.
<RES> Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate quality due to the evidence of publication bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Topiramate has efficacy as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant partial epilepsy in that it is three times more effective compared to a placebo in reducing seizures.
<CON> However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provide no evidence for the long-term efficacy of topiramate.
<CON> In the short term topiramate as an add-on has been shown to be associated with several adverse events.
<CON> The results of this review cannot be extrapolated to monotherapy or treatment of other epilepsy types and future research should consider examining the effect of dose.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing otitis media

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of vaccination against pneumococcus (a type of bacterium) on preventing middle ear infections in children.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Middle ear infection, or otitis media, is one of the most common respiratory infections in childhood.
<ABS> Vaccination against pneumococcus with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) is primarily introduced to protect young children against severe pneumococcal infections, such as meningitis and pneumonia.
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether vaccination with PCV also leads to fewer middle ear infections in children.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review included evidence up to 3 December 2013.
<ABS> Nine trials with a total of 48,426 children were included; five trials included 47,108 infants, while four trials included 1318 children at a later age, i.e. aged one to seven years, who were either healthy (one trial, 264 children) or had previous upper respiratory tract infections, including middle ear infections.
<ABS> All trials had a long follow-up, varying from 6 to 40 months.
<ABS> Key outcomes
<ABS> When vaccinating against seven different serotypes of pneumococcus (7-valent PCV) during early infancy, the occurrence of middle ear infections either increased by 5% or decreased by 6% to 7%.
<ABS> One study in infants used 11 serotypes of pneumococcus together with a carrier protein from another bacterium (Haemophilus influenzae); this decreased the occurrence of middle ear infections by 34%.
<ABS> Children with a history of middle ear infections do not seem to benefit from 7-valent PCV when immunised at an older age (after infancy).
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of the evidence for 7-valent PCV in early infancy to be high (further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect), while we judged the quality of the evidence for multivalent (more than seven different serotypes) PCV to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate), as this evidence is derived from only one trial.
<ABS> We judged the quality of the evidence for 7-valent PCV in older children with a history of middle ear infections to be high.
<ABS> Future studies on the effects of PCV in infants, with broader serotype coverage (more than seven different serotypes), are likely to provide more understanding of the role of PCV in preventing middle ear infections.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute otitis media (AOM) is a very common respiratory infection in early infancy and childhood.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 11 publications of nine RCTs (n = 48,426 children, range 74 to 37,868 per study) of 7- to 11-valent PCV (with different carrier proteins).
<RES> Five trials (n = 47,108) included infants, while four trials (n = 1318) included children aged one to seven years that were either healthy (one study, n = 264) or had a previous history of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), including AOM.
<RES> We judged the methodological quality of the included studies to be moderate to high.
<RES> There was considerable clinical diversity between studies in terms of study population, type of conjugate vaccine and outcome measures.
<RES> We therefore refrained from pooling the results.
<RES> In three studies, the 7-valent PCV with CRM197 as carrier protein (CRM197-PCV7) administered during early infancy was associated with a relative risk reduction (RRR) of all-cause AOM ranging from -5% in high-risk children (95% confidence interval (CI) -25% to 12%) to 7% in low-risk children (95% CI 4% to 9%).
<RES> Another 7-valent PCV with the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) serogroup B as carrier protein, administered in infancy, did not reduce overall AOM episodes, while a precursor 11-valent PCV with Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) protein D as carrier protein was associated with a RRR of all-cause AOM episodes of 34% (95% CI 21% to 44%).
<RES> A 9-valent PCV (with CRM197 carrier protein) administered in healthy toddlers was associated with a RRR of (parent-reported) OM episodes of 17% (95% CI -2% to 33%).
<RES> CRM197-PCV7 followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination administered after infancy in older children with a history of AOM showed no beneficial effect on first occurrence and later AOM episodes.
<RES> In a study in older children with a previously diagnosed respiratory tract infection, performed during the influenza season, a trivalent influenza vaccine combined with placebo (TIV/placebo) led to fewer all-cause AOM episodes than vaccination with TIV and PCV7 (TIV/PCV7) when compared to hepatitis B vaccination and placebo (HBV/placebo) (RRR 71%, 95% CI 30% to 88% versus RRR 57%, 95% CI 6% to 80%, respectively) indicating that CRM197-PCV7 after infancy may even have negative effects on AOM.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Based on current evidence of the effects of PCVs for preventing AOM, the licensed 7-valent CRM197-PCV7 has modest beneficial effects in healthy infants with a low baseline risk of AOM.
<CON> Administering PCV7 in high-risk infants, after early infancy and in older children with a history of AOM, appears to have no benefit in preventing further episodes.
<CON> Currently, several RCTs with different (newly licensed, multivalent) PCVs administered during early infancy are ongoing to establish their effects on AOM.
<CON> Results of these studies may provide a better understanding of the role of the newly licensed, multivalent PCVs in preventing AOM.
<CON> Also the impact on AOM of the carrier protein D, as used in certain pneumococcal vaccines, needs to be further established.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: This review compared intrauterine insemination versus fallopian tube sperm perfusion in the treatment of non-tubal subfertility, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes.
<ABS> Background: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is an assisted reproduction procedure that places sperm directly into the uterus.
<ABS> Fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP) is a similar procedure that places sperm into the woman's fallopian tube, closer to the eggs than IUI.
<ABS> Both techniques aim to improve the chance of conception.
<ABS> Study characteristics: The review included 16 randomised controlled trials (more than 1800 women) that compared these procedures for treating couples with non-tubal subfertility.
<ABS> Only three trials reported live birth.
<ABS> The evidence is current to September 2013.
<ABS> No trial reported its funding source, but one reported no conflict of interest, and one stated that it had received no commercial funding.
<ABS> Key results: No clear evidence suggests any difference between IUI and FSP with respect to their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of couples with non-tubal subfertility.
<ABS> However, a high level of uncertainty due to lack of data is evident in the findings.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low for most outcomes, largely because of the small quantity of available data.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment for couples with subfertility that does not involve the fallopian tubes.
<INT> It is used to bring the sperm close to the released oocyte.
<INT> Another method of introducing sperm is fallopian tube sperm perfusion (FSP).
<INT> Fallopian tube sperm perfusion ensures the presence of higher sperm densities in the fallopian tubes at the time of ovulation than does standard IUI.
<INT> These treatments are often used in combination with ovarian hyperstimulation.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched study reference lists and trial registers.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed study quality and extracted the data.
<MaM> If studies were sufficiently similar, data were combined using a fixed-effect model to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> A random-effects model was used if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected.
<MaM> Studies that included participants with unexplained or mixed (non-tubal) subfertility were analysed separately from studies restricted to participants with mild or moderate male factor subfertility.
<MaM> The overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes was summarised using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review included 16 RCTs.
<RES> Fourteen RCTs (1745 women) were included in the meta-analysis.
<RES> Only three studies reported live birth per couple.
<RES> No evidence of a statistically significant difference was noted between IUI and FSP in live birth (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.49, three RCTs, 633 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12, 14 RCTs, 1745 women, I2 = 52%, low-quality evidence).
<RES> These findings suggest that for a couple with a 13% chance of live birth using FSP, the chance when using IUI will be between 8% and 19%; and that for a couple with a 19% chance of pregnancy using FSP, the chance of pregnancy when using IUI will be between 10% and 20%.
<RES> Nor was evidence found of a statistically significant difference between IUI and FSP in per-pregnancy of multiple pregnancy (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07, eight RCTs, 197 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence), miscarriage (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.53, seven RCTs, 199 women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence) or ectopic pregnancy (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 6.88, four RCTs, 111 women, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Substantial heterogeneity was noted for the outcome of clinical pregnancy (I2 = 54%), for which no clear explanation was provided.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, a high level of uncertainty is evident in the findings, and additional research may be useful.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in a leg, forming a deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which may cause pain and swelling.
<ABS> This is very rarely fatal, but if part of the clot breaks off it may be carried to the lungs by the blood and block vessels there (this is called a pulmonary embolism (PE)), which can result in death.
<ABS> Normally occurring changes to the clotting system during pregnancy can increase the risk of a thromboembolic event (DVT or PE), and some groups of women have a higher risk of developing VTE (including older and obese women; women with previous VTE; women with thrombophilia (a condition predisposing individuals to developing clots); and women following a caesarean birth).
<ABS> Preventive treatments include drugs to prevent clots, support stockings, and physical activity soon after birth to keep the circulation moving.
<ABS> However, some drugs might cause problems such as increased blood loss after birth.
<ABS> Drugs used include unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin and aspirin.
<ABS> We included 19 randomised controlled trials in this review but only 16 trials with 2592 women could be included in the analysis.
<ABS> The trials were of a moderate quality, and assessed drugs including unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy and after caesarean birth.
<ABS> We found no evidence to suggest that using heparin in pregnancy or after a caesarean birth reduces the risk of maternal death, DVT or PE, and no differences were shown for these outcomes when different types of heparin were compared.
<ABS> Women who received low molecular weight heparin seemed to be less likely to have bleeding episodes (bruises of more than 1 inch; injection site haematoma (a localised collection of blood outside blood vessels) of at least 2 cm in diameter, bleeding at birth and other bleeding), were less likely to have injection site burning, excess bruising and allergic rashes, and less likely to have a fetal loss, than women who received unfractionated heparin; however, the trials that showed these results were not of high quality.
<ABS> We did not find enough evidence from the trials to be sure about the effects of these preventive treatments.
<ABS> This means there is not enough evidence to show which are the best ways to prevent VTE (including DVT and PE), during or following pregnancy, including after a caesarean birth.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Venous thromboembolism (VTE), although rare, is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and methods of prophylaxis are therefore often used for women considered to be at risk.
<INT> Many methods of prophylaxis carry risks of adverse effects, and as the risk of VTE is often low, it is possible that the benefits of thromboprophylaxis may be outweighed by harms.
<INT> Guidelines for clinical practice have been based on expert opinion rather than high-quality evidence from randomised trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen trials, at an overall moderate risk of bias, met the inclusion criteria for the review.
<RES> Only 16 trials, involving 2592 women, assessing a range of methods of thromboprophylaxis, contributed data to the review.
<RES> Six trials compared methods of antenatal prophylaxis: heparin versus no treatment/placebo (two trials), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) (four trials).
<RES> Nine trials assessed prophylaxis after caesarean section: four compared heparin with placebo; three compared LMWH with UFH; one compared hydroxyethyl starch (HES) with UFH; and one compared five-day versus 10-day LMWH.
<RES> One study examined prophylaxis with UFH in the postnatal period (including following vaginal births).
<RES> For antenatal prophylaxis, none of the included trials reported on maternal mortality, and no differences were detected for the other primary outcomes of symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT) when LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo or when LMWH was compared with UFH.
<RES> The risk ratios (RR) for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: antenatal LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 2.99 (two trials, 56 women); and antenatal LMWH versus UFH, RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.09 to 2.49 (four trials, 404 women).
<RES> No differences were shown when antenatal LMWH or UFH was compared with no treatment/placebo for any secondary outcomes.
<RES> Antenatal LMWH was associated with fewer adverse effects sufficient to stop treatment (RR 0.07; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54; two trials, 226 women), and fewer fetal losses (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; three trials, 343 women) when compared with UFH.
<RES> In two trials, antenatal LMWH compared with UFH was associated with fewer bleeding episodes (defined in one trial of 121 women as bruises > 1 inch (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.36); and in one trial of 105 women as injection site haematomas of ≥ 2 cm, bleeding during delivery or other bleeding (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53)), however in a further trial of 117 women no difference between groups was shown for bleeding at delivery.
<RES> The results for these secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution, being derived from small trials that were not of high methodological quality.
<RES> For post-caesarean/postnatal prophylaxis, only one trial comparing five-day versus 10-day LMWH after caesarean section reported on maternal mortality, observing no deaths.
<RES> No differences were seen across any of the comparisons for the other primary outcomes (symptomatic thromboembolic events, symptomatic PE and symptomatic DVT).
<RES> The RRs for symptomatic thromboembolic events were: post-caesarean LMWH/UFH versus no heparin, RR 1.30; 95% CI 0.39 to 4.27 (four trials, 840 women); post-caesarean LMWH versus UFH, RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99 (three trials, 217 women); post-caesarean five-day versus 10-day LMWH, RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.78 (one trial, 646 women); postnatal UFH versus no heparin, RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.02 to 1.36 (one trial, 210 women).
<RES> For prophylaxis after caesarean section, in one trial (of 580 women), women receiving UFH and physiotherapy were more likely to have bleeding complications ('complications hémorragiques') than women receiving physiotherapy alone (RR 5.03; 95% CI 2.49 to 10.18).
<RES> In two additional trials, that compared LMWH with placebo, no difference between groups in bleeding episodes (major bleeding; major bruising; bleeding/bruising reported at discharge) were detected.
<RES> No other differences in secondary outcomes were shown when LMWH was compared with UFH post-caesarean, nor when post-caesarean HES was compared with UFH, post-caesarean five-day LMWH was compared with 10-day LMWH, or when UFH was compared to no heparin postnatally.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Large scale, high-quality randomised trials of currently used interventions are warranted.

<H1> Vaccines for preventing influenza in people with cystic fibrosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Vaccines for preventing influenza in people with cystic fibrosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with cystic fibrosis have blocked airways which results in frequent airway infections.
<ABS> Infections with viral diseases like influenza ("the flu") can worsen lung damage.
<ABS> Doctors therefore often advise people with cystic fibrosis to be vaccinated against influenza every year.
<ABS> We searched for studies which compared different vaccines or compared vaccination to placebo.
<ABS> We were able to include four studies with 179 people in the review.
<ABS> Most (143) were under 16 years old.
<ABS> No study compared one vaccine to placebo.
<ABS> Vaccination does result in an immune system response to the types of influenza used in the vaccine.
<ABS> However, this response may not result in protection against influenza infection or lung damage.
<ABS> There were a high number of adverse events, but none were serious or persistent.
<ABS> There is no evidence to show if regular influenza vaccine benefits people with cystic fibrosis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Viral respiratory tract infections in people with cystic fibrosis have a deteriorating effect on their lung function and disease progression.
<INT> Annual influenza vaccination is therefore commonly recommended for people with cystic fibrosis.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccination for people with cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also contacted the companies which market the influenza vaccines used in the trials to obtain further information about randomised controlled trials.
<MaM> Date of the most recent search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 08 July 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies enrolling a total of 179 participants with cystic fibrosis (143 (80%) were children aged 1 to 16 years) were included in this review.
<RES> There was no study comparing a vaccine to a placebo or a whole virus vaccine to a subunit or split virus vaccine.
<RES> Two studies compared an intranasal applied live vaccine to an intramuscular inactivated vaccine and the other two studies compared a split virus to a subunit vaccine and a virosome to a subunit vaccine (all intramuscular).
<RES> The incidence of all reported adverse events was high depending on the type of influenza vaccine.
<RES> The total adverse event rate ranged from 48 out of 201 participants (24%) for the intranasal live vaccine to 13 out of 30 participants (43%) for the split virus vaccine.
<RES> With the limitation of a statistical low power there was no significant difference between the study vaccinations.
<RES> None of the events were severe.
<RES> All study influenza vaccinations generated a satisfactory serological antibody response.
<RES> No study reported other clinically important benefits.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There remains a need for a well-constructed clinical study, that assesses the effectiveness of influenza vaccination on important clinical outcome measures.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We performed this review to assess the evidence from randomised trials on how effective and safe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is for people with CIDP.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an illness in which nerves become inflamed and this leads to paralysis.
<ABS> The likely cause is that the body attacks its own nerves.
<ABS> CIDP usually requires long-term treatment to prevent further disability.
<ABS> There is much debate about the first choice of treatment.
<ABS> One choice is a medicine called immunoglobulin, which is a product made from purified antibodies from human donor blood and which is given via injection into a vein.
<ABS> Steroid drugs and plasma exchange (a treatment in which the plasma element of a person's blood is replaced), are known to be effective.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Eight randomised controlled trials including 332 participants with CIDP were eligible for this review.
<ABS> These compared IVIg with placebo (dummy treatment), plasma exchange, or steroid drugs.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found five randomised trials which together prove that IVIg improves disability more than placebo (dummy treatment).
<ABS> The results showed that three people would need to be treated for one person to improve.
<ABS> In the three trials that compared IVIg with other treatments, results with IVIg were similar to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone or intravenous methylprednisolone.
<ABS> The evidence was of moderate or high quality.
<ABS> In this review, there were mild and short-term side effects in around half of those who received IVIg.
<ABS> Six per cent of those treated with IVIg had serious side effects, which is a similar rate as with plasma exchange or corticosteroids.
<ABS> Each trial defined improvement in its own way and the trials used different measurement scales, so it is difficult to relate them to changes in the clinical condition of people with CIDP.
<ABS> Only one of the studies that compared IVIg with placebo had a long-term follow-up.
<ABS> It suggested that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 weeks and possibly 48 weeks.
<ABS> Further research is needed to compare the long-term benefits as well as side effects of IVIg with other treatments.
<ABS> The most recent search for studies was in December 2012 and we updated the review with the results of one additional trial.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) causes progressive or relapsing weakness and numbness of the limbs, developing over at least two months.
<INT> Uncontrolled studies suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) helps.
<INT> This review was first published in 2002 and has since been updated, most recently in 2013.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 4 December 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, issue 11 in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE and EMBASE to December 2012 and ISI from January 1985 to May 2008.
<MaM> We searched for ongoing trials through two metaRegistries (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and Current Controlled Trials).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We contacted authors for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We considered eight RCTs, including 332 participants, to be eligible for inclusion in the review.
<RES> These trials were homogeneous and the overall risk of bias low.
<RES> Five studies, in a total of 235 participants compared IVIg against placebo.
<RES> One trial with 20 participants compared IVIg with plasma exchange, one trial compared IVIg with prednisolone in 32 participants, and one trial, newly included at this update, compared IVIg with intravenous methylprednisolone in 46 participants.
<RES> A significantly higher proportion of participants improved in disability within one month after IVIg treatment as compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 3.36; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 3.03 (95% CI 2.33 to 4.55), high quality evidence).
<RES> Whether all these improvements are equally clinically relevant cannot be deduced from this analysis because each trial used different disability scales and definitions of significant improvement.
<RES> In three trials, including 84 participants, the disability score could be transformed to the modified Rankin score, on which improvement of one point after IVIg treatment compared to placebo was barely significant (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.83) (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Only one placebo-controlled study included in this review had a long-term follow-up.
<RES> The results of this study suggest that IVIg improves disability more than placebo over 24 and 48 weeks.
<RES> The mean disability score revealed no significant difference between IVIg and plasma exchange at six weeks (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There was no significant difference in improvement in disability on prednisolone compared with IVIg after two or six weeks, or on methylprednisolone compared to IVIg after two weeks or six months (moderate quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence from RCTs shows that IVIg improves disability for at least two to six weeks compared with placebo, with an NNTB of three.
<CON> During this period it has similar efficacy to plasma exchange, oral prednisolone and intravenous methylprednisolone.
<CON> In one large trial, the benefit of IVIg persisted for 24 and possibly 48 weeks.
<CON> Further research is needed to compare the long-term benefits as well as side effects of IVIg with other treatments.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Venous leg ulcers (open sores) can be caused by a blockage or breakdown in the veins of the leg.
<ABS> Compression, using bandages or hosiery (stockings), can help heal ulcers.
<ABS> However, they do not always work, and some people are not willing or able to wear them.
<ABS> Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) uses an air pump to inflate and deflate an airtight bag wrapped around the leg.
<ABS> This technique is also used to stop blood clots developing during surgery.
<ABS> However, the review of trials found conflicting evidence about whether or not IPC is better than compression bandages and hosiery.
<ABS> Some studies suggest IPC might be a beneficial addition to bandages for some ulcers, but these studies might be biased.
<ABS> Delivering the IPC therapy in a rapid manner by inflating and deflating the IPC device more quickly resulted in more ulcers being healed than with a slower deflation regime.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether IPC increases the healing of venous leg ulcers.
<OBJ> To determine the effects of IPC on health related quality of life of venous leg ulcer patients.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One review author extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias and this was checked by a second review author.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified nine randomised controlled trials (including 489 people in total).
<RES> Only one trial was at low risk of bias overall having reported adequate randomisation, allocation concealment and blinded outcome assessment.
<RES> In one trial (80 people) more ulcers healed with IPC than with dressings (62% vs 28%; p=0.002).
<RES> Five trials compared IPC plus compression with compression alone.
<RES> Two of these (97 people) found increased ulcer healing with IPC plus compression than with compression alone.
<RES> The remaining three trials (122 people) found no evidence of a benefit for IPC plus compression compared with compression alone.
<RES> Two trials (86 people) found no difference between IPC (without additional compression) and compression bandages alone.
<RES> One trial (104 people) compared different ways of delivering IPC and found that rapid IPC healed more ulcers than slow IPC (86% vs 61%).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> IPC may increase healing compared with no compression.
<CON> It is unclear whether it can be used instead of compression bandages.
<CON> There is some limited evidence that IPC may improve healing when added to compression bandages.
<CON> Rapid IPC was better than slow IPC in one trial.
<CON> Further trials are required to determine the reliability of current evidence, which patients may benefit from IPC in addition to compression bandages, and the optimum treatment regimen.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Epilepsy is a disorder in which recurrent seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges from the brain.
<ABS> Most seizures can be controlled by a single antiepileptic drug (AED); this approach is known as monotherapy.
<ABS> Unfortunately, some people require more than one antiepileptic drug to control their seizures, especially if these originate from one area of the brain (partial epilepsy), instead of being generalised.
<ABS> Tiagabine is a newer antiepileptic drug that has been used as an additional AED to monotherapy.
<ABS> This review looks at the evidence about how effective tiagabine is in reducing seizures, as well as the side effects that may be associated with its use.
<ABS> A search of databases was carried out on 11 November 2013.
<ABS> Six trials were found that included 900 people with partial epilepsy.
<ABS> These trials were all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the antiepileptic drug topiramate versus a placebo drug or a different AED for a period of up to 24 weeks.
<ABS> By taking all evidence from the trials into account, the review found that tiagabine is effective when used with other drugs to reduce the number of seizures in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<ABS> However, adding tiagabine to the usual treatment is associated with an increase in side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, nervousness and tremor.
<ABS> Trials were assessed with regards to bias and quality, and overall, the quality of evidence for the outcome of seizure reduction was rated as high.
<ABS> The trials included in this review did not examine the long-term effects of topiramate as an add-on treatment.
<ABS> Future research is needed to determine how this drug performs in comparison with other newer antiepileptic drugs.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is a common neurological condition that affects almost 0.5% to 1% of the population.
<INT> Nearly 30% of people with epilepsy are resistant to currently available drugs.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2012 (Issue 5).
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (November 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 10) and MEDLINE (1946 to November 2013).
<MaM> No language restrictions were imposed.
<MaM> We also contacted the manufacturers of tiagabine and experts in the field to seek any ongoing or unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The studies could be double-blind, single-blind or unblinded and of parallel or cross-over design.
<MaM> They had to have a minimum treatment period of eight weeks.
<MaM> Trials using an active drug control group were also included.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved by discussion.
<MaM> Outcomes investigated included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, treatment withdrawal, adverse effects, effects on cognition and quality of life.
<MaM> The primary analyses were performed by intention-to-treat.
<MaM> Dose response was evaluated in regression models.
<MaM> Risk of bias in each study was assessed by two review authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four parallel-group and two cross-over group trials were included.
<RES> The overall risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (tiagabine vs placebo) was 3.16 (95% CI 1.97 to 5.07).
<RES> Because of differences in response rates among trials, regression models were unable to provide reliable estimates of response to individual doses.
<RES> The RR for treatment withdrawal was 1.81 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.62).
<RES> The 99% CIs for the adverse effects of dizziness, fatigue, nervousness and tremor did not include unity, indicating that they are significantly associated with tiagabine.
<RES> For cognitive and quality of life outcomes, the limited available data suggested no significant effects on cognition and mood and adjustment.
<RES> Two of the five studies were judged as having low risk of bias, three studies unclear risk of bias and one study high risk of bias.
<RES> Overall study quality was rated as high using the GRADE approach.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an inherited disorder characterised by a raised blood cholesterol, and premature ischaemic heart disease.
<ABS> Changing diet is an important management option to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) levels.
<ABS> Recently, certain lipid-lowering drugs have shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of children with familial hypercholesterolaemia.
<ABS> However, dietary management remains important either on its own or combined with drug therapy.
<ABS> Several strategies are used to modify diet.
<ABS> This review aimed to compare cholesterol-lowering dietary interventions either in combination with each other or alone.
<ABS> These interventions included adding omega-3 fatty acids or plant sterols or plant stanols or soya proteins to diet.
<ABS> Fifteen trials were included in this updated review.
<ABS> The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the domains used for risk assessment.
<ABS> All the trials were short term and the majority were cross-over in design.
<ABS> For most of the comparisons there was no significant difference in the various intervention strategies when compared to cholesterol-lowering diet.
<ABS> However, for total cholesterol levels, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, a significant benefit was obtained with plant sterols.
<ABS> However, before drawing any conclusions, methodological problems with pooling results from cross-over trials should be considered.
<ABS> There is a need for long-term trials with parallel group design to assess the potential benefits and harms of a cholesterol-lowering diet.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A cholesterol-lowering diet and several other dietary interventions have been suggested as a management approach either independently or as an adjuvant to drug therapy in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).
<INT> However, a consensus has yet to be reached on the most appropriate dietary treatment.
<INT> Plant sterols are commonly used in FH although patients may know them by other names like phytosterols or stanols.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Further, to compare the efficacy of supplementing a cholesterol-lowering diet with either omega-3 fatty acids, soya proteins, plant sterols or plant stanols.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 22 August 2013.
<MaM> We also searched PubMed to 05 February 2012.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In the 2014 update of the review, 15 trials have been included, with a total of 453 participants across seven comparison groups.
<RES> The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the parameters used for risk assessment.
<RES> Only short-term outcomes could be assessed due to the short duration of follow up in the included trials.
<RES> None of the primary outcomes, (incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death) were evaluated in any of the included trials.
<RES> No significant differences were noted for the majority of secondary outcomes for any of the planned comparisons.
<RES> However, a significant difference was found for the following comparisons and outcomes: for the comparison between plant sterols and cholesterol-lowering diet (in favour of plant sterols), total cholesterol levels, mean difference 0.30 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48); decreased serum LDL cholesterol, mean difference -0.60 mmol/l (95% CI -0.89 to -0.31).
<RES> Fasting serum HDL cholesterol levels were elevated, mean difference -0.04 mmol/l (95% CI -0.11 to 0.03) and serum triglyceride concentration was reduced, mean difference -0.03 mmol/l (95% CI -0.15 to -0.09), although these changes were not statistically significant.
<RES> Similarly, guar gum when given as an add on therapy to bezafibrate reduced total cholesterol and LDL levels as compared to bezafibrate alone.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Large, parallel, randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols or stanols, soya protein, dietary fibers to a cholesterol-lowering diet.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question
<ABS> We wanted to know whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Stroke can cause paralysis of some parts of the body and other difficulties with various physical functions.
<ABS> Physical rehabilitation is an important part of rehabilitation for people who have had a stroke.
<ABS> Over the years, various approaches to physical rehabilitation have been developed, according to different ideas about how people recover after a stroke.
<ABS> Often physiotherapists will follow one particular approach, to the exclusion of others, but this practice is generally based on personal preference rather than scientific rationale.
<ABS> Considerable debate continues among physiotherapists about the relative benefits of different approaches; therefore it is important to bring together the research evidence and highlight what best practice ought to be in selecting these different approaches.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 96 studies, up to December 2012, for inclusion in the review.
<ABS> These studies, involving 10,401 stroke survivors, investigated physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke compared with no treatment, usual care or attention control or in comparisons of different physical rehabilitation approaches.
<ABS> The average number of participants in each study was 105: most studies (93%) included fewer than 200 participants, one study had more than 1000 participants, six had between 250 and 100 participants and 10 had 20 or fewer participants.
<ABS> Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function (functional movement), balance, walking speed and length of stay.
<ABS> More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China.
<ABS> These studies showed many differences in relation to the type of stroke and how severe it was, as well as differences in treatment, which varied according to both treatment type and duration.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> This review brings together evidence confirming that physical rehabilitation (often delivered by a physiotherapist, physical therapist or rehabilitation therapist) can improve function, balance and walking after stroke.
<ABS> It appears to be most beneficial when the therapist selects a mixture of different treatments for an individual patient from a wide range of available treatments.
<ABS> We were able to combine the results from 27 studies (3243 stroke survivors) that compared physical rehabilitation versus no treatment.
<ABS> Twenty-five of these 27 studies were carried out in China.
<ABS> Results showed that physical rehabilitation improves functional recovery, and that this improvement may last long-term.
<ABS> When we looked at studies that compared additional physical rehabilitation versus usual care or a control intervention, we found evidence to show that the additional physical treatment improved motor function (12 studies, 887 stroke survivors), standing balance (five studies, 246 stroke survivors) and walking speed (14 studies, 1126 stroke survivors).
<ABS> Very limited evidence suggests that, for comparisons of physical rehabilitation versus no treatment and versus usual care, treatment that appeared to be effective was given between 30 and 60 minutes per day, five to seven days per week, but further research is needed to confirm this.
<ABS> We also found evidence of greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke, but again further research is needed to confirm this.
<ABS> We found evidence showing that no one physical rehabilitation approach was more effective than any other approach.
<ABS> This finding means that physiotherapists should choose each individual patient's treatment according to the evidence available for that specific treatment, and should not limit their practice to a single 'named' approach.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> It was difficult for us to judge the quality of evidence because we found poor, incomplete or brief reporting of information.
<ABS> We determined that less than 50% of the studies were of good quality, and for most studies, the quality of the evidence was unclear from the information provided.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Various approaches to physical rehabilitation may be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate surround the effectiveness of relative approaches.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether physical rehabilitation approaches are effective in recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach.
<OBJ> For the previous versions of this review, the objective was to explore the effect of 'physiotherapy treatment approaches' based on historical classifications of orthopaedic, neurophysiological or motor learning principles, or on a mixture of these treatment principles.
<OBJ> In addition, we sought to explore the impact of time after stroke, geographical location of the study, dose of the intervention, provider of the intervention and treatment components included within an intervention.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke.
<MaM> Outcomes included measures of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), motor function, balance, gait velocity and length of stay.
<MaM> We included trials comparing physical rehabilitation approaches versus no treatment, usual care or attention control and those comparing different physical rehabilitation approaches.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included a total of 96 studies (10,401 participants) in this review.
<RES> More than half of the studies (50/96) were carried out in China.
<RES> Generally the studies were heterogeneous, and many were poorly reported.
<RES> Physical rehabilitation was found to have a beneficial effect, as compared with no treatment, on functional recovery after stroke (27 studies, 3423 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.97, for Independence in ADL scales), and this effect was noted to persist beyond the length of the intervention period (nine studies, 540 participants; SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.04).
<RES> Subgroup analysis revealed a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value < 0.0001, for independence in ADL), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week is effective.
<RES> This evidence principally arises from studies carried out in China.
<RES> Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.003, for independence in ADL).
<RES> We found physical rehabilitation to be more effective than usual care or attention control in improving motor function (12 studies, 887 participants; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), balance (five studies, 246 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.56) and gait velocity (14 studies, 1126 participants; SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60).
<RES> Subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant difference based on dose of intervention (P value 0.02 for motor function), indicating that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes delivered five to seven days a week provides significant benefit.
<RES> Subgroup analyses also suggest significant benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke (P value 0.05, for independence in ADL).
<RES> No one physical rehabilitation approach was more (or less) effective than any other approach in improving independence in ADL (eight studies, 491 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.71) or motor function (nine studies, 546 participants; test for subgroup differences: P value 0.41).
<RES> These findings are supported by subgroup analyses carried out for comparisons of intervention versus no treatment or usual care, which identified no significant effects of different treatment components or categories of interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Physical rehabilitation, comprising a selection of components from different approaches, is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke.
<CON> Evidence related to dose of physical therapy is limited by substantial heterogeneity and does not support robust conclusions.
<CON> No one approach to physical rehabilitation is any more (or less) effective in promoting recovery of function and mobility after stroke.
<CON> Therefore, evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation should not be limited to compartmentalised, named approaches, but rather should comprise clearly defined, well-described, evidenced-based physical treatments, regardless of historical or philosophical origin.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia have ‘positive symptoms’ such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations) and fixed strange beliefs (delusions).
<ABS> People with schizophrenia also have ‘negative symptoms’ such as tiredness, apathy and loss of emotion.
<ABS> Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia and can be grouped into older drugs (first generation or ‘typical’) and newer drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’).
<ABS> Pimozide is a ‘typical’ antipsychotic drug that was first introduced in the late 1960s and was given to people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> Pimozide is thought to be effective in treating the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia or similar mental health problems such as delusional disorder, but it produces serious side effects such as muscle stiffness, tremors and slow body movements.
<ABS> Pimozide may also cause heart problems and has been linked to sudden unexplained death.
<ABS> Monitoring the heart via electrocardiogram is now required before and during treatment with pimozide.
<ABS> Pimozide was compared with other antipsychotic drugs, placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) or no treatment.
<ABS> Results suggest that pimozide is probably just as effective as other commonly used ‘typical’ antipsychotic drugs (for outcomes such as treating mental state, relapse, leaving the study early).
<ABS> No studies included delusional disorders, so no information is available on this group of people.
<ABS> No evidence was found to support the concern that pimozide causes heart problems (although this may be result of the fact that the studies were small and short term and the participants did not receive doses above recommended limits of 20 mg/d).
<ABS> Pimozide may cause less sleepiness than other typical antipsychotic drugs, but it may cause more tremors and uncontrollable shaking.
<ABS> The claim that pimozide is useful for treating people with negative symptoms also is not supported and proven.
<ABS> However, the quality of evidence in the main was low or very low quality, studies were small and of short duration and were poorly reported.
<ABS> Large-scale, well-conducted and well-reported studies are required to assess the effectiveness of pimozide in the treatment of schizophrenia and other mental health problems such as delusional disorder.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Benjamin Gray (Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Electrocardiogram monitoring is now required before and during use.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> A secondary objective was to examine the effects of pimozide for people with delusional disorder.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Working independently, we inspected citations, ordered papers and then re-inspected and assessed the quality of the studies and of extracted data.
<MaM> For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the relative risk (RR), the 95% confidence interval (CI) and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data.
<MaM> We excluded data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50%.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to rate the quality of the evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 32 studies in total: Among the five studies that compared pimozide versus placebo, only one study provided data for global state relapse, for which no difference between groups was noted at medium term (1 RCT n = 20, RR 0.22 CI 0.03 to 1.78, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> None of the five studies provided data for no improvement or first-rank symptoms in mental state.
<RES> Data for extrapyramidal symptoms demonstrate no difference between groups for Parkinsonism (rigidity) at short term (1 RCT, n = 19, RR 5.50 CI 0.30 to 101.28, very low quality of evidence) or at medium term (1 RCT n = 25, RR 1.33 CI 0.14 to 12.82, very low quality of evidence), or for Parkinsonism (tremor) at medium term (1 RCT n = 25, RR 1 CI 0.2 to 4.95, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> No data were reported for quality of life at medium term.
<RES> Of the 26 studies comparing pimozide versus any antipsychotic, seven studies provided data for global state relapse at medium term, for which no difference was noted (7 RCTs n = 227, RR 0.82 CI 0.57 to 1.17, moderate quality of evidence).
<RES> Data from one study demonstrated no difference in mental state (no improvement) at medium term (1 RCT n = 23, RR 1.09 CI 0.08 to 15.41, very low quality evidence); another study demonstrated no difference in the presence of first-rank symptoms at medium term (1 RCT n = 44, RR 0.53 CI 0.25 to 1.11, low quality of evidence).
<RES> Data for extrapyramidal symptoms demonstrate no difference between groups for Parkinsonism (rigidity) at short term (6 RCTs n = 186, RR 1.21 CI 0.71 to 2.05, low quality of evidence) or medium term (5 RCTs n = 219, RR 1.12 CI 0.24 to 5.25, low quality of evidence), or for Parkinsonism (tremor) at medium term (4 RCTs n = 174, RR 1.46 CI 0.68 to 3.11, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> No data were reported for quality of life at medium term.
<RES> In the one study that compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus the same antipsychotic, significantly fewer relapses were noted in the augmented pimozide group at medium term (1 RCT n = 69, RR 0.28 CI 0.15 to 0.50, low quality evidence).
<RES> No data were reported for mental state outcomes or for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).
<RES> Data were skewed for quality of life scores, which were not included in the meta-analysis but were presented separately.
<RES> Two studies compared pimozide plus any antipsychotics versus antipsychotic plus placebo; neither study reported data for outcomes of interest, apart from Parkinsonism at medium term and quality of life using the Specific Level of Functioning scale (SLOF); however, data were skewed.
<RES> Only one study compared pimozide plus any antipsychotic versus antipsychotics plus antipsychotic; no data were reported for global state and mental state outcomes of interest.
<RES> Data were provided for Parkinsonism (rigidity and tremor) using the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS); however, these data were skewed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> SmalI cell lung cancer accounts for nearly a quarter of all new cases of lung cancer.
<ABS> This cancer is often diagnosed in an advanced stage, which means that it has spread to the brain, liver, bone or bone marrow, and most patients die in the first year after diagnosis.
<ABS> This review found that first-line chemotherapy (anticancer drugs) may prolong the survival of patients with advanced small cell lung cancer for some months when compared to supportive care, although the effect of this treatment on quality of life is unknown.
<ABS> The benefit of a new treatment (second-line chemotherapy) when the disease has progressed or relapsed was even smaller, and the potential survival gain of some weeks must be balanced against its possible secondary effects.
<ABS> Since the available studies were scarce and of variable quality, more clinical trials are needed to assess and better inform patients about the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in advanced small cell lung cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The main goal for these patients should be palliation with the aim of improving their quality of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> This is the second update of the review.
<MaM> MEDLINE (1966 to October 2013), EMBASE (1974 to October 2013), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 3) were searched.
<MaM> Experts in the field were contacted.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements by discussion.
<MaM> Additional information was obtained from one study author.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies of unclear risk of bias were included for first-line chemotherapy.
<RES> A total of 88 men under 70 years with good performance status were randomised to receive either supportive care, placebo infusion or ifosfamide.
<RES> Ifosfamide gave an extra mean survival of 78.5 days compared with supportive care or placebo infusion.
<RES> Partial tumour response was greater with the active treatment.
<RES> Toxicity was only seen in the chemotherapy group and quality of life was only assessed at the beginning of treatment.
<RES> The quality of the evidence for overall survival and adverse effects was very low.
<RES> Three studies of moderate risk of bias were included for second-line chemotherapy at relapse (one identified in the last search).
<RES> A total of 932 men and women under 75 years and any performance status were randomised to receive either methotrexate-doxorubicin, topotecan, or picoplatin versus symptomatic treatment or BSC.
<RES> The methotrexate-doxorubicin treatment gave a median survival of 63 days longer than in the symptomatic-treatment group for patients allocated to receive four cycles of first-line chemotherapy, and 21 days longer for patients allocated to receive eight cycles of first-line chemotherapy.
<RES> Treatment with topotecan gave a median survival of 84 days longer than in the BSC group (log-rank P = 0.01).
<RES> The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival was 0.61 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.87).
<RES> Treatment with picoplatin gave a median survival time of six days longer than BSC (HR 0.817, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.0895).
<RES> A meta-analysis of topotecan and picoplatin gave a HR of 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96, P = 0.03; low-quality evidence).
<RES> Partial or complete response in the methotrexate-doxorubicin group was 22.3%.
<RES> Five patients (7%, 95% CI 2.33 to 15.67) showed a partial response with topotecan.
<RES> No data were provided about tumour response in the picoplatin study.
<RES> Toxicity was worst in the chemotherapy group (moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Quality of life was better in the topotecan group and was not measured in the methotrexate-doxorubicin and picoplatin studies (low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Two small RCTs from the 1970s suggest that first-line chemotherapeutic treatment (based on ifosfamide) may provide a small survival benefit (less than three months) in comparison with supportive care or placebo infusion in patients with advanced SCLC.
<CON> Second-line chemotherapy at relapse or progression may prolong survival for some weeks in relation to BSC.
<CON> Nevertheless, the impact of first-line chemotherapy on quality of life, older patients, women and patients with poor prognosis is unknown and the benefits of second-line chemotherapy are also unclear for older people.
<CON> Globally, the evidence on which these conclusions are based is very scarce and of uncertain or low quality, which calls for well-designed, controlled trials to further evaluate the trade-offs between benefits and risks of different chemotherapeutic schedules in patients with advanced SCLC.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticoagulants for intermittent claudication

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries in which fatty deposits block the flow of blood.
<ABS> This can cause intermittent claudication, when cramping pain in the legs is brought on by exercise and relieved by rest.
<ABS> These fatty deposits can also cause serious blockages that lead to heart attacks and the need for amputation (surgical removal of the limb).
<ABS> Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin, are drugs that prevent clotting and may help people with intermittent claudication.
<ABS> No new studies were included for this update.
<ABS> Seven studies with 802 participants were included in this review.
<ABS> The review of trials found that the benefit of heparin, LMWHs and oral anticoagulants for treatment of intermittent claudication has not been established while an increased risk of major bleeding events has been observed, especially with oral anticoagulants.
<ABS> There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage.
<ABS> More research is needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of the review first published in 2001.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Seven studies were included.
<MaM> Four other studies were included in the sensitivity analysis.
<MaM> The authors extracted the data independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No new studies were included for this update.
<RES> Seven studies with a combined total of 802 participants were included in this review.
<RES> No significant difference was observed between heparin treatment and control groups for pain-free walking distance or maximum walking distance at the end of treatment.
<RES> There were no data to indicate that LMWHs benefit walking distance.
<RES> Revascularisation or amputation-free survival rates were reported in one study only with a five year follow-up.
<RES> No study reported a significant effect on overall mortality or cardiovascular events and the pooled odds ratios were not significant for these outcomes either.
<RES> Major and minor bleeding events were significantly more frequent in the group treated with oral anticoagulants compared to control, with a non-significant increase in fatal bleeding events.
<RES> No major bleeding events were reported in the study evaluating heparin, while a non-significant increase in minor bleeding events was reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no clear evidence to support the use of anticoagulants for intermittent claudication at this stage.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disease that affects cells in the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others).
<ABS> People with cystic fibrosis have a greater risk of chronic lung infections.
<ABS> They receive antibiotics by injection to treat these.
<ABS> The antibiotics are either a single drug or a combination of drugs.
<ABS> Both the choice of antibiotic and the use of single or combined therapy vary.
<ABS> We looked for randomised controlled trials which compared a single intravenous antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus one other in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> We included eight trials with a total of 356 people.
<ABS> Six of these were published before 1988.
<ABS> A range of drugs was used in the trials.
<ABS> We did not find any differences between the two therapies for lung function, symptom scores, adverse effects or bacteriological outcome measures.
<ABS> We conclude that there is not enough evidence to compare the different therapies.
<ABS> More research is needed, particularly for adverse effects.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 22 August 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 43 trials, of which eight trials (356 participants) comparing a single agent to a combination of the same antibiotic and one other, were included.
<RES> There was a wide variation in the individual antibiotics used in each trial.
<RES> In total, the trials included seven comparisons of a beta-lactam antibiotic (penicillin-related or third generation cephalosporin) with a beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination and three comparisons of an aminoglycoside with a beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination.
<RES> These two groups of trials were analysed as separate subgroups.
<RES> There was considerable heterogeneity amongst these trials, leading to difficulties in performing the review and interpreting the results.
<RES> The meta-analysis did not demonstrate any significant differences between monotherapy and combination therapy, in terms of lung function; symptom scores; adverse effects; and bacteriological outcome measures.
<RES> These results should be interpreted cautiously.
<RES> Six of the included trials were published between 1977 and 1988; these were single-centre trials with flaws in the randomisation process and small sample size.
<RES> Overall, the methodological quality was poor.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The results of this review are inconclusive.
<CON> The review raises important methodological issues.
<CON> Results need to be standardised to a consistent method of reporting, in order to validate the pooling of results from multiple trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis is a serious genetic disorder which affects the lungs and the exocrine glands (sweat glands and others).
<ABS> Most people with cystic fibrosis develop persistent lung infections and they may receive frequent courses of intravenous antibiotics.
<ABS> Giving the antibiotics once per day reduces the cost and the time involved, compared to giving several doses per day.
<ABS> This review includes four trials with a total of 328 people.
<ABS> All the trials compared once-a-day dosing with three times-a-day dosing.
<ABS> The review also found that giving the antibiotics once per day appeared to be less toxic to the kidneys in children.
<ABS> There were no differences between the different treatments for other outcomes.
<ABS> While once-daily treatment can be just as effective and more convenient than three-times daily treatment, we recommend further studies to look at the long-term safety of this treatment schedule.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of the most recent search: 25 November 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study.
<MaM> Data were independently extracted by each author.
<MaM> Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information.
<MaM> As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifteen studies were identified for possible inclusion in the review.
<RES> Four studies reporting results from a total of 328 participants were included in this review.
<RES> All studies compared once-daily dosing with thrice-daily dosing.
<RES> One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining three included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias.
<RES> There was no significant difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume at one second, mean difference 0.33 (95% confidence interval -2.81 to 3.48); forced vital capacity, mean difference 0.29 (95% confidence interval -6.58 to 7.16); % weight for height, mean difference -0.82 (95% confidence interval -3.77 to 2.13); body mass index, mean difference 0.00 (95% confidence interval -0.42 to 0.42); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 7.96).
<RES> The percentage change in creatinine significantly favoured once-daily treatment in children, mean difference -8.20 (95% confidence interval -15.32 to -1.08), but showed no difference in adults, mean difference 3.25 (95% confidence interval -1.82 to 8.33).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Pulse oximetry for perioperative monitoring

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Oxygen is carried around the body attached to haemoglobin in the blood.
<ABS> By passing light through the skin, pulse oximeters monitor how much oxygen the blood is carrying.
<ABS> Hypoxaemia—when the level of oxygen in the blood falls below optimal levels—is a risk during surgery when patient breathing and ventilation may be affected by anaesthesia or other drugs.
<ABS> Medical staff often monitor patients during and after surgery using pulse oximetry, but it is not clear whether this practise reduces the risk of adverse events after surgery.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effect of pulse oximeters on outcomes of surgical patients.
<ABS> In this update of the review, the search is current to June 2013.
<ABS> We identified five studies in which a total of 22,992 participants had been allocated at random to be monitored or not monitored with a pulse oximeter.
<ABS> These studies were not similar enough for their results to be combined statistically.
<ABS> Study results showed that although pulse oximetry can detect a deficiency of oxygen in the blood, its use does not affect a person's cognitive function and does not reduce the risk of complications or of dying after anaesthesia.
<ABS> These studies were large enough to show a reduction in complications, and care was taken to ensure that outcomes were assessed in the same way in both groups.
<ABS> The studies were conducted in developed countries, where standards of anaesthesia and nursing care are high.
<ABS> It is possible that pulse oximetry may have a greater impact on outcomes in other geographical areas with less comprehensive provision of health care.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a review last published in Issue 9, 2009, of The Cochrane Library.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To study the use of perioperative monitoring with pulse oximetry to clearly identify adverse outcomes that might be prevented or improved by its use.
<OBJ> The following hypotheses were tested.
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> Use of pulse oximetry is associated with improvement in the detection and treatment of hypoxaemia.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> Early detection and treatment of hypoxaemia reduce morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> Use of pulse oximetry per se reduces morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period.
<OBJ> 4.
<OBJ> Use of pulse oximetry reduces unplanned respiratory admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), decreases the length of ICU readmission or both.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2013), EMBASE (1980 to June 2013), CINAHL (1982 to June 2013), ISI Web of Science (1956 to June 2013), LILACS (1982 to June 2013) and databases of ongoing trials; we also checked the reference lists of trials and review articles.
<MaM> The original search was performed in January 2005, and a previous update was performed in May 2009.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The last update of the review identified five eligible studies.
<RES> The updated search found one study that is awaiting assessment but no additional eligible studies.
<RES> We considered studies with data from a total of 22,992 participants that were eligible for analysis.
<RES> These studies gave insufficient detail on the methods used for randomization and allocation concealment.
<RES> It was impossible for study personnel to be blinded to participant allocation in the study, as they needed to be able to respond to oximetry readings.
<RES> Appropriate steps were taken to minimize detection bias for hypoxaemia and complication outcomes.
<RES> Results indicated that hypoxaemia was reduced in the pulse oximetry group, both in the operating theatre and in the recovery room.
<RES> During observation in the recovery room, the incidence of hypoxaemia in the pulse oximetry group was 1.5 to three times less.
<RES> Postoperative cognitive function was independent of perioperative monitoring with pulse oximetry.
<RES> A single study in general surgery showed that postoperative complications occurred in 10% of participants in the oximetry group and in 9.4% of those in the control group.
<RES> No statistically significant differences in cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological or infectious complications were detected in the two groups.
<RES> The duration of hospital stay was a median of five days in both groups, and equal numbers of in-hospital deaths were reported in the two groups.
<RES> Continuous pulse oximetry has the potential to increase vigilance and decrease pulmonary complications after cardiothoracic surgery; however, routine continuous monitoring did not reduce transfer to an ICU and did not decrease overall mortality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> These studies confirmed that pulse oximetry can detect hypoxaemia and related events.
<CON> However, we found no evidence that pulse oximetry affects the outcome of anaesthesia for patients.
<CON> The conflicting subjective and objective study results, despite an intense methodical collection of data from a relatively large general surgery population, indicate that the value of perioperative monitoring with pulse oximetry is questionable in relation to improved reliable outcomes, effectiveness and efficiency.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Parental psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the parent-child relationship, with consequences for the later psychological health of the child.
<ABS> Some parenting programmes aim to improve aspects of parental wellbeing and this review specifically looked at whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving any aspects of parental psychosocial health (for example, anxiety, depression, guilt, confidence).
<ABS> We searched electronic databases for randomised controlled trials in which participants had been allocated to an experimental or a control group, and which reported results from at least one scientifically standardised measure of parental psychosocial health.
<ABS> We included a total of 48 studies that involved 4937 participants and covered three types of programme: behavioural, cognitive-behavioural and multimodal.
<ABS> Overall, the results suggested statistically significant improvements in the short-term for parental depression, anxiety, stress, anger, guilt, confidence and satisfaction with the partner relationship.
<ABS> However, only stress and confidence continued to be statistically significant at six month follow-up, and none were significant at one year.
<ABS> There was no evidence of effectiveness for self-esteem at any time point.
<ABS> None of the studies reported aggression or adverse outcomes.
<ABS> Only four studies reported the outcomes for fathers separately.
<ABS> These limited data showed a statistically significant short-term improvement in paternal stress but did not show whether the parenting programmes were helpful in terms of improving depressive symptoms, confidence or partner satisfaction.
<ABS> This review shows evidence of the short-term benefits of parenting programmes on depression, anxiety, stress, anger, guilt, confidence and satisfaction with the partner relationship.
<ABS> The findings suggest that further input may be needed to support parents to maintain these benefits.
<ABS> However, more research is needed that explicitly addresses the benefits for fathers, and that provides evidence of the comparative effectiveness of different types of programme and identifies the mechanisms involved in bringing about change.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Parental psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the parent-child relationship, with consequences for the later psychological health of the child.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched ASSIA (1980 to current) on 10 November 2012 and the National Research Register was last searched in 2005.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Control conditions could be waiting-list, no treatment, treatment as usual or a placebo.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors extracted data independently and assessed the risk of bias in each study.
<MaM> We examined the studies for any information on adverse effects.
<MaM> We contacted authors where information was missing from trial reports.
<MaM> We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 48 studies that involved 4937 participants and covered three types of programme: behavioural, cognitive-behavioural and multimodal.
<RES> Overall, we found that group-based parenting programmes led to statistically significant short-term improvements in depression (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to -0.07), anxiety (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.01), stress (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.15), anger (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.20), guilt (SMD -0.79, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.41), confidence (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.17) and satisfaction with the partner relationship (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.09).
<RES> However, only stress and confidence continued to be statistically significant at six month follow-up, and none were significant at one year.
<RES> There was no evidence of any effect on self-esteem (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.42).
<RES> None of the trials reported on aggression or adverse effects.
<RES> The limited data that explicitly focused on outcomes for fathers showed a statistically significant short-term improvement in paternal stress (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.06).
<RES> We were unable to combine data for other outcomes and individual study results were inconclusive in terms of any effect on depressive symptoms, confidence or partner satisfaction.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The findings of this review support the use of parenting programmes to improve the short-term psychosocial wellbeing of parents.
<CON> Further input may be required to ensure that these results are maintained.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Alpha2-adrenergic agonists for the management of opioid withdrawal

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Clonidine, lofexidine and similar medications for the management of opioid withdrawal

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine and tizanidine) in managing withdrawal in people who are dependent on opioid drugs (eg
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Managed withdrawal, or detoxification, is a required first step for longer-term treatments of opioid dependence.
<ABS> The combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense craving makes completion of opioid withdrawal difficult for most people.
<ABS> For many years, the main approach to detoxification involved suppression of withdrawal with methadone and gradual reduction of the methadone dose.
<ABS> The use of methadone in this way has been limited by government restrictions on prescription of methadone and dislike of the drawn out nature of methadone withdrawal.
<ABS> Clonidine and similar medications (known as alpha2-adrenergic agonists) offer an alternative approach.
<ABS> This review considered whether alpha2-adrenergic agonists are more effective than reducing doses of methadone, and whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of different types of alpha2-adrenergic agonist.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> We searched the scientific literature in August 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 25 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), involving 1668 opioid-dependent participants.
<ABS> The studies were undertaken in 11 different countries and involved treatment with an alpha2-adrenergic agonist (clonidine, lofexidine, guanfacine and in one study, tizanidine) compared with reducing doses of methadone (12 studies), placebo (five studies), or symptomatic medications (four studies).
<ABS> Five studies compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<ABS> In most studies, treatment was scheduled to last for one to two weeks; the shortest duration was three days and the longest was 30 days.
<ABS> Six studies received some financial support from a pharmaceutical company.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Opioid withdrawal was similar with alpha2-adrenergic agonists and reducing doses of methadone but the duration of treatment was longer and there were fewer adverse effects with methadone.
<ABS> Withdrawal signs and symptoms occurred earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists, within a few days of cessation of the opioid drugs.
<ABS> The chances of completing withdrawal treatment were similar.
<ABS> Clonidine and lofexidine were more effective than placebo in managing withdrawal from heroin or methadone, and were associated with higher chances of completing treatment.
<ABS> Lofexidine had less effect on blood pressure than clonidine.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> For alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, the evidence was very low to moderate quality.
<ABS> This indicates that further evidence would be likely to change the estimates of relative effect that were made in this review.
<ABS> However, the evidence is sufficient to indicate that alpha2-adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo making further comparisons of this nature inappropriate on ethical grounds.
<ABS> For the comparison of alpha2-adrenergic agonists with reducing doses of methadone, the quality is rated as low to moderate.
<ABS> The key reasons for the low quality were small numbers of studies reporting some outcomes, low rates of occurrence of some events (eg, drop-out due to adverse effects) and variability between studies.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms and overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects and completion of treatment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also contacted manufacturers in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction.
<MaM> All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants.
<RES> Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha2-adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<RES> Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.57, 3 studies, 148 participants).
<RES> Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.84, 3 studies, 148 participants).
<RES> Alpha2-adrenergic agonists were somewhat less effective than reducing doses of methadone in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.73, 5 studies, 340 participants), peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.22, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.46, 2 studies, 263 participants) and overall withdrawal severity (SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49, 3 studies, 119 participants).
<RES> These differences were not statistically significant.
<RES> The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<RES> The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD -1.07, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.83, 3 studies, 310 participants).
<RES> Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha2-adrenergic agonists (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.10, 6 studies, 464 participants) but there was no significant difference in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05, 9 studies, 659 participants).
<RES> There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<RES> Available data suggest that lofexidine does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Clonidine and lofexidine are more effective than placebo for the management of withdrawal from heroin or methadone.

<H1> Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Calcium channel blockers for primary Raynaud's phenomenon

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder whereby blood vessels in the fingers and toes constrict and reduce blood flow, causing pain and discolouration.
<ABS> This is usually in response to cold exposure or emotional stress.
<ABS> In a small number of cases, Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with an underlying disease but, for most people, it is idiopathic (of uncertain cause, or 'primary').
<ABS> Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is extremely common (especially in women), with one UK study suggesting that over 15% of the population are affected.
<ABS> For people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon who do not respond to conservative measures (e.g. keeping warm), calcium channel blockers represent the first line in drug treatment.
<ABS> Calcium channel blockers (sometimes called calcium antagonists) are drugs that affect the way calcium passes into certain muscle cells and they are the most commonly prescribed medication for primary Raynaud's phenomenon.
<ABS> This review examined seven randomised trials which included 296 participants.
<ABS> Although overall all the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias, the sample size of the included trials was small and there was unclear reporting of outcomes.
<ABS> Two different calcium channel blockers were included: nifedipine and nicardipine.
<ABS> Comparisons in six trials were with placebo and in one trial with both placebo and another type of drug (although only data relating to the calcium channel blocker and placebo were used in this case).
<ABS> Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was found to be minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon, reducing the frequency of attacks by around 1.7 attacks per person per week.
<ABS> One trial provided information on duration of attacks reporting no difference between the calcium channel blocker and placebo groups.
<ABS> Oral calcium channel blockers had no effect on severity scores in those trials in which these were assessed.
<ABS> Only two trials reported preference scores (whereby participants are asked which treatment they prefer) specifically in those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and in only one of these was there a between-treatment group difference (participants preferred nifedipine to placebo).
<ABS> Physiological measurements (for example measurement of finger blood flow) were performed in five trials, with no differences found between calcium channel blocker and placebo treatment.
<ABS> Treatment with calcium channel blockers was associated with a number of adverse events including headaches, flushing and ankle swelling.
<ABS> The results of this review were, however, limited by the low number of participants recruited to the studies and by the limitations of currently used outcome measures.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Calcium channel blockers are the most commonly prescribed drugs for people with primary Raynaud's phenomenon.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In addition the TSC searched clinical trials databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and their quality, and extracted the data.
<MaM> Data extraction included adverse events.
<MaM> We contacted trial authors for missing data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included seven randomised trials with 296 participants.
<RES> Although overall all the trials were classed as being at low or unclear risk of bias, the sample size of the included trials was small and there was unclear reporting of outcomes.
<RES> Four trials examined nifedipine and the remainder nicardipine.
<RES> Comparisons were with placebo in six trials and with both dazoxiben and placebo in one trial (only the nifedipine versus placebo data were used within this review).
<RES> Treatment with oral calcium channel blockers was minimally effective in primary Raynaud's phenomenon at decreasing the frequency of attacks (standardised mean difference of 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.38, P = 0.003).
<RES> This translates to 1.72 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.84) fewer attacks per week on calcium channel blockers compared to placebo.
<RES> One trial provided details on duration of attacks reporting no statistically significant difference between the nicardipine and placebo groups (no P value reported).
<RES> Only two trials provided any detail of statistical comparisons of (unvalidated) severity scores between treatment groups: one of these trials (60 participants) reported a mean severity score of 1.55 on placebo and 1.36 on nicardipine, difference 0.2 (95% CI of difference 0 to 0.4, no P value reported) and the other trial (three participants only with primary Raynaud's phenomenon) reported a median severity score of 2 on both nicardipine and placebo treatment (P > 0.999).
<RES> Participant-preference scores were included in four trials, but in only two were results specific to participants with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, and scoring systems differed between trials: scores differed between treatments in only one trial, in which 33% of participants on placebo and 73% on nifedipine reported improvement in symptoms (P < 0.001).
<RES> Physiological measurements were included as outcome measures in five trials (different methodologies were used in each): in none of these trials were any statistically significant between-treatment group differences found.
<RES> Treatment with calcium channel blockers appeared to be associated with a number of adverse reactions, including headaches, flushing and oedema (swelling).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, the results of this review were limited by small sample sizes in the included studies and by variable data quality, particularly with regard to outcome measures.

<H1> Interventions for the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Interventions for the treatment of twin-twin transfusion syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Limited evidence suggests the best way to improve survival without neurological impairment in children with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is to perform laser treatment to the placenta.
<ABS> Identical twins occur in about one in 320 pregnancies.
<ABS> Sometimes identical twins share the same placenta and blood flow, and the proportion of blood shared between the twins is usually equal.
<ABS> Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome happens when the blood flow is uneven and passes from one twin (the donor) to the other (the recipient).
<ABS> This can happen when the placenta has deep artery-to-vein connections.
<ABS> The donor twin usually has very little amniotic fluid, and frequently does not grow well and is very small.
<ABS> The recipient twin has excessive amniotic fluid, and often has a distended bladder and other medical problems.
<ABS> The risk of death for both twins is high, around 80% if there is no treatment.
<ABS> There is also risk of physical or neurological damage to both twins if they survive.
<ABS> Various options for treatment exist.
<ABS> These include (1) the repeated removal of excessive amniotic fluid (amnioreduction); (2) laser treatment of the abnormal vessels in the placenta (endoscopic laser surgery); (3) puncture of the membrane between the twins (septostomy); and (4) the selective ending of one twin's life (selective feticide).
<ABS> The review found three trials, involving 253 women and 506 babies.
<ABS> There were no studies on laser treatment versus puncturing the membrane, nor on selective feticide.
<ABS> The evidence showed that laser treatment was associated with more babies being alive without a neurological abnormality when compared to removing the excess amniotic fluid.
<ABS> However, where there is insufficient expertise to perform laser surgery or when the pregnancy is beyond 26 weeks, amnioreduction remains the treatment of choice.
<ABS> Further research is needed on the best treatment for mild and very severe forms of the problem.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Twin-twin transfusion syndrome, a condition affecting monochorionic twin pregnancies, is associated with a high risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of treatment modalities in twin-twin transfusion syndrome.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies (253 women and 506 babies) were included.
<RES> All three trials were judged to be of moderate quality.
<RES> One study compared amnioreduction with septostomy (71 women), whilst the other two studies compared amnioreduction with endoscopic laser coagulation (182 women).
<RES> Not all trials provided outcome data that could be included in all meta-analyses.
<RES> Amnioreduction compared with laser coagulation
<RES> Although there was no difference in overall death between amnioreduction and laser coagulation (average risk ratio (RR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.38 adjusted for clustering, two trials) or death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.09, two trials), or death of both infants per pregnancy (average RR 0.76; 95% 0.27 to 2.10, two trials), more babies were alive without neurological abnormality at the age of six years in the laser group than in the amnioreduction groups (RR 1.57; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.34 adjusted for clustering, one trial).
<RES> There were no significant differences in the babies alive at six years with major neurological abnormality treated by laser coagulation or amnioreduction (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.34 to 2.77 adjusted for clustering, one trial).
<RES> Outcomes for death in this 2013 update are different from the previous 2008 update, where improvements in perinatal death and death of both infants per pregnancy were shown in the laser intervention arm.
<RES> The NIHCD trial included in this update exerts an opposite direction of effects to the Eurofetus study, which was previously the only included laser study, hence the difference in outcome.
<RES> Amnioreduction compared with septostomy
<RES> There are no differences in overall death (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47, adjusted for clustering, one trial), death of at least one infant per pregnancy (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.35, one trial), or death of both infants per pregnancy (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.22, one trial) or gestational age at birth (RR 1.20; 95% CI -0.81 to 3.21, one trial) between amnioreduction and septostomy.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Endoscopic laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels should continue to be considered in the treatment of all stages of twin-twin transfusion syndrome to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.
<CON> Studies should aim to assess long-term outcomes of survivors.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Individuals with central nervous system disease or injury have a much higher risk of loss of bowel control and severe constipation than other people.
<ABS> This is called neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD).
<ABS> It can be very difficult to treat constipation without causing bowel leakage, or to prevent bowel leakage without causing constipation.
<ABS> The time spent on emptying the bowel is nearly always much greater for these individuals.
<ABS> Bowel problems like this cause a lot of anxiety and distress and can reduce the quality of life of those who suffer them.
<ABS> This review of research about NBD could be of interest to individuals with any damage to the central nervous system caused by disease or injury, or present at birth, which has a long term effect on how their bowel works.
<ABS> While there is a great deal of information on the causes of NBD, there are few studies that focus on how to practically manage the problem.
<ABS> Currently the usual advice is to have a good fluid intake, a balanced diet, as much physical exercise as is practical and a regular planned bowel routine.
<ABS> A bowel routine may include use of oral laxative medicines, suppositories or enemas; abdominal massage; digital rectal stimulation and digital evacuation of stool.
<ABS> The steps used will depend on the needs of each individual and some degree of trial and error is usually needed to achieve a satisfactory routine.
<ABS> Only research studies where participants were allocated to either the control group (who received either no intervention or usual care) or the treatment group by chance (called randomisation) were included in this review as these studies provide the most reliable evidence.
<ABS> Fifteen new studies have been added in this update.
<ABS> Five have been removed because the drugs the studies reported on (cisapride and tegaserod) have been withdrawn from the market and are no longer available.
<ABS> Most of the 20 randomised studies in this review included very small numbers of participants and the study reports did not always give the information needed to be sure that the study findings were reliable.
<ABS> Some oral laxatives were found to improve bowel function including psyllium, a stool-bulking laxative (one study), and an isosmotic macrogol (one study), which were both studied in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
<ABS> Some suppositories and micro-enemas used to help the bowel to open produced faster results than others (three studies) and the timing of suppository use may affect the response of the bowel (one study).
<ABS> Digital evacuation of stool may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one study).
<ABS> The use of transanal irrigation in individuals with spinal cord injury improved bowel control, constipation and quality of life measures (one study).
<ABS> Three studies found that abdominal massage was helpful in reducing constipation.
<ABS> One study found that patients may benefit from even one educational contact with a nurse.
<ABS> This review shows that there is still remarkably little research on this common problem which is so important to patients.
<ABS> The research evidence found by the review is generally very poor because the way the studies were carried out and reported means that the results are not reliable.
<ABS> It is not possible to make recommendations for care based on these studies.
<ABS> Managing NBD will continue to rely on trial and error until more high quality studies with larger numbers of participants and which examine the most important aspects of this problem are carried out.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population.
<INT> There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006.
<INT> The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected.
<MaM> Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty trials involving 902 people were included.
<RES> Oral medications
<RES> There was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) -2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.3 to -1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo.
<RES> One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92).
<RES> Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease.
<RES> These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review.
<RES> Rectal stimulants
<RES> One small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol-based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil-based (HVB).
<RES> The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository.
<RES> Physical interventions
<RES> There was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18).
<RES> A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage.
<RES> Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score).
<RES> One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25).
<RES> There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84).
<RES> Patients were also more satisfied with this method.
<RES> Other interventions
<RES> In one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one-off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months.
<RES> A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool.
<RES> Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management.
<CON> The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality.
<CON> The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other.
<CON> There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulk-forming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase-anticholinergic drug combination (neostigmine-glycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls.
<CON> However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger well-designed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> During the last two decades, doctors have been looking for the best treatment to prevent clots in the coronary arteries of patients with coronary heart disease.
<ABS> This review summarises the results of 60 studies which used a potent class of intravenous antiplatelet drugs - glycoprotein IIb-IIIa blockers - in 66,689 participants.
<ABS> This treatment was tested in two different conditions: in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty (inserting a deflated small balloon in the artery and expand it to open the vessel) with or without inserting a stent (a thin metal expandable tube or sleeve to scaffold the artery open); and as the initial treatment of patients hospitalised for unstable angina and non-ST segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (prolonged coronary chest pain with or without small myocardial infarction).
<ABS> The evidence is up to date as January 2013 and the overall quality of the body of evidence was good.
<ABS> Overall, the use of these drugs during coronary angioplasty with or without inserting a stent reduced the risk of death at 30 days, and the risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days and at six months.
<ABS> The results were similar for stable and for unstable patients with coronary artery disease, but there was comparatively less benefit for patients previously treated with clopidogrel, an oral antiplatelet drug.
<ABS> On the other side, these drugs only slightly reduced the risk of death or myocardial infarction when administered as initial medical treatment in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
<ABS> The benefits of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers need to be balanced against the increased risk of bleeding.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS), the risk of acute vessel occlusion by thrombosis is high.
<INT> Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers strongly inhibit platelet aggregation and may prevent mortality and myocardial infarction.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2007 and 2010.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We collected major bleeding as adverse effect information from the trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Sixty trials involving 66,689 patients were included.
<RES> During PCI (48 trials with 33,513 participants) glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers decreased all-cause mortality at 30 days (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97) but not at six months (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05).
<RES> All-cause death or myocardial infarction was decreased both at 30 days (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.72) and at six months (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.86), although severe bleeding was increased (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.61; absolute risk increase (ARI) 8.0 per 1000).
<RES> The efficacy results were homogeneous for every endpoint according to the clinical condition of the patients, but were less marked for patients pre-treated with clopidogrel, especially in patients without acute coronary syndromes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> When administered as initial medical treatment in patients with NSTEACS, these agents do not reduce mortality although they slightly reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction.

<H1> Omega-3 fatty acids for cystic fibrosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The use of omega-3 supplements in people with cystic fibrosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cycles of infection and inflammation are believed to worsen lung function in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> Studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids, such as those derived from fish oils, may be anti-inflammatory and may benefit many chronic inflammatory diseases including cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> This review includes four small studies with a total of 91 participants which compare omega-3 supplements to placebo.
<ABS> It was not clear if these studies had any risk of bias to the results.
<ABS> One short-term study reported that lung function and clinical status improved when taking omega-3 supplements.
<ABS> Patients also produced less sputum when taking omega-3 supplements.
<ABS> Two longer studies showed significant increases in essential fatty acid content of white blood cell membranes and serum phospholipids in people taking omega-3 supplements.
<ABS> Few adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.
<ABS> We conclude that regular omega-3 supplements may benefit people with cystic fibrosis with few adverse effects.
<ABS> However, there is not enough evidence from the four small studies included in this review to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> Larger and longer trials are needed to assess the clinical benefit of omega-3 supplementation and to determine the appropriate dosage.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of last search: 08 July 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The searches identified 14 studies; four studies with 91 participants were included.
<RES> Two studies were judged to be at low risk of bias based on adequate randomisation but this was unclear in the other two studies.
<RES> Two studies compared omega-3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks.
<RES> One study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids to one without for six months.
<RES> One study compared omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids to a control (capsules with customised fatty acid blends) for three months.
<RES> Only one short-term study (19 participants) comparing omega-3 to placebo reported a significant improvement in lung function and Shwachman score and a reduction in sputum volume in the omega-3 group.
<RES> Another study (43 participants) demonstrated a significant increase in serum phospholipid essential fatty acid content and a significant drop in the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio following omega-3 fatty acid supplementation compared to control.
<RES> The longer-term study (17 participants) demonstrated a significant increase in essential fatty acid content in neutrophil membranes and a significant decrease in the leukotriene B4 to leukotriene B5 ratio in participants taking omega-3 supplements compared to placebo.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review found that regular omega-3 supplements may provide some benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects, although evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis.
<CON> This review has highlighted the lack of data for many outcomes meaningful to people with or making treatment decisions about cystic fibrosis.
<CON> A large, long-term, multicentre, randomised controlled study is needed to determine any significant therapeutic effect and to assess the influence of disease severity, dosage and duration of treatment.
<CON> Future researchers should note the need for additional pancreatic enzymes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Methadone is widely used as a replacement for illicit opioid use such as heroin in medically-supported opioid substitution maintenance programmes.
<ABS> Two other drugs have been used to help reduce illicit opioid use, specifically buprenorphine and LAAM (levo-alpha-acetylmethadol).
<ABS> LAAM is not used in current clinical practice.
<ABS> Buprenorphine is currently used and can reduce illicit opioid use compared with placebo, although it is less effective than methadone.
<ABS> Buprenorphine is an opioid drug that is not as potent as heroin and methadone, although the effects of buprenorphine may last longer.
<ABS> Buprenorphine can be taken once every two days.
<ABS> The trials include different formulations of buprenorphine: sublingual solution, sublingual tablets, combined buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet and an implant.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review of trials found that buprenorphine at high doses (16 mg) can reduce illicit opioid use effectively compared with placebo, and buprenorphine at any dose studied retains people in treatment better than placebo.
<ABS> Buprenorphine appears to be less effective than methadone in retaining people in treatment, if prescribed in a flexible dose regimen or at a fixed and low dose (2 - 6 mg per day).
<ABS> Buprenorphine prescribed at fixed doses (above 7 mg per day) was not different from methadone prescribed at fixed doses (40 mg or more per day) in retaining people in treatment or in suppression of illicit opioid use.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We sought published/unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from authors.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used Cochrane Collaboration methodology.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 31 trials (5430 participants), the quality of evidence varied from high to moderate quality.
<RES> There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine was superior to placebo medication in retention of participants in treatment at all doses examined.
<RES> Specifically, buprenorphine retained participants better than placebo: at low doses (2 - 6 mg), 5 studies, 1131 participants, risk ratio (RR) 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 1.88; at medium doses (7 - 15 mg), 4 studies, 887 participants, RR 1.74; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.87; and at high doses (≥ 16 mg), 5 studies, 1001 participants, RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.90.
<RES> There is high quality of evidence that buprenorphine in flexible doses adjusted to participant need,was less effective than methadone in retaining participants, 5 studies, 788 participants, RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95.
<RES> For those retained in treatment, no difference was observed in suppression of opioid use as measured by urinalysis, 8 studies, 1027 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.23 to 0.02 or self report, 4 studies, 501 participants, SMD -0.11; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.07, with moderate quality of evidence.
<RES> Consistent with the results in the flexible-dose studies, in low fixed-dose studies, methadone (≤ 40 mg) was more likely to retain participants than low-dose buprenorphine (2 - 6 mg), (3 studies, 253 participants, RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.87).
<RES> However, we found contrary results at medium dose and high dose: there was no difference between medium-dose buprenorphine (7 - 15 mg) and medium-dose methadone (40 - 85 mg) in retention, (7 studies, 780 participants, RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.10) or in suppression of illicit opioid use as measured by urines, (4 studies, 476 participants, SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.58) or self report of illicit opioid use, (2 studies, 174 participants, SMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.83 to 0.19).
<RES> Similarly, there was no difference between high-dose buprenorphine (≥ 16 mg) and high-dose methadone (≥ 85 mg) in retention (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.20 to 3.16) or suppression of self-reported heroin use (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.37) (1 study, 134 participants).
<RES> Few studies reported adverse events ; two studies compared adverse events statistically, finding no difference between methadone and buprenorphine, except for a single result indicating more sedation among those using methadone.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Buprenorphine is an effective medication in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence, retaining people in treatment at any dose above 2 mg, and suppressing illicit opioid use (at doses 16 mg or greater) based on placebo-controlled trials.
<CON> However, compared to methadone, buprenorphine retains fewer people when doses are flexibly delivered and at low fixed doses.
<CON> Methadone is superior to buprenorphine in retaining people in treatment, and methadone equally suppresses illicit opioid use.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About one third of injury deaths are due to shock from blood loss.
<ABS> Preventing shock in people with uncontrolled bleeding is, therefore, very important and is generally done by giving fluids intravenously.
<ABS> The aim is to maintain blood pressure and reduce tissue damage.
<ABS> The composition of these fluids can vary, and there have been systematic reviews comparing different fluid types, but the volume of fluid given and the time at which it is given can also vary.
<ABS> It not yet clear which timing and which volume are the most effective.
<ABS> The authors searched for relevant medical research reports and found six randomised controlled trials involving a total of 2128 people.
<ABS> In each study, people with uncontrolled bleeding were randomly assigned to receive one treatment or another.
<ABS> Three studies were about the amount of fluid given (more or less), and three studies were about giving fluid at different times following injury (sooner or later).
<ABS> The authors were interested in finding out which treatments were better, to reduce deaths and to enable blood clotting.
<ABS> Blood clotting was measured by prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time during fluid administration.
<ABS> The review of trials found that there is uncertainty about the best time to give fluid and what volume of fluid should be given.
<ABS> While increasing fluids will maintain blood pressure, it may also worsen bleeding by diluting clotting factors in the blood.
<ABS> The first version of this review was published in 2000 and included these six trials.
<ABS> The authors searched for new, relevant studies in 2003, 2008 and 2014 but none were found.
<ABS> The authors will look for studies in 2020, and any new information will be incorporated into the review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We checked reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors and experts in the field.
<MaM> The most recent search was run on 5 February 2014.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised trials of the timing and volume of intravenous fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding.
<MaM> Trials in which different types of intravenous fluid were compared were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six trials involving a total of 2128 people were included in this review.
<RES> We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions and patient populations were so diverse.
<RES> Early versus delayed fluid administration
<RES> Three trials reported mortality and two reported coagulation data.
<RES> In the first trial (n = 598) the relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.58).
<RES> The WMD for partial thromboplastin time was 7.0 (95% CI 6.0 to 8.0) seconds.
<RES> In the third trial (n = 1309) the RR for death with early fluid administration was 1.06 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.47).
<RES> Larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration
<RES> Three trials reported mortality and one reported coagulation data.
<RES> In the first trial (n = 36) the RR for death with a larger volume of fluid resuscitation was 0.80 (95% CI 0.28 to 22.29).
<RES> In the third trial (n = 25) there were no deaths.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence from randomised controlled trials for or against early or larger volume of intravenous fluid administration in uncontrolled haemorrhage.
<CON> There is continuing uncertainty about the best fluid administration strategy in bleeding trauma patients.
<CON> Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the most effective fluid resuscitation strategy.

<H1> Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There is not enough evidence to show whether antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is worthwhile.
<ABS> During the early weeks of normal pregnancy, blood pressure falls and climbs slowly in later pregnancy to reach pre-pregnancy levels at term.
<ABS> Mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure) is common during pregnancy.
<ABS> In some women, it can become more serious, resulting in hospital admission, pre-eclampsia (a complication of pregnancy that includes high blood pressure) and possible premature delivery.
<ABS> Antihypertensive drugs are often used to lower blood pressure in the belief that they will prevent this progression.
<ABS> This review of 49 trials, involving 4723 women, found there was not enough evidence to show the benefit of antihypertensive drugs for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.
<ABS> More research is needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Forty-nine trials (4723 women) were included.
<RES> Twenty-nine trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3350 women).
<RES> There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drug(s) (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.13 to -0.07); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 10 (8 to 13)) but little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia (23 trials, 2851 women; RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.08).
<RES> Similarly, there is no clear effect on the risk of the baby dying (27 trials, 3230 women; RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.49 to 1.02), preterm birth (15 trials, 2141 women; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.10), or small-for-gestational-age babies (20 trials, 2586 women; RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17).
<RES> There were no clear differences in any other outcomes.
<RES> Twenty-two trials (1723 women) compared one antihypertensive drug with another.
<RES> Alternative drugs seem better than methyldopa for reducing the risk of severe hypertension (11 trials, 638 women; RR (random-effects) 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.95; RD -0.11 (-0.20 to -0.02); NNTH 7 (5 to 69)).
<RES> There is also a reduction in the overall risk of developing proteinuria/pre-eclampsia when beta blockers and calcium channel blockers considered together are compared with methyldopa (11 trials, 997 women; RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.99).
<RES> However, the effect on both severe hypertension and proteinuria is not seen in the individual drugs.
<RES> Other outcomes were only reported by a small proportion of studies, and there were no clear differences.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preterm birth is when a baby is born between 20 and 36 completed weeks' gestation.
<ABS> These babies are generally more ill and are less likely to survive than babies born at term.
<ABS> Preterm babies are also more likely to have some disability, and the earlier the baby is born the more likely they are to have problems.
<ABS> Even short-term postponement of preterm birth can improve outcomes for babies, as this gives time for the mother to be given a steroid injection to help develop the baby's lungs develop prior to birth.
<ABS> Short-term postponement of preterm birth may also give the chance to transfer the mother, if required, to somewhere where there is more expert care for the baby available.
<ABS> Drugs used to try and stop labour are called tocolytics.
<ABS> The most common drugs used are betamimetics, but calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are another option.
<ABS> CCBs are commonly used for reducing high blood pressure, but they can also relax uterine contractions.
<ABS> We looked to see if CCBs were effective in postponing labour and improving outcomes for babies, and also whether CCBs were better than betamimetics and other types of tocolytics used to postpone preterm labour and birth.
<ABS> We found 38 trials involving 3550 women, some comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with no tocolytics and others comparing CCBs with tocolytics.
<ABS> The trials included in this review were considered to be of fair quality.
<ABS> We found that CCBs, specifically nifedipine, is better than no tocolytics for postponing preterm birth for 48 hours, which may help improve outcomes for babies.
<ABS> Compared with betamimetics, CCBs were more effective at postponing birth, had fewer side effects for women, and appeared to improve some important short-term outcomes for the baby (breathing difficulties, gut infections, and admission to special care units).
<ABS> Calcium channel blockers were better than other types of tocolytics for some outcomes only.
<ABS> Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) appear to have fewer side effects for women than CCBs, but ORAs are not as good at reducing preterm birth.
<ABS> Another type of CCB, nicardipine, was only used in three trials, but was not more effective than other tocolytics.
<ABS> Longer-term infant and childhood outcomes were not able to be assessed due to lack of available information.
<ABS> In general, CCBs are more effective than betamimetics, but only sometimes more effective than other types of tocolytics.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity, affecting around 9% of births in high-income countries and an estimated 13% of births in low- and middle-income countries.
<INT> Tocolytics are drugs used to suppress uterine contractions for women in preterm labour.
<INT> The most widely used tocolytic are the betamimetics, however, these are associated with a high frequency of unpleasant and sometimes severe maternal side effects.
<INT> Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (such as nifedipine) may have similar tocolytic efficacy with less side effects than betamimetics.
<INT> Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) (e.g. atosiban) also have a low side-effect profile.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, undertook quality assessment and data extraction.
<MaM> Results are presented using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for data measured on a continuous scale with the 95% confidence interval (CI).
<MaM> The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) were calculated for categorical outcomes that were statistically significantly different.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This update includes 26 additional trials involving 2511 women, giving a total of 38 included trials (3550 women).
<RES> Thirty-five trials used nifedipine as the CCB and three trials used nicardipine.
<RES> Blinding of intervention and outcome assessment was undertaken in only one of the trials (a placebo controlled trial).
<RES> However, objective outcomes defined according to timing of birth and perinatal mortality were considered to have low risk of detection bias.
<RES> Two small trials comparing CCBs with placebo or no treatment showed a significant reduction in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.43) and an increase in maternal adverse effects (RR 49.89, 95% CI 3.13 to 795.02, one trial of 89 women).
<RES> Due to substantial heterogeneity, outcome data for preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) were not combined; one placebo controlled trial showed no difference (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03) while the other (non-placebo controlled trial) reported a reduction (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62).
<RES> No other outcomes were reported.
<RES> Comparing CCBs (mainly nifedipine) with other tocolytics by type (including betamimetics, glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch, non-steriodal anti inflammatories (NSAID), magnesium sulphate and ORAs), no significant reductions were shown in primary outcome measures of birth within 48 hours of treatment or perinatal mortality.
<RES> Comparing CCBs with betamimetics, there were fewer maternal adverse effects (average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.53) and fewer maternal adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy (average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.48).
<RES> Calcium channel blockers resulted in an increase in the interval between trial entry and birth (average MD 4.38 days, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.52) and gestational age (MD 0.71 weeks, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.09), while decreasing preterm and very preterm birth (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98 and RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93); respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86); necrotising enterocolitis (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.96); intraventricular haemorrhage (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84); neonatal jaundice (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92); and admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87).
<RES> No difference was shown in one trial of outcomes at nine to twelve years of age.
<RES> Comparing CCBs with ORA, data from one study (which did blind the intervention) showed an increase in gestational age at birth (MD 1.20 completed weeks, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.15) and reductions in preterm birth (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.89); admissions to the NICU (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85); and duration of stay in the NICU (MD -5.40 days,95% CI -10.84 to 0.04).
<RES> Maternal adverse effects were increased in the CCB group (average RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.74).
<RES> Comparing CCBs with magnesium sulphate, maternal adverse effects were reduced (average RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.68), as was duration of stay in the NICU (days) (MD -4.55, 95% CI -8.17 to -0.92).
<RES> No differences were shown in the comparisons with GTN patch or NSAID, although numbers were small.
<RES> No differences in outcomes were shown in trials comparing nicardipine with other tocolytics, although with limited data no strong conclusions can be drawn.
<RES> No differences were evident in a small trial that compared higher- versus lower-dose nifedipine, though findings tended to favour a high dose on some measures of neonatal morbidity.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Calcium channel blockers (mainly nifedipine) for women in preterm labour have benefits over placebo or no treatment in terms of postponement of birth thus, theoretically, allowing time for administration of antenatal corticosteroids and transfer to higher level care.
<CON> Calcium channel blockers were shown to have benefits over betamimetics with respect to prolongation of pregnancy, serious neonatal morbidity, and maternal adverse effects.
<CON> Calcium channel blockers may also have some benefits over ORAs and magnesium sulphate, although ORAs results in fewer maternal adverse effects.
<CON> However, it must be noted that no difference was shown in perinatal mortality, and data on longer-term outcomes were limited.
<CON> Further, the lack of blinding of the intervention diminishes the strength of this body of evidence.
<CON> Further well-designed tocolytic trials are required to determine short- and longer-term infant benefit of CCBs over placebo or no treatment and other tocolytics, particularly ORAs.
<CON> Another important focus for future trials is identifying optimal dosage regimens of different types of CCBs (high versus low, particularly addressing speed of onset of uterine quiescence) and formulation (capsules versus tablets).
<CON> All future trials on tocolytics for women in preterm labour should employ blinding of the intervention and outcome assessment, include measurement of longer-term effects into early childhood, and also costs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review has been conducted to assess the effects of using a powered (or 'electric') toothbrush compared with using a manual toothbrush for maintaining oral health.
<ABS> Dental plaque is the primary cause of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and is implicated in the progression to periodontitis, a more serious form of gum disease that affects the tissues that support the teeth.
<ABS> The build up of plaque can also lead to tooth decay.
<ABS> Both gum disease and tooth decay are the primary reasons for tooth loss.
<ABS> It is important to know whether powered toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque than manual toothbrushes, and whether their use reduces the inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) and prevents or slows the progression of periodontitis.
<ABS> It includes 56 studies published from 1964 to 2011 in which 5068 participants were randomised to receive either a powered toothbrush or a manual toothbrush.
<ABS> Majority of the studies included adults, and over 50% of the studies used a type of powered toothbrush that had a rotation oscillation mode of action (where the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other).
<ABS> There was an 11% reduction in plaque at one to three months of use, and a 21% reduction in plaque when assessed after three months of use.
<ABS> For gingivitis, there was a 6% reduction at one to three months of use and an 11% reduction when assessed after three months of use.
<ABS> The benefits of this for long-term dental health are unclear.
<ABS> Few studies reported on side effects; any reported side effects were localised and only temporary.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Removing dental plaque may play a key role maintaining oral health.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2005.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 23 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 23 January 2014), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 23 January 2014) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 23 January 2014).
<MaM> We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials.
<MaM> No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Data were classed as short term (one to three months) and long term (greater than three months).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifty-six trials met the inclusion criteria; 51 trials involving 4624 participants provided data for meta-analysis.
<RES> Five trials were at low risk of bias, five at high and 46 at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> There is moderate quality evidence that powered toothbrushes provide a statistically significant benefit compared with manual toothbrushes with regard to the reduction of plaque in both the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to -0.31); 40 trials, n = 2871) and long term (SMD -0.47 (95% CI -0.82 to -0.11; 14 trials, n = 978).
<RES> These results correspond to an 11% reduction in plaque for the Quigley Hein index (Turesky) in the short term and 21% reduction long term.
<RES> Both meta-analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity (I2 = 83% and 86% respectively) that was not explained by the different powered toothbrush type subgroups.
<RES> With regard to gingivitis, there is moderate quality evidence that powered toothbrushes again provide a statistically significant benefit when compared with manual toothbrushes both in the short term (SMD -0.43 (95% CI -0.60 to -0.25); 44 trials, n = 3345) and long term (SMD -0.21 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.12); 16 trials, n = 1645).
<RES> This corresponds to a 6% and 11% reduction in gingivitis for the Löe and Silness index respectively.
<RES> Both meta-analyses showed high levels of heterogeneity (I2 = 82% and 51% respectively) that was not explained by the different powered toothbrush type subgroups.
<RES> The number of trials for each type of powered toothbrush varied: side to side (10 trials), counter oscillation (five trials), rotation oscillation (27 trials), circular (two trials), ultrasonic (seven trials), ionic (four trials) and unknown (five trials).
<RES> The greatest body of evidence was for rotation oscillation brushes which demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in plaque and gingivitis at both time points.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Powered toothbrushes reduce plaque and gingivitis more than manual toothbrushing in the short and long term.
<CON> The clinical importance of these findings remains unclear.
<CON> Observation of methodological guidelines and greater standardisation of design would benefit both future trials and meta-analyses.
<CON> Cost, reliability and side effects were inconsistently reported.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Non-corticosteroid treatment for nephrotic syndrome in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Children with nephrotic syndrome lose excessive amounts of protein from their bloodstream into their urine, causing swelling, especially in the face, stomach and legs.
<ABS> The risk of infection also increases because important proteins used by children's immune systems have been lost.
<ABS> Corticosteroid drugs, such as prednisone, can stop protein loss, but often happens again (relapse).
<ABS> Giving children further corticosteroids can lead to poor growth, cataracts, osteoporosis and high blood pressure.
<ABS> To find out if there was evidence about non-corticosteroid drugs for children with nephrotic syndrome, and to assess what the benefits and harms of these drugs were, we analysed 32 studies that enrolled 1443 children.
<ABS> The studies compared several drugs and found that cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, levamisole and rituximab reduced the risk of relapse in children with frequently relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.
<ABS> We found that more studies are needed that compare different drug treatments to determine how these medicines should be used in children with nephrotic syndrome.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> About 80% to 90% of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) have relapses.
<INT> Of these children, around half relapse frequently, and are at risk of adverse effects from corticosteroids.
<INT> Non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive medications are used to prolong periods of remission in these children; however, these medications have significant potential adverse effects.
<INT> Currently, there is no consensus about the most appropriate second line agent in children who are steroid sensitive, but who continue to relapse.
<INT> This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2005 and 2008.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and extracted data.
<MaM> Statistical analyses were performed using a random-effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 32 studies (1443 children) of which one study is still ongoing.
<RES> In the 31 studies with data, risk of bias assessment indicated that 11 (37%) and 16 (53%) studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment respectively.
<RES> Six (29%) studies were at low risk of performance and detection bias.
<RES> Twenty seven (87%) and 19 (60%) studies were at low risk of incomplete and selective reporting respectively.
<RES> Alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) significantly reduced the risk of relapse at six to 12 months (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.60) and 12 to 24 months (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.46) compared with prednisone alone.
<RES> There was no significant difference in relapse risk at two years between chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.13).
<RES> There was no significant difference at one year between intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.29).
<RES> Cyclosporin was as effective as cyclophosphamide (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.35) and chlorambucil (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.53) at the end of therapy while levamisole (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.89) was more effective than steroids alone.
<RES> However the effects of cyclosporin and levamisole were not sustained once treatment was stopped.
<RES> In one small study cyclosporin significantly reduced the relapse rate compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MD 0.75, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.49).
<RES> Limited data from a cross-over study suggested that cyclosporin was more effective than mycophenolate mofetil in maintaining remission.
<RES> In steroid- and cyclosporin-dependent disease, rituximab significantly reduced the risk of relapse at three months compared with conventional therapy.
<RES> Mizoribine and azathioprine were no more effective than placebo or prednisone alone in maintaining remission.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Limited data indicate that mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab are valuable additional medications for relapsing SSNS.
<CON> However clinically important differences in efficacy are possible and further comparative studies are still needed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Interventions for preoperative smoking cessation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Smoking is a well-known risk factor for complications after surgery.
<ABS> Stopping smoking before surgery is likely to reduce the risk of complications.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effects of providing smoking cessation interventions to people awaiting surgery on their success in quitting at the time of surgery and longer-term, and at complications following surgery.
<ABS> The evidence is current to January 2014.
<ABS> We searched for randomized studies enrolling people who smoked and were awaiting any type of planned surgery.
<ABS> The trials tested interventions to encourage and help them to stop smoking before surgery.
<ABS> Interventions could include any type of support, including written materials, brief advice, counselling, medications such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, and combinations of different methods.
<ABS> The control could be usual care or a less intensive intervention.
<ABS> We found 13 studies which met the inclusion requirements.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was moderate, limited by the small number of studies contributing to key analyses.
<ABS> Participants were awaiting a range of different types of surgery.
<ABS> Interventions differed in their intensity, and in how long before surgery they began.
<ABS> Both brief (seven trials, 1141 participants) and intensive (two trials, 210 participants) behavioural interventions were effective in increasing the proportion of smokers who were not smoking at the time they had surgery.
<ABS> The two trials using intensive interventions which started four to eight weeks before surgery had larger effects.
<ABS> Six trials of behavioural interventions assessed postoperative complications.
<ABS> Both trials of intensive interventions (210 participants) detected a reduction in complications in people receiving intervention, but the combined results of the four trials of brief interventions did not show a significant benefit.
<ABS> Only four trials of behavioural interventions followed up participants at twelve months.
<ABS> The two intensive interventions (209 participants) reduced the number of people smoking but the two brief interventions (341 participants) no longer showed a difference in the number of smokers.
<ABS> One trial of varenicline (286 participants), a pharmacotherapy shown to assist quitting in other groups of smokers, showed a benefit on cessation after twelve months, but did not show a benefit at the time of surgery or affect complications.
<ABS> In this trial smokers were only asked to stop the day before surgery.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Smokers have a substantially increased risk of postoperative complications.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirteen trials enrolling 2010 participants met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> One trial did not report cessation as an outcome.
<RES> Seven reported some measure of postoperative morbidity.
<RES> Most studies were judged to be at low risk of bias but the overall quality of evidence was moderate due to the small number of studies contributing to each comparison.
<RES> Ten trials evaluated the effect of behavioural support on cessation at the time of surgery; nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was offered or recommended to some or all participants in eight of these.
<RES> Two trials initiated multisession face-to-face counselling at least four weeks before surgery and were classified as intensive interventions, whilst seven used a brief intervention.
<RES> One further study provided an intensive intervention to both groups, with the intervention group additionally receiving a computer-based scheduled reduced smoking intervention.
<RES> One placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of varenicline administered one week preoperatively followed by 11 weeks postoperative treatment, and one placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of nicotine lozenges from the night before surgery as an adjunct to brief counselling at the preoperative evaluation.
<RES> There was evidence of heterogeneity between the effects of trials using intensive and brief interventions, so we pooled these separately.
<RES> An effect on cessation at the time of surgery was apparent in both subgroups, but the effect was larger for intensive intervention (pooled risk ratio (RR) 10.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.55 to 25.46, two trials, 210 participants) than for brief interventions (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46, 7 trials, 1141 participants).
<RES> A single trial did not show evidence of benefit of a scheduled reduced smoking intervention.
<RES> Neither nicotine lozenges nor varenicline were shown to increase cessation at the time of surgery but both had wide confidence intervals (RR 1.34; 95% CI 0.86 to 2.10 (1 trial, 46 participants) and RR 1.49; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.26 (1 trial, 286 participants) respectively).
<RES> Four of these trials evaluated long-term smoking cessation and only the intensive intervention retained a significant effect (RR 2.96; 95% CI 1.57 to 5.55, 2 trials, 209 participants), whilst there was no evidence of a long-term effect following a brief intervention (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.75, 2 trials, 341 participants).
<RES> The trial of varenicline did show a significant effect on long-term smoking cessation (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.07, 1 trial, 286 participants).
<RES> Seven trials examined the effect of smoking intervention on postoperative complications.
<RES> As with smoking outcomes, there was evidence of heterogeneity between intensive and brief behavioural interventions.
<RES> In subgroup analyses there was a significant effect of intensive intervention on any complications (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.65, 2 trials, 210 participants) and on wound complications (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62, 2 trials, 210 participants).
<RES> For brief interventions, where the impact on smoking had been smaller, there was no evidence of a reduction in complications (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.19, 4 trials, 493 participants) for any complication (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.40, 3 trials, 325 participants) for wound complications.
<RES> The trial of varenicline did not detect an effect on postoperative complications (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.72, 1 trial, 286 participants).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is evidence that preoperative smoking interventions providing behavioural support and offering NRT increase short-term smoking cessation and may reduce postoperative morbidity.
<CON> One trial of varenicline begun shortly before surgery has shown a benefit on long-term cessation but did not detect an effect on early abstinence or on postoperative complications.
<CON> The optimal preoperative intervention intensity remains unknown.
<CON> Based on indirect comparisons and evidence from two small trials, interventions that begin four to eight weeks before surgery, include weekly counselling and use NRT are more likely to have an impact on complications and on long-term smoking cessation.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Thrombolysis for acute deep vein thrombosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a leg vein.
<ABS> The clot can break up and move to the lungs, leading to a potentially serious blockage in blood flow (pulmonary embolism or PE).
<ABS> Because of the damage to the leg vein, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) may develop any time over the next couple of years.
<ABS> Symptoms include leg pain, swelling, skin pigmentation and leg ulcers, leading to loss of mobility.
<ABS> Anticoagulants are the standard treatment for DVT or a clot in a calf vein.
<ABS> These thin the blood to reduce further clots forming and prevent PE; yet PTS can still develop.
<ABS> Thrombolysis breaks down the blood clot.
<ABS> For DVT, drugs such as streptokinase, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator are infused into a vein in the arm or foot or, in some cases, directly at the site of the clot using a catheter and X-ray control.
<ABS> Bleeding complications, stroke or intracerebral haemorrhage are potential harmful events for both treatments.
<ABS> The present review showed that thrombolysis may have advantages over standard anticoagulation treatment.
<ABS> Thrombolysis effectively dissolved the clot so that complete clot breakdown occurred more often with thrombolysis than with standard anticoagulant therapy.
<ABS> Blood flow in the affected vein (venous patency) was also better maintained.
<ABS> Four trials (341 participants) continued for over six months and found that fewer people developed PTS when treated with thrombolysis, 43% compared with 64% in the standard anticoagulation treatment group (the number needed to treat was five).
<ABS> The review results are based on 17 controlled trials that randomised a total of 1103 people with acute DVT (within 21 days of onset of symptoms) to receive thrombolysis or anticoagulant treatment.
<ABS> Trials were carried out principally in the USA, Scandinavia, Germany and the UK.
<ABS> All trials included men and women and the age range was 18 to 75 years with a preponderance of older adults.
<ABS> Those receiving thrombolysis had significantly more bleeding complications than with standard anticoagulation (10% versus 8%).
<ABS> Most bleeding episodes and deaths occurred in the earlier studies.
<ABS> Use of strict eligibility criteria has improved the safety and acceptability of this treatment, with treatment directed by catheter in more extensive clots now the favoured method.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Standard treatment for deep vein thrombosis aims to reduce immediate complications.
<INT> Use of thrombolysis or clot dissolving drugs could reduce the long-term complications of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) (pain, swelling, skin discolouration, or venous ulceration) in the affected leg.
<INT> This is the second update of a review first published in 2004.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> In the previous review of 2010, one review author (LW) selected trials, extracted data and assessed study quality, with checking at all stages by the other review author (MPA).
<MaM> If necessary, we sought additional information from trialists.
<MaM> For this update (2013), LW and CB selected trials, extracted data independently, and sought advice from MPA where necessary.
<MaM> All studies, existing and new, required full risk of bias assessment in line with current Cochrane procedures.
<MaM> Two of LW, CB and MA independently assessed risk of bias with discussion with the third author where necessary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen studies with 1103 participants were included.
<RES> Complete clot lysis occurred significantly more often in the treatment group in early follow up (risk ratio (RR) 4.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66 to 14.53, P = 0.004) and at intermediate follow up (RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.48 to 3.80, P = 0.0004).
<RES> A similar effect was seen for any degree of improvement in venous patency.
<RES> Significantly less PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis, (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.79, P < 0.0001).
<RES> Leg ulceration was reduced although the data were limited by small numbers (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.88, P = 0.29).
<RES> Those receiving thrombolysis had significantly more bleeding complications (RR 2.23; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.52, P = 0.0006).
<RES> Three strokes occurred in the treatment group, all in trials conducted pre-1990, and none in the control group.
<RES> There was no significant effect on mortality detected at either early or intermediate follow up.
<RES> Data on the occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and recurrent DVT were inconclusive.
<RES> Systemic thrombolysis is now not commonly used and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is the more favoured means of administration.
<RES> This has been studied in iliofemoral DVT, and results from two trials are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Thrombolysis increases the patency of veins and reduces the incidence of PTS following proximal DVT by a third.
<CON> Strict eligibility criteria are necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding complications and this limits the applicability of this treatment.
<CON> In those who are treated there is a small increased risk of bleeding.
<CON> In recent years CDT is the most studied route of administration, and results appear to be similar to systemic administration.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Physiotherapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In spite of various medical and surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients gradually develop significant physical problems.
<ABS> Physiotherapists aim to enable people with PD to maintain their maximum level of mobility, activity and independence through the provision of the appropriate treatment.
<ABS> A range of approaches to movement rehabilitation are used, which aim to enhance quality of life by maximising physical ability and minimising secondary complications over the whole course of the disease.
<ABS> Evidence has shown that physiotherapy has short-term benefits in PD, however which approach of physiotherapy is most effective remains unclear.
<ABS> The participants were assigned to a group in a random fashion to reduce the potential for bias.
<ABS> A total of 43 randomised trials involving 1673 participants (average trial size of just 39 participants) were identified as suitable for this review.
<ABS> The trials assessed various physiotherapy interventions, so they were grouped according to the type of intervention being used (general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance or martial arts).
<ABS> However, despite this grouping, the physiotherapy interventions delivered and the outcomes assessed varied so much that the results of the individual trials could not be combined.
<ABS> This review highlights that a wide range of different physiotherapy techniques have been tested to treat PD.
<ABS> Considering the small number of participants, the wide variety of physiotherapy interventions and the outcomes assessed, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of one approach of physiotherapy intervention over another for the treatment of PD.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Despite medical therapies and surgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD), patients develop progressive disability.
<INT> The role of physiotherapy is to maximise functional ability and minimise secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within a context of education and support for the whole person.
<INT> The overall aim is to optimise independence, safety and wellbeing, thereby enhancing quality of life.
<INT> Trials have shown that physiotherapy has short-term benefits in PD.
<INT> However, which physiotherapy intervention is most effective remains unclear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The literature search included trials published up to the end of January 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were abstracted independently from each paper by two authors.
<MaM> Trials were classified into the following intervention comparisons: general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance and martial arts.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 43 trials were identified with 1673 participants.
<RES> A wide variety of validated and customised outcome measures were used to assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions.
<RES> The content and delivery of the physiotherapy interventions varied widely in the trials included within this review, so no quantitative meta-analysis could be performed.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Considering the small number of participants examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies, the possibility of publication bias, and the variety of interventions, formal comparison of the different physiotherapy techniques could not be performed.
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of one physiotherapy intervention over another in PD.
<CON> This review shows that a wide range of physiotherapy interventions to treat PD have been tested .
<CON> There is a need for more specific trials with improved treatment strategies to underpin the most appropriate choice of physiotherapy intervention and the outcomes measured.

<H1> Perazine for schizophrenia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Perazine for schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Schizophrenia is often a severe and disabling illness that affects approximately one per cent of the worldwide population.
<ABS> Schizophrenia has 'positive' symptoms, such as strange and fixed beliefs (delusions), as well as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations).
<ABS> Schizophrenia also has 'negative' symptoms such as apathy, loss of emotion, lack of drive and disorganisation of behaviour and thought.
<ABS> The degree of disability is considerable with 80% - 90% not working and up to 10% dying.
<ABS> Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for schizophrenia, and are grouped into older drugs (first generation or ‘typical’) and newer drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’).
<ABS> However, antipsychotic drugs also have serious side effects, particularly movement disorders such as uncontrollable shaking, tremors, muscle stiffness, tiredness, weight gain and the inability to sit still.
<ABS> Perazine is an older antipsychotic drug first introduced in the 1950s.
<ABS> It is suggested to have a low level of side effects (especially for movement disorders).
<ABS> Its use is regional and restricted to countries like Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia.
<ABS> A search for trials was carried out in July 2012.
<ABS> The review now includes seven studies with a total of 479 participants and assesses the effects of perazine for people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> Comparisons of perazine versus placebo (‘dummy’ treatment) and versus other antipsychotic drugs revealed no clear differences or superiority of perazine.
<ABS> However, only a handful of studies have been undertaken and the number of participants in each study was small.
<ABS> In addition the studies avialable were of limited quality with data for the main outcomes of interest rated as low or very low quality.
<ABS> As perazine is a cheap drug and there is some limited evidence that it may cause less side effects than other older antipsychotic drugs, further large scale, well designed and well-reported studies are much needed.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Benjamin Gray from Rethink Mental Illness,
<ABS> Email: ben.gray@rethink.org.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycLIT, LILACS, PSYNDEX, Sociological Abstracts and Sociofile.
<MaM> We searched the references of all included studies for further trials.
<MaM> We contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials.
<MaM> We updated this search on 16th July 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The review authors (SL, BH, BHe) independently inspected the citations and where possible abstracts and ordered papers for re-inspection and quality assessment.
<MaM> We independently extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model.
<MaM> For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD).
<MaM> We inspected all data for heterogeneity, assessed trials for risk of bias and created summary of findings tables using GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review now includes seven trials with a total of 479 participants.
<RES> In only one trial, with 95 participants, perazine appeared superior to 'active placebo' (trimipramine) at five weeks for the outcome of 'no important global improvement' (n = 95, RR 0.43 CI 0.2 to 0.8, low quality evidence), but there was no statistically significant difference in most measures of mental state.
<RES> Perazine did not induce more general adverse events than placebo but more participants received at least one dose of antiparkinson medication (n = 95, RR 4.50 CI 1.0 to 19.5, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Six small trials comparing perazine with other antipsychotics, including 384 participants in total, were incompletely reported and the outcomes were presented in various ways so that meta-analysis was not possible on most occasions.
<RES> In the six studies, a similar number of participants receiving perazine or comparator antipsychotics (amisulpride, haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone, zotepine) left the studies early (n = 384, RR 0.97 CI 0.68 to 1.38, low quality evidence).
<RES> The results on efficacy could not be meta-analysed because the authors presented their results in very different ways.
<RES> No obvious differences in adverse events between perazine and other antipsychotics could be derived from the limited data.
<RES> Two haloperidol comparisons did not present extrapyramidal side-effects in a way that was suitable for use in meta-analysis, but three small comparisons with the second-generation antipsychotics zotepine and amisulpride showed no higher risk of akathisia (n = 111, RR 0.31 CI 0.1 to 1.1), dyskinesia (n = 111, RR 0.47 CI 0.1 to 3.5), parkinsonism (n = 81, RR 1.21 CI 0.5 2.8) or tremor (n = 40, RR 0.80 CI 0.3 to 2.6) with perazine.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The number, size and reporting of randomised controlled perazine trials are insufficient to present firm conclusions about the properties of this antipsychotic.
<CON> It is possible that perazine is associated with a similar risk of extrapyramidal side-effects as some atypical antipsychotics but this is based on small comparisons.
<CON> This should be clarified in larger, well-designed trials.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Nitric oxide donors for the treatment of preterm labour

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks) increases the baby's risk of death or disability.
<ABS> Several drugs are available to try and slow down labour so that corticosteroid drugs can be given to help the baby's lungs mature quickly.
<ABS> Nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) are drugs that may slow down contractions.
<ABS> They can cause headaches, low blood pressure and increased heart rate for the mother, but they might cause fewer problems than some of the other options.
<ABS> This review gathered the evidence on nitric oxide donors compared with no treatment and compared with other drugs to inhibit preterm labour.
<ABS> We identified 12 trials involving 1227 women.
<ABS> We found that there is not enough evidence to show whether or not nitric oxide donors can slow down preterm labour.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A number of tocolytics have been advocated for the treatment of threatened preterm labour in order to delay birth.
<INT> Nitric oxide donors, such as nitroglycerin, have been used to relax the uterus.
<INT> This review addresses their efficacy, adverse effects and influence on neonatal outcome.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twelve trials, including a total of 1227 women at risk of preterm labour, contributed data to this updated review.
<RES> The methodological quality of trials was mixed; trials comparing nitric oxide donors with other types of tocolytics were not blinded and this may have had an impact on findings.
<RES> Three studies compared nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)) with placebo.
<RES> For infant outcomes there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors reduced the risk of neonatal death or serious morbidity (stillbirth RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.59, one study, 153 infants; neonatal death RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.89, two studies, 186 infants).
<RES> One study, using a composite outcome, reported a reduced risk of serious adverse outcomes for infants in the GTN group which approached statistical significance (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.00, 153 infants).
<RES> Overall, these studies were underpowered to identify differences between groups for most outcomes.
<RES> When nitric oxide donors were compared with other tocolytic drugs there was no significant evidence that nitric oxide donors performed better than other tocolytics (betamimetics, magnesium sulphate, a calcium channel blocker or a combination of tocolytics) in terms of pregnancy prolongation, although nitric oxide donors appeared to be associated with a reduction in most adverse effects, apart from headache.
<RES> There was no significant difference between groups for infant morbidity or mortality outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Physicians and other healthcare professionals often prescribe drugs that will only work at certain concentrations.
<ABS> These drugs are said to have a narrow therapeutic window.
<ABS> This means that if the concentration of the drug is too high or too low, they may cause serious side effects or not provide the benefits they should.
<ABS> For example, blood thinners (anticoagulants) are prescribed to thin the blood to prevent clots.
<ABS> If the concentration is too high, people may experience excessive bleeding and even death.
<ABS> In contrast, if the concentration is too low, a clot could form and cause a stroke.
<ABS> For these types of drugs, it is important that the correct amount of the drug be prescribed.
<ABS> Calculating and prescribing the correct amount can be complicated and time-consuming for healthcare professionals.
<ABS> Sometimes determining the correct dose can take a long time since healthcare professionals may not want to prescribe high doses of the drugs initially because they make mistakes in calculations.
<ABS> Several computer systems have been designed to do these calculations and assist healthcare professionals in prescribing these types of drugs.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We sought clinical trial evidence from scientific databases to evaluate the effectiveness of these computer systems.
<ABS> The evidence is current to January 2012.
<ABS> We found data from 42 trials (40 randomized controlled trials (trials that allocate people at random to receive one of a number of drugs or procedures) and two non-randomized controlled trials).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Computerized advice for drug dosage can benefit people taking certain drugs compared with empiric dosing (where a dose is chosen based on a doctor's observations and experience) without computer assistance.
<ABS> When using the computer system, healthcare professionals prescribed appropriately higher doses of the drugs initially for aminoglycoside antibiotics and the correct drug dose was reached more quickly for oral anticoagulants.
<ABS> It significantly decreased thromboembolism (blood clotting) events for anticoagulants and tended to reduce unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics and anti-rejection drugs (although not an important difference).
<ABS> It tended to reduce the length of hospital stay compared with routine care with comparable or better cost-effectiveness.
<ABS> There was no evidence of effects on death or clinical side events for insulin (low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs (drugs taken to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ) and antidepressants.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The quality of the studies was low so these results must be interpreted with caution.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Maintaining therapeutic concentrations of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window is a complex task.
<INT> Several computer systems have been designed to help doctors determine optimum drug dosage.
<INT> This is an updated version of an earlier Cochrane systematic review, first published in 2001 and updated in 2008.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The following databases were searched from 1996 to January 2012: EPOC Group Specialized Register, Reference Manager; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid; EMBASE, Ovid; and CINAHL, EbscoHost.
<MaM> A "top up" search was conducted for the period January 2012 to January 2013; these results were screened by the authors and potentially relevant studies are listed in Studies Awaiting Classification.
<MaM> The review authors also searched reference lists of relevant studies and related reviews.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses of computerized advice on drug dosage.
<MaM> The participants were healthcare professionals responsible for patient care.
<MaM> The outcomes were any objectively measured change in the health of patients resulting from computerized advice (such as therapeutic drug control, clinical improvement, adverse reactions).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality.
<MaM> We grouped the results from the included studies by drug used and the effect aimed at for aminoglycoside antibiotics, amitriptyline, anaesthetics, insulin, anticoagulants, ovarian stimulation, anti-rejection drugs and theophylline.
<MaM> We combined the effect sizes to give an overall effect for each subgroup of studies, using a random-effects model.
<MaM> We further grouped studies by type of outcome when appropriate (i.e. no evidence of heterogeneity).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Forty-six comparisons (from 42 trials) were included (as compared with 26 comparisons in the last update) including a wide range of drugs in inpatient and outpatient settings.
<RES> All were randomized controlled trials except two studies.
<RES> Interventions usually targeted doctors, although some studies attempted to influence prescriptions by pharmacists and nurses.
<RES> Drugs evaluated were anticoagulants, insulin, aminoglycoside antibiotics, theophylline, anti-rejection drugs, anaesthetic agents, antidepressants and gonadotropins.
<RES> Although all studies used reliable outcome measures, their quality was generally low.
<RES> This update found similar results to the previous update and managed to identify specific therapeutic areas where the computerized advice on drug dosage was beneficial compared with routine care:
<RES> It tended to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics (nephrotoxicity: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06) and anti-rejection drugs (cytomegalovirus infections: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40);
<RES> For all outcomes, statistical heterogeneity quantified by I2 statistics was moderate to high.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review update suggests that computerized advice for drug dosage has some benefits: it increases the serum concentrations for aminoglycoside antibiotics and improves the proportion of people for which the plasma drug is within the therapeutic range for aminoglycoside antibiotics.
<CON> It leads to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants and insulin.
<CON> It decreases the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants.
<CON> It tends to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics and anti-rejection drugs, and it significantly decreases thromboembolism events for anticoagulants.
<CON> It tends to reduce the length of hospital stay compared with routine care while comparable or better cost-effectiveness ratios were achieved.
<CON> However, there was no evidence that decision support had an effect on mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypoglycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants.
<CON> In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that some decision support technical features (such as its integration into a computer physician order entry system) or aspects of organization of care (such as the setting) could optimize the effect of computerized advice.
<CON> Taking into account the high risk of bias of, and high heterogeneity between, studies, these results must be interpreted with caution.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Face masks are thought to reduce the number of postoperative wound infections.
<ABS> Incorrectly worn masks may increase the contamination of the wound.
<ABS> This review of trials found no clear evidence that wearing disposable face masks increases or reduces the number of surgical wound infections in clean surgery.
<ABS> More research is needed.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors extracted data independently.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background: what is osteoarthritis and what is herbal therapy?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints (commonly knees, hips, hands).
<ABS> When joints lose cartilage, bone grows to try to repair the damage.
<ABS> Instead of making things better, however, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse.
<ABS> For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and limit movement.
<ABS> OA can affect your physical function, particularly your ability to use your joints.
<ABS> Herbal medicines are defined as being finished, labelled medicinal products that contain as active ingredients aerial or underground parts of plants or other plant material, or combinations thereof, whether in the crude state or as plant preparations (for example extracts, oils, tinctures).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This summary of an update of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effects of herbal therapies consumed orally by people with osteoarthritis.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies to August 2013, we included 45 new studies since the last review, giving a total of 49 studies (on 33 herbal interventions) that included 5980 participants, most with mild to moderate symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.
<ABS> Thirty-three different medicinal plant products were compared with placebo or active intervention controls and many comparisons had single studies only; thus, we have restricted reporting of results here to multiple studies of Boswellia serrata (monoherbal) and avocado-soyabean unsaponifiables (ASU) (two herb combination) products.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Boswellia serrata
<ABS> Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain):
<ABS> - people who used enriched Boswellia serrata extract 100 mg rated their pain as 23 points;
<ABS> - people who used a placebo preparation rated their pain as 40 points.
<ABS> Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores means better physical function):
<ABS> - people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their physical function 8 points better (2 to 14 points better) on a 100 point scale (8% absolute improvement) at 90 days compared with placebo;
<ABS> - people who used 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract rated their physical function as 25 points;
<ABS> - people who used placebo rated their physical function as 33 points.
<ABS> Avocado-soyabean unsaponifiables (ASU) product Piascledine®
<ABS> Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean less pain):
<ABS> - people who used ASU 300 mg rated their pain 8 points lower (1 to 16 points lower) on a 100 point scale (8% absolute improvement) at 3 to 12 months compared with placebo;
<ABS> - people who used ASU 300 mg rated their pain as 33 points;
<ABS> - people who used placebo rated their pain as 41 points.
<ABS> Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 mm scale (lower scores means better physical function):
<ABS> - people who used ASU 300 mg rated their physical function 7 mm better (2 to 12 mm better) on a 100 mm scale (7% absolute improvement) at 3 to 12 months compared with placebo;
<ABS> - people who used ASU 300 mg rated their physical function as 40 mm;
<ABS> - people who used placebo rated their physical function as 47 mm.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> There is high-quality evidence that in people with osteoarthritis Boswellia serrata slightly improved pain and function.
<ABS> Further research is unlikely to change the estimates.
<ABS> There is moderate-quality evidence that avocado-soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) probably improved pain and function slightly, but may not preserve joint space.
<ABS> Further research may change the estimates.
<ABS> We are uncertain whether other oral herbal products improve osteoarthritis pain or function, or slow progression of joint structure damage because the available evidence is limited to single studies or studies that cannot be pooled, and some of these studies are of low to very low quality.
<ABS> Quality of life was not measured.
<ABS> Herbal therapies may cause side effects, however we are uncertain if there is an increased risk of these.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Medicinal plant products are used orally for treating osteoarthritis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Forty-nine randomised controlled studies (33 interventions, 5980 participants) were included.
<RES> Seventeen studies of confirmatory design (sample and effect sizes pre-specified) were mostly at moderate risk of bias.
<RES> The remaining 32 studies of exploratory design were at higher risk of bias.
<RES> Due to differing interventions, meta-analyses were restricted to Boswellia serrata (monoherbal) and avocado-soyabean unsaponifiables (ASU) (two herb combination) products.
<RES> Five studies of three different extracts from Boswellia serrata were included.
<RES> High-quality evidence from two studies (85 participants) indicated that 90 days treatment with 100 mg of enriched Boswellia serrata extract improved symptoms compared to placebo.
<RES> Mean pain was 40 points on a 0 to 100 point VAS scale (0 is no pain) with placebo, enriched Boswellia serrata reduced pain by a mean of 17 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 8 to 26); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 2; the 95% CIs did not exclude a clinically significant reduction of 15 points in pain.
<RES> Physical function was 33 points on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) 0 to 100 point subscale (0 is no loss of function) with placebo, enriched Boswellia serrata improved function by 8 points (95% CI 2 to 14); NNTB 4.
<RES> Assuming a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points, we cannot exclude a clinically important benefit in some people.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence (one study, 96 participants) indicated that adverse events were probably reduced with enriched Boswellia serrata (18/48 events versus 30/48 events with placebo; relative risk (RR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92).
<RES> Possible benefits of other Boswellia serrata extracts over placebo were confirmed in moderate-quality evidence from two studies (97 participants) of Boswellia serrata (enriched) 100 mg plus non-volatile oil, and low-quality evidence from small single studies of a 999 mg daily dose of Boswellia serrata extract and 250 mg daily dose of enriched Boswellia serrata.
<RES> It was uncertain if a 99 mg daily dose of Boswellia serrata offered benefits over valdecoxib due to the very low-quality evidence from a small single study.
<RES> It was uncertain if there was an increased risk of adverse events or withdrawals with Boswellia serrata extract due to variable reporting of results across studies.
<RES> The studies reported no serious adverse events.
<RES> Quality of life and radiographic joint changes were not measured.
<RES> Six studies examined the ASU product Piasclidine®.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence from four studies (651 participants) indicated that ASU 300 mg produced a small and clinically questionable improvement in symptoms, and probably no increased adverse events compared to placebo after three to 12 months treatment.
<RES> Mean pain with placebo was 40.5 points on a VAS 0 to 100 scale (0 is no pain), ASU 300 mg reduced pain by a mean of 8.5 points (95% CI 1 to 16 points); NNTB 8.
<RES> ASU 300 mg improved function (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.42, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.11).
<RES> Function was estimated as 47 mm (0 to 100 mm scale, where 0 is no loss of function) with placebo, ASU 300 mg improved function by a mean of 7 mm (95% CI 2 to 12 mm); NNTB 5 (3 to 19).
<RES> There were no differences in adverse events (5 studies, 1050 participants) between ASU (53%) and placebo (51%) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12); withdrawals due to adverse events (1 study, 398 participants) between ASU (17%) and placebo (15%) (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.80); or serious adverse events (1 study, 398 participants) between ASU (40%) and placebo (33%) (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.59).
<RES> Radiographic joint changes, measured as change in joint space width (JSW) in two studies (453 participants) did not differ between ASU 300 mg treatment (-0.53 mm) and placebo (-0.65 mm); mean difference of -0.12 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.19).
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence from a single study (156 participants) confirmed possible benefits of ASU 600 mg over placebo, with no increased adverse events.
<RES> Low-quality evidence (1 study, 357 participants) indicated there may be no differences in symptoms or adverse events between ASU 300 mg and chondroitin sulphate.
<RES> Quality of life was not measured.
<RES> All other herbal interventions were investigated in single studies, limiting conclusions.
<RES> No serious side effects related to any plant product were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence for the proprietary ASU product Piasclidine® in the treatment of osteoarthritis symptoms seems moderate to high for short term use, but studies over a longer term and against an apparently active control are less convincing.
<CON> Several other medicinal plant products, including extracts of Boswellia serrata, show trends of benefits that warrant further investigation in light of the fact that the risk of adverse events appear low.
<CON> There is no evidence that Piasclidine® significantly improves joint structure, and limited evidence that it prevents joint space narrowing.
<CON> Structural changes were not tested for with any other herbal intervention.
<CON> Further investigations are required to determine optimum daily doses producing clinical benefits without adverse events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acoustic stimulation of unborn babies may make tests on their wellbeing more effective.
<ABS> Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound, measuring the number of movements and the heart rate are carried out to check the baby’s wellbeing.
<ABS> As a baby's sleep periods can alter these results by making it non-reactive, various methods are used to wake the baby so that it can respond to the stimulus.
<ABS> Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation uses a hand-held electronic device placed just above the pregnant woman's abdomen.
<ABS> Brief sounds are sent through the mother’s abdomen to her baby.
<ABS> The vibroacoustic stimulation gives the opportunity to assess how the baby responds.
<ABS> Exposure of the baby to the vibroacoustic stimulation is generally considered safe but it can cause vigorous fetal movements and fetal distress.
<ABS> This review of 12 randomised controlled trials involving 6822 mothers found that vibroacoustic stimulation improved the effectiveness of the baby's heart rate testing.
<ABS> However, the data on fetal distress and perinatal death were too few to draw any conclusions on safety.
<ABS> More research is needed to determine the optimal intensity, frequency, duration and position of the vibroacoustic stimulation and to evaluate the safety and perinatal outcomes when used with cardiotocography and other tests of fetal wellbeing.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.
<MaM> Authors of published and unpublished trials were contacted for further information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Altogether 12 trials with a total of 6822 participants were included.
<RES> Fetal vibroacoustic stimulation reduced the incidence of non-reactive antenatal cardiotocography test (nine trials; average risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.81).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Vibroacoustic stimulation offers benefits by decreasing the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography and reducing the testing time.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When a mother's own breast milk is not available for feeding her preterm or low birth weight infant, the alternatives are either formula or expressed breast milk from a donor mother ('donor breast milk').
<ABS> This review of nine randomised controlled trials suggests that feeding with formula increases short-term growth rates, but is associated with a higher risk of developing the severe gut disorder called 'necrotising enterocolitis'.
<ABS> There is no evidence of an effect on longer-term growth or on development.
<ABS> Further trials that compare these two strategies are needed.
<ABS> These should probably compare formula adapted for preterm infants with donor breast milk supplemented with extra nutrients.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, feeding with artificial formula may ensure more consistent delivery of optimal levels of nutrients.
<INT> Uncertainty exists about the balance of risks and benefits of feeding formula versus donor breast milk for preterm or low birth weight infants.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine trials, in which 1070 infants participated, fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
<RES> Four trials compared standard term formula versus donor breast milk and five compared nutrient-enriched preterm formula versus donor breast milk.
<RES> Only the two most recent trials used nutrient-fortified donor breast milk.
<RES> The trials contain various methodological quality weaknesses, specifically uncertainty about adequate allocation concealment methods in three trials and lack of blinding in most of the trials.
<RES> Formula-fed infants had higher in hospital rates of increase in weight [mean difference (MD): 2.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 to 3.71) g/kg/day], length [MD 1.93 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.62) mm/week] and head circumference [MD 1.59 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.24) mm/week].
<RES> We did not find evidence of an effect on post-discharge growth rates or neurodevelopmental outcomes.
<RES> Formula feeding increased the risk of necrotising enterocolitis: typical risk ratio 2.77 (95% CI 1.40 to 5.46); risk difference 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk results in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis.
<CON> Limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk are available.
<CON> This limits the applicability of the findings of this review as nutrient fortification of breast milk is now a common practice in neonatal care.
<CON> Future trials may compare growth, development and adverse outcomes in infants who receive formula milk versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk given as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk or as a sole diet.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Self management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> In research, another word for well-being is health-related quality of life.
<ABS> Self management training teaches patients the skills and behaviours they need to successfully manage their disease.
<ABS> Self-management training is becoming more and more important in the treatment of COPD.
<ABS> However, debate on the most effective content is ongoing.
<ABS> Therefore, we reviewed the evidence on the effects of self management on health-related quality of life and on healthcare use in patients with COPD.
<ABS> The evidence is current to August 2011.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> In this review, we assessed 29 studies that evaluated the effects of self management.
<ABS> Patients in these studies were followed for two to 24 months.
<ABS> Twenty-three studies had a control group that received usual care.
<ABS> A total of 3189 patients participated in these studies.
<ABS> In six studies, different components of self management were compared on a head-to-head basis.
<ABS> Content and duration of the self management programmes were diverse.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Analysis of the studies revealed that self management training improved health-related quality of life in patients with COPD compared with usual care.
<ABS> Also, the number of patients with at least one hospital admission related to lung disease was reduced among those who participated in a self management intervention.
<ABS> These patients also experienced less shortness of breath.
<ABS> We found trials that compared different types of self management interventions versus each other.
<ABS> We had hoped that these trials would help us identify the most effective components of self management.
<ABS> However, all interventions were different, and we were unable to draw out the key themes.
<ABS> The studies assessed in this review were diverse.
<ABS> Self management programmes differed in content and duration.
<ABS> Also, types of participants differed across studies.
<ABS> Therefore, no clear recommendations on the most effective content of self management training can be made at this time.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Since the first update of this review in 2007, several studies have been published.
<INT> The results of the second update are reported here.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> 2.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Interventions with fewer than two contact moments between study participants and healthcare providers were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Investigators were contacted to ask for additional information.
<MaM> When appropriate, study results were pooled using a random-effects model.
<MaM> The primary outcomes of the review were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and number of hospital admissions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-nine studies were included.
<RES> Twenty-three studies on 3189 participants compared self management versus usual care; six studies on 499 participants compared different components of self management on a head-to-head basis.
<RES> Although we included non-randomised controlled clinical trials as well as RCTs in this review, we restricted the primary analysis to RCTs only and reported these trials in the abstract.
<RES> In the 23 studies with a usual care control group, follow-up time ranged from two to 24 months.
<RES> The content of the interventions was diverse.
<RES> A statistically relevant effect of self management on HRQoL was found (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, mean difference (MD) -3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.37 to -1.65, 10 studies, 1413 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Self management also led to a lower probability of respiratory-related hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR) 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75, nine studies, 1749 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Over one year of follow-up, eight (95% CI 5 to 14) participants with a high baseline risk of respiratory-related hospital admission needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one hospital admission, and 20 (95% CI 15 to 35) participants with a low baseline risk of hospitalisation needed to be treated to prevent one participant with at least one respiratory-related hospital admission.
<RES> No statistically significant effect of self management on all-cause hospitalisation (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.30, 6 studies, 1365 participants, low-quality evidence) or mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.07, 8 studies, 2134 participants, very low-quality evidence) was detected.
<RES> Also, dyspnoea measured by the (modified) Medical Research Council Scale ((m)MRC) was reduced in individuals who participated in self management (MD -0.83, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.30, 3 studies, 119 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> The difference in exercise capacity as measured by the six-minute walking test was not statistically significant (MD 33.69 m, 95% CI -9.12 to 76.50, 6 studies, 570 participants, very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Subgroup analyses depending on the use of an exercise programme as part of the intervention revealed no statistically significant differences between studies with and without exercise programmes in our primary outcomes of HRQoL and respiratory-related hospital admissions.
<RES> We were unable to pool head-to-head trials because of heterogeneity among interventions and controls; thus results are presented narratively within the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Self management interventions in patients with COPD are associated with improved health-related quality of life as measured by the SGRQ, a reduction in respiratory-related hospital admissions, and improvement in dyspnoea as measured by the (m)MRC.
<CON> No statistically significant differences were found in other outcome parameters.
<CON> However, heterogeneity among interventions, study populations, follow-up time and outcome measures makes it difficult to formulate clear recommendations regarding the most effective form and content of self management in COPD.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hip fractures are common in elderly people, who often have medical conditions that put them at risk of developing other problems whilst their fracture is treated.
<ABS> Treatment usually involves an operation to fix the break in the bone, and it is possible that giving too much or too little fluid to a patient around this time may increase the risk of further problems.
<ABS> Healthcare staff can use many approaches in trying to determine how much fluid a patient needs in this situation, but it is not clear if some methods are better than others.
<ABS> We searched the databases to October 2012 and identified three studies (randomized controlled trials) with a total of 200 people, each of which compared two or three methods of guiding fluid therapy.
<ABS> These methods include 'usual care' (where staff use changes in basic measurements, such as heart rate, to decide for themselves how much fluid to give), 'protocols using standard measures' (where staff use changes in basic measurements to give fluid according to a formal set of rules) and 'advanced haemodynamic monitoring' (where staff use equipment, such as specialized blood pressure monitoring devices placed into arteries, to guide how much fluid to give).
<ABS> These trials found no evidence that using one method instead of another reduces harm, including death or number of complications.
<ABS> One study suggests that length of stay in the hospital may be reduced if protocols or advanced haemodynamic methods are used, but because the number of people studied is not large, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about this.
<ABS> No information was found regarding differences in the time taken for people to return to their previous type of accommodation or level of mobility.
<ABS> Two ongoing studies may provide more information in the future.
<ABS> The quality of evidence in a review may be high, moderate, low or very low.
<ABS> In this review, the evidence was assessed as being of low quality for all outcomes except time to medical fitness for discharge, for which the quality of evidence was moderate.
<ABS> Research findings to this point are insufficient to show how one can best optimize fluid levels in the large number of people around the world suffering from hip fracture.
<ABS> This is an update of a review published in 2004.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Proximal femoral fracture (PFF) is a common orthopaedic emergency, affecting mainly elderly people at high risk of complications.
<INT> Advanced methods for managing fluid therapy during treatment for PFF are available, but their role in reducing risk is unclear.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To compare the safety and effectiveness of different methods of perioperative fluid optimization in adult participants undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture.
<OBJ> We considered the following methods: advanced invasive haemodynamic monitoring, such as transoesophageal Doppler and pulse contour analysis; a protocol using standard measures, such as blood pressure, urine output and central venous pressure; and usual care.
<OBJ> Comparisons of fluid types (e.g. crystalloid vs colloid) and other methods of optimizing oxygen delivery, such as blood product therapies and pharmacological treatment with inotropes and vasoactive drugs, are considered elsewhere.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2012); and EMBASE (1980 to October 2012) without language restrictions.
<MaM> This is an updated version of a review published in 2004.
<MaM> The original search was performed in October 2003.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We pooled data using risk ratio or mean difference for dichotomous or continuous data, respectively, based on random-effects models.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three RCTs with a total of 200 participants.
<RES> One of these included studies was found to have a high risk of bias; no trial featured all pre-specified outcomes.
<RES> We found one trial for which data are awaited for classification and two ongoing trials.
<RES> One included study with low risk of bias found that compared with usual care, time to medical fitness for discharge was shorter with the use of advanced haemodynamic monitoring (mean reduction 6.20 days, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.1 days; 59 participants, one trial) and with the use of protocols that apply standard measures (mean reduction 3.9 days, 95% CI 0.75 to 7.05; 57 participants, one trial).
<RES> Our results are consistent with both increased and decreased risk of mortality and adverse events in participants receiving the intervention.
<RES> No data for other outcomes were available.
<RES> Our results are limited by the quantity of available data.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Three studies considering a total of 200 participants reveal an absence of evidence that fluid optimization strategies improve outcomes for participants undergoing surgery for PFF.
<CON> Length of hospital stay may be improved, but lack of good quality data leaves uncertainty.
<CON> Further research powered to test some of these outcomes is ongoing.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation after surgery for herniation of the lumbar disc

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effects of rehabilitation programmes on pain, recovery, function and return to work in people who have had lumbar disc surgery.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A 'slipped' or 'herniated' disc is thought to be the most common cause of leg pain associated with a 'pinched' or compressed nerve in the lower back.
<ABS> Many patients are treated with a combination of non-surgical measures such as medication or physiotherapy.
<ABS> Rehabilitation  programmes, such as exercise therapy by a physiotherapist and advice to return to normal activities like returning to work, are common approaches after surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.
<ABS> Most commonly, treatment started four to six weeks after surgery, but the start of treatment ranged from two hours to 12 months after surgery.
<ABS> Considerable variation in the content, duration and intensity of treatments (i.e. exercise programmes) has been noted.
<ABS> The duration of the interventions varied from two weeks to one year; most programmes lasted six to 12 weeks.
<ABS> Participants reported on average serious pain intensity (56 points on a zero to 100 scale, with 100 being the worst possible pain).
<ABS> Most studies compared (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity exercise versus low-intensity exercise or (3) supervised exercise versus home exercise, most commonly starting four to six weeks after surgery.
<ABS> Comparisons in this review included (1) exercise versus no treatment, (2) high-intensity versus low-intensity exercise and (3) supervised versus home exercise.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Patients who participated in exercise programmes four to six weeks after surgery reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those who received no treatment.
<ABS> Patients who participated in high-intensity exercise programmes reported slightly less short-term pain and disability than those participating in low-intensity exercise programmes.
<ABS> Patients in supervised exercise programmes reported little or no difference in pain and disability compared with those in home exercise programmes.
<ABS> Here it was difficult to draw firm conclusions in the absence of high-quality evidence.
<ABS> None of the trials reported an increase in reoperation rate after first-time lumbar surgery.
<ABS> The evidence does not show whether all patients should be treated after surgery or only those who still have symptoms four to six weeks later.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Limitations in the methods of half of the trials suggest that the results should be read with caution.
<ABS> Most of the treatments were assessed in only one trial.
<ABS> Therefore for most of the interventions, only low- to very low-quality evidence indicates that no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding their effectiveness.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether active rehabilitation after lumbar disc surgery is more effective than no treatment, and to describe which type of active rehabilitation is most effective.
<OBJ> This is the second update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002.
<OBJ> First, we clustered treatments according to the start of treatment.1.
<OBJ> Active rehabilitation that starts immediately postsurgery.2.
<OBJ> Active rehabilitation that starts four to six weeks postsurgery.3.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and risk of bias.
<MaM> Meta-analyses were performed if studies were clinically homogeneous.
<MaM> The GRADE approach was used to determine the overall quality of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In this update, we identified eight new studies, thereby including a total of 22 trials (2503 participants), 10 of which had a low risk of bias.
<RES> Most rehabilitation programmes were assessed in only one study.
<RES> Both men and women were included, and overall mean age was 41.4 years.
<RES> All participants had received standard discectomy, microdiscectomy and in one study standard laminectomy and (micro)discectomy.
<RES> Mean duration of the rehabilitation intervention was 12 weeks; eight studies assessed six to eight-week exercise programmes, and eight studies assessed 12 to 13-week exercise programmes.
<RES> Programmes were provided in primary and secondary care facilities and were started immediately after surgery (n = 4) or four to six weeks (n = 16) or one year after surgery (n = 2).
<RES> In general, the overall quality of the evidence is low to very low.
<RES> Rehabilitation programmes that started immediately after surgery were not more effective than their control interventions, which included exercise.
<RES> Low- to very low-quality evidence suggests that there were no differences between specific rehabilitation programmes (multidisciplinary care, behavioural graded activity, strength and stretching) that started four to six weeks postsurgery and their comparators, which included some form of exercise.
<RES> Low-quality evidence shows that physiotherapy from four to six weeks postsurgery onward led to better function than no treatment or education only, and that multidisciplinary rehabilitation co-ordinated by medical advisors led to faster return to work than usual care.
<RES> Statistical pooling was performed only for three comparisons in which the rehabilitation programmes started four to six weeks postsurgery: exercise programmes versus no treatment, high- versus low-intensity exercise programmes and supervised versus home exercise programmes.
<RES> Very low-quality evidence (five RCTs, N = 272) shows that exercises are more effective than no treatment for pain at short-term follow-up (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.55 to -0.24), and low-quality evidence (four RCTs, N = 252) suggests that exercises are more effective for functional status on short-term follow-up (SMD -0.67; 95% CI -1.22 to -0.12) and that no difference in functional status was noted on long-term follow-up (three RCTs, N = 226; SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.49 to 0.04).
<RES> None of these studies reported that exercise increased the reoperation rate.
<RES> Very low-quality evidence (two RCTs, N = 103) shows that high-intensity exercise programmes are more effective than low-intensity exercise programmes for pain in the short term (weighted mean difference (WMD) -10.67; 95% CI -17.04 to -4.30), and low-quality evidence (two RCTs, N = 103) shows that they are more effective for functional status in the short term (SMD -0.77; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.36).
<RES> Very low-quality evidence (four RCTs, N = 154) suggests no significant differences between supervised and home exercise programmes for short-term pain relief (SMD -0.76;  95% CI -2.04 to 0.53) or functional status (four RCTs, N = 154; SMD -0.36; 95% CI -0.88 to 0.15).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Considerable variation was noted in the content, duration and intensity of the rehabilitation programmes included in this review, and for none of them was high- or moderate-quality evidence identified.
<CON> Exercise programmes starting four to six weeks postsurgery seem to lead to a faster decrease in pain and disability than no treatment, with small to medium effect sizes, and high-intensity exercise programmes seem to lead to a slightly faster decrease in pain and disability than is seen with low-intensity programmes, but the overall quality of the evidence is only low to very low.
<CON> No significant differences were noted between supervised and home exercise programmes for pain relief, disability or global perceived effect.
<CON> None of the trials reported an increase in reoperation rate after first-time lumbar surgery.
<CON> High-quality randomised controlled trials are strongly needed.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.
<ABS> In the majority of patients, hepatocellular carcinoma is diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease and is mostly accompanied by liver cirrhosis.
<ABS> To date, there is no medical cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and treatment aims to slow tumour growth.
<ABS> In high-income countries, about 30% of patients present with the more favourable early hepatocellular carcinoma.
<ABS> For these patients, percutaneous ablation techniques (destruction of the cancer cells by heat, cold, or chemical substances such as ethanol), surgical resection (removal of part of the liver), and liver transplantation (which is limited by organ donor shortage) are currently considered potentially curative treatments.
<ABS> Radiofrequency (thermal) ablation (RFA) is the most elaborated of the percutaneous interventions, so far.
<ABS> Heat caused by alternating electric current is administered by probes that are inserted through the skin (percutaneously).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature in order to clarify the role of RFA for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and to compare its benefits and harms with no treatment, placebo (a pretend treatment), or other treatments (such as hepatic resection, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI), laser or microwave ablation, and liver transplantation).
<ABS> We looked for randomised clinical trials (where people were allocated at random to one of two or more treatments groups) of people with hepatocellular carcinoma who were able to receive RFA.
<ABS> Evidence is current to September 2013.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> We found no trials comparing RFA versus no intervention, placebo, chemotherapy, or liver transplantation.
<ABS> The review authors found moderate-quality evidence from two trials with low risk of bias (where there was a low risk of a flaw in study design, method of collecting or interpreting results) randomising 578 patients suggesting that hepatic resection yielded better results regarding overall survival (the length of time that the patient remains alive), event-free survival (time that the person remains free of cancer or a certain symptom relating to cancer), and progression (time that the patient lives with cancer without it getting worse) compared with RFA.
<ABS> However, as resection is a more invasive procedure, resection has an eight times higher risk of major complications compared with RFA.
<ABS> Resected patients stayed twice as long in the hospital as the RFA patients.
<ABS> Moderate-quality evidence suggested that RFA prolongs survival and decreases recurrences (where the cancer returns) compared with PEI or PAI.
<ABS> This conclusion was based on data from six randomised clinical trials with 1088 participants.
<ABS> Some patients developed side effects such as fever, rash, and pain.
<ABS> These occurred at the same frequency in both treatment groups.
<ABS> We calculated the number of patients that would be required to judge a relative risk reduction (relative risk is a comparison of the risk of an event happening for one treatment group compared with another treatment group) for survival of 20%.
<ABS> The review authors found that for both comparisons, that is RFA versus PEI or PAI, and RFA versus resection, the number of patients in the included trials was too low to reach valid conclusions.
<ABS> No firm conclusion can be drawn from the comparison of RFA against other interventional techniques or combination approaches.
<ABS> The information provided by the single trials was limited.
<ABS> More randomised clinical trials with low risks of bias (that is low risks of systematic errors, leading to overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) and low risk of play of chance (that is random errors, leading to overestimation or underestimation of benefits and harms) are required.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide.
<INT> RFA competes with other interventional techniques such as percutaneous ethanol injection, surgical resection, and liver transplantation.
<INT> The potential benefits and harms of RFA compared with placebo, no intervention, chemotherapy, hepatic resection, liver transplantation, or other interventions are unclear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science to September 2012.
<MaM> We handsearched meeting abstracts from ASCO, ESMO, AASLD, EASL, APASL, and references of articles.
<MaM> We also contacted researchers in the field (last search September 2012).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed the selection of trials, assessment of risk of bias, and data extraction.
<MaM> We contacted principal investigators for missing information.
<MaM> In addition, we analysed dichotomous survival outcomes using risk ratios (RR).
<MaM> We used trial sequential analysis to control the risk of random errors ('play of chance').

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified no trials comparing RFA versus placebo, no intervention, or liver transplantation.
<RES> We identified and included 11 randomised clinical trials with 1819 participants that included four comparisons: RFA versus hepatic resection (three trials, 578 participants); RFA versus percutaneous ethanol injection (six trials, 1088 participants) including one three-armed trial that also investigated RFA versus acetic acid injection; RFA versus microwave ablation (one trial, 72 participants); and RFA versus laser ablation (one trial, 81 participants).
<RES> Ten of the eleven included trials reported on the primary outcome of this review, overall survival.
<RES> Rates of major complications or procedure-related deaths were reported in 10 trials.
<RES> The overall risk of bias was considered low in five trials and high in six trials.
<RES> For a subgroup analysis, we included only low risk of bias trials.
<RES> Regarding the comparison RFA versus hepatic resection, there was moderate-quality evidence from two low risk of bias trials that hepatic resection seems more effective than RFA regarding overall survival (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78) and two-year survival (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84).
<RES> However, if we included a third trial with high risk of bias, the difference became insignificant (overall survival: HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.15).
<RES> With regards to the outcomes event-free survival and local progression, hepatic resection also yielded better results than RFA.
<RES> However, the number of complications was higher in surgically treated participants (odds ratio (OR) 8.24; 95% CI 2.12 to 31.95).
<RES> RFA seemed superior to percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection regarding overall survival (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.07).
<RES> The RR for mortality was also in favour of RFA, but did not reach statistical significance (150/490 (30.6%) people in the percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid group versus 119/496 (24.0%) people in the RFA group; RR 1.76; 95% CI 0.97 to 3.22).
<RES> The proportion of adverse events did not differ significantly between RFA and percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid injection (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.48).
<RES> Trial sequential analyses revealed that the number of participants in the included trials was insufficient and that more trials are needed to assess the effects of RFA versus other interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The effects of RFA versus no intervention, chemotherapeutic treatment, or liver transplantation are unknown.
<CON> We found moderate-quality evidence that hepatic resection is superior to RFA regarding survival.
<CON> However, RFA might be associated with fewer complications and a shorter hospital stay than hepatic resection.
<CON> We found moderate-quality evidence showing that RFA seems superior to percutaneous ethanol injection regarding survival.
<CON> There were too sparse data to recommend or refute ablation achieved by techniques other than RFA.
<CON> More randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and low risks of random errors assessing the effect of RFA are needed.

<H1> Dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious complication of severe liver disease.
<ABS> The disease is often fluctuating with a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from minor, not readily discernible signs to deep coma.
<ABS> Symptoms often develop in connection to stress related to infection, dehydration, obstipation, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
<ABS> The exact underlying mechanisms behind the disease development are not known.
<ABS> Experimental studies suggest that the mental changes seen in hepatic encephalopathy reflect changes in neurotransmitters in the brain.
<ABS> Dopamine plays a major role in neurotransmission.
<ABS> Several nervous system diseases including Parkinson's disease are caused by a dysfunction in the dopamine system.
<ABS> Some patients with hepatic encephalopathy have symptoms that are similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (slow cerebration; stiffness of movements; tremor).
<ABS> For patients with Parkinson's disease, the drugs known as dopamine agents (drugs that mimic the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine) clearly alleviate symptoms.
<ABS> These drugs have also been assessed for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
<ABS> We performed the present systematic review to determine the beneficial and harmful effects of dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.
<ABS> Our analyses included five small trials published in 1982 or earlier.
<ABS> All trials but one had high risks of bias (i.e., risks of systematic errors or risks of overestimation of beneficial effects or risks of underestimation of harmful effects).
<ABS> Only 144 patients were included in the five trials, and accordingly risks of random errors (i.e., play of chance) are present.
<ABS> Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy or mortality in patients treated with dopamine agents compared with patients who received an inactive placebo or no intervention.
<ABS> The number of patients with adverse events seemed comparable in the two intervention groups.
<ABS> Based on the available evidence, we conclude that no evidence can be found to recommend or refute the use of dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy.
<ABS> More randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials without risks of systematic errors and risks of random errors seem necessary to obtain firm evidence on dopamine agents for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Patients with hepatic encephalopathy may present with extrapyramidal symptoms and changes in basal ganglia.
<INT> These changes are similar to those seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.
<INT> Dopamine agents (such as bromocriptine and levodopa, used for patients with Parkinson's disease) have therefore been assessed as a potential treatment for patients with hepatic encephalopathy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Trials were identified through the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2014), EMBASE (1974 to January 2014), and Science Citation Index-Expanded (1900 to January 2014).
<MaM> Manual searches in reference lists, conference proceedings, and online trial registers were also performed.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised trials were included, irrespective of publication status or language.
<MaM> Paired data from cross-over trials were included in sensitivity analyses.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors extracted data independently.
<MaM> Random-effects meta-analyses were performed as the result of an expected clinical heterogeneity.
<MaM> Fixed-effect meta-analyses, meta-regression analyses, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate sources of heterogeneity and bias (systematic errors).
<MaM> Trial sequential analysis was used to control the risk of play of chance (random errors).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five trials that randomly assigned 144 participants with overt hepatic encephalopathy that were published during 1979 to 1982 were included.
<RES> Three trials assessed levodopa, and two trials assessed bromocriptine.
<RES> The mean daily dose was 4 grams for levodopa and 15 grams for bromocriptine.
<RES> The median duration of treatment was 14 days (range seven to 56 days).
<RES> None of the trials followed participants after the end of treatment.
<RES> Only one trial reported adequate bias control; the remaining four trials were considered to have high risk of bias.
<RES> Random-effects model meta-analyses showed that dopamine agents had no beneficial or detrimental effect on hepatic encephalopathy in the primary analyses (15/80 (19%) versus 14/80 (18%); odds ratio (OR) 2.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 100.55; two trials) or when paired data from cross-over trials were included (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.43).
<RES> Clear evidence of intertrial heterogeneity was identified both in the primary analysis (I2 = 65%) and when paired data from cross-over trials were included (I2 = 40%).
<RES> Dopamine agents had no beneficial or harmful effect on mortality (42/144 (29%) versus 38/144 (26%); OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.54; five trials).
<RES> Trial sequential analyses demonstrated that we lacked information to refute or recommend the interventions for all outcomes.
<RES> Dopamine agonists did not seem to increase the risk of adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review found no evidence to recommend or refute the use of dopamine agents for hepatic encephalopathy.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment of hypertension in peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When blood pressure is consistently high it can lead to complications such as a heart attack (myocardial infarction) or stroke.
<ABS> Both peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a condition that affects the blood vessels (arteries) carrying the blood to the legs, arms, and stomach area, and high blood pressure (hypertension) are associated with atherosclerosis.
<ABS> This is hardening of the arteries which is caused by deposits of fat, cholesterol and other substances inside the blood vessels.
<ABS> PAD is diagnosed when the blood supply to the legs is restricted causing pain and cramping that limits walking (intermittent claudication).
<ABS> It is measured by the walking distance (on a treadmill) before onset of pain (claudication distance) or ankle brachial index (ABI), the ratio of the blood pressure in the arms to the blood pressure in the legs.
<ABS> If the blood pressure is lower in the legs compared to the arms (ABI of less than 1.0) this indicates blocked arteries in the legs (or PAD).
<ABS> PAD can progress to pain at rest and critical limb ischaemia (sudden lack of blood flow to a limb caused by a blood clot or fatty deposit blockage) that requires revascularisation (restoring the blood flow by opening up the blocked blood vessel) or amputation.
<ABS> Treatment of hypertension to reduce cardiovascular events (heart attack or stroke) and death needs careful consideration in people with PAD.
<ABS> Anti-hypertensive medications may worsen the PAD symptoms by further reducing blood flow and supply of oxygen to the limbs, and may have long-term effects on disease progression.
<ABS> The evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the risks and benefits of various anti-hypertensive drugs on measures of PAD is lacking.
<ABS> We identified eight RCTs with a total of 3610 people with symptomatic PAD where participants were randomised to receive an anti-hypertensive treatment for at least one month or placebo or no treatment.
<ABS> Four studies compared an anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other.
<ABS> The studies were not combined due to the variation of comparisons and the outcomes presented.
<ABS> One trial with 1725 participants showed that the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril was effective in reducing the number of cardiovascular events by 28% compared to placebo.
<ABS> In one other study using an ACE inhibitor (n = 52) the perindopril group showed a small increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximal walking distance (MWD).
<ABS> In patients undergoing peripheral arterial angioplasty (a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels) the results from a trial with 96 participants suggested that the calcium channel blocker verapamil reduced restenosis (new blockage of the artery) at six months.
<ABS> In one small study (n = 80) peripheral arterial wall thickness was similar whether men received the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin.
<ABS> In another small study (n = 36) MWD was improved at 12 months in the angiotensin-II receptor antagonist telmisartan group compared to the placebo group but there were no significant differences in ABI or arterial wall thickness.
<ABS> Another study (n = 163) found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, all-cause mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events after 24 weeks of treatment in the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol group and the HCTZ group.
<ABS> A study comparing two beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, nebivolol and metoprolol, found no clear differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, all-cause mortality or revascularisation after 36 weeks of treatment.
<ABS> A subgroup analysis of PAD patients (n = 2699) in the final study revealed no significant differences in the combined endpoints of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke with or without revascularisation between the calcium antagonist-based strategy (verapamil slow release (SR) with or without trandolapril) compared to the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker strategy (atenolol with or without HCTZ).
<ABS> The evidence on the use of various anti-hypertensive drugs in people with PAD is poor so that it is not known whether significant benefits or risks accrue.
<ABS> However, lack of data specifically examining outcomes in hypertensive PAD patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence on the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes considerable morbidity and mortality.
<INT> Hypertension is a risk factor for PAD.
<INT> Treatment for hypertension must be compatible with the symptoms of PAD.
<INT> This is the second update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials had to include patients with symptomatic PAD.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were extracted by one author (DAL) and checked by the other (GYHL).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight RCTs were included with a total of 3610 PAD patients.
<RES> Four studies compared a recognised class of anti-hypertensive treatment with placebo and four studies compared two anti-hypertensive treatments with each other.
<RES> Studies were not pooled due to the variation of the comparisons and the outcomes presented.
<RES> Overall the quality of the available evidence was unclear, primarily as a result of a lack of detail in the study reports on the randomisation and blinding procedures and incomplete outcome data.
<RES> Two studies compared angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors against placebo.
<RES> In one study there was a significant reduction in the number of cardiovascular events in patients receiving ramipril (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.91; n = 1725).
<RES> In the second trial using perindopril (n = 52) there was a marginal increase in claudication distance but no change in ABI and a reduction in maximum walking distance.
<RES> A trial comparing the calcium antagonist verapamil versus placebo in patients undergoing angioplasty (n = 96) suggested that verapamil reduced restenosis (per cent diameter stenosis (± SD) 48.0% ± 11.5 versus 69.6% ± 12.2; P < 0.01), although this was not reflected in the maintenance of a high ABI (0.76 ± 0.10 versus 0.72 ± 0.08 for verapamil versus placebo).
<RES> Another study (n = 80) demonstrated no significant difference in arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) in men receiving the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) compared to those receiving the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker doxazosin (-0.12 ± 0.14 mm and -0.08 ± 0.13 mm, respectively; P = 0.66).
<RES> A study (n = 36) comparing telmisartan to placebo found a significant improvement in maximum walking distance at 12 months with telmisartan (median (interquartile range (IQR)) 191 m (157 to 226) versus 103 m (76 to 164); P < 0.001) but no differences in ABI (median (IQR) 0.60 (0.60 to 0.77) versus 0.52 (0.48 to 0.67)) or arterial IMT (median (IQR) 0.08 cm (0.07 to 0.09) versus 0.09 cm (0.08 to 0.10)).
<RES> Two studies compared the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker nebivolol with either the thiazide diuretic HCTZ or with metoprolol.
<RES> Both studies found no significant differences in intermittent or absolute claudication distance, ABI, or all-cause mortality between the anti-hypertensives.
<RES> A subgroup analysis of PAD patients (n = 2699) in a study which compared a calcium antagonist-based strategy (verapamil slow release (SR) ± trandolapril) to a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker-based strategy (atenolol ± hydrochlorothiazide) found no significant differences in the composite endpoints of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke with or without revascularisation (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07 and OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.13, respectively).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, lack of data specifically examining outcomes in PAD patients should not detract from the overwhelming evidence on the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Haloperidol was first developed in the late 1950s.
<ABS> Research subsequently showed its therapeutic effects on the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices and seeing things (hallucinations), having strange beliefs (delusions), aggressiveness, impulsiveness and states of excitement.
<ABS> This led to the introduction of haloperidol as one of the first antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> Antipsychotic drugs are the main treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia.
<ABS> Despite the introduction of newer antipsychotic drugs (second generation or ‘atypical’ drugs), haloperidol remains in widespread use and is the benchmark for judging the effectiveness of newer antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of haloperidol for schizophrenia and other similar serious mental illnesses compared with ‘dummy’ or no treatment (placebo).
<ABS> A new search for trials was carried out in May 2012 and the review now includes 25 studies with a total of 4651 people.
<ABS> Review authors rated the quality of evidence reported in the trials for seven main outcomes (global state, death, discharge from hospital, relapse, leaving the study early, adverse effects and satisfaction with treatment).
<ABS> For global state, leaving the study early and adverse effects the reviewers rated the evidence as moderate quality, however, relapse and discharge from hospital were rated to be very low quality evidence.
<ABS> There were no data available for death and satisfaction with treatment.
<ABS> Based on moderate quality evidence, haloperidol was found to be better than placebo in treating schizophrenia.
<ABS> More people given haloperidol improved in the first six weeks of treatment than those given placebo.
<ABS> However, a significant number of people on haloperidol suffered from side effects, including muscle stiffness, uncontrollable shaking, tremors, sleepiness and restlessness.
<ABS> Authors concluded that haloperidol is a potent and effective antipsychotic for treating the symptoms of schizophrenia but has the potential to cause debilitating side effects.
<ABS> People with schizophrenia and psychiatrists may wish to prescribe a newer antipsychotic drug with fewer side effects.
<ABS> Finally, a large proportion of other information and data in the trials were poor and badly reported, meaning that better studies are required.
<ABS> Many people, from both groups left the trials early.
<ABS> This suggests that the design and running of the trials was poor and perhaps not acceptable to people.
<ABS> In light of these findings, it is perhaps surprising that haloperidol is a benchmark antipsychotic in widespread use for treating schizophrenia.
<ABS> It is also surprising that haloperidol is widely used as a comparison for new medication.
<ABS> Haloperidol is an effective antipsychotic drug but has serious and debilitating side effects.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Haloperidol was developed in the late 1950s for use in the field of anaesthesia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Initially, we electronically searched the databases of Biological Abstracts (1985-1998), CINAHL (1982-1998), The Cochrane Library (1998, Issue 4), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 1998), EMBASE (1980-1998), MEDLINE (1966-1998), PsycLIT (1974-1998), and SCISEARCH.
<MaM> We also checked references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted the authors of trials and pharmaceutical companies for further information and archive material.
<MaM> For the 2012 update, on 15 May 2012, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Our main outcomes of interest were death, loss to follow-up, clinical and social response, relapse and severity of adverse effects.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We evaluated data independently and extracted, re-inspected and quality assessed the data.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) and calculated their 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD).
<MaM> We excluded continuous data if loss to follow-up was greater than 50% and inspected data for heterogeneity.
<MaM> We used a fixed-effect model for all analyses.
<MaM> For the 2012 update, we assessed risk of bias of included studies and used the GRADE approach to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-five trials randomising 4651 people are now included in this review.
<RES> We chose seven main outcomes of interest for the 'Summary of findings' table.
<RES> More people allocated haloperidol improved in the first six weeks of treatment than those given placebo (4 RCTs n = 472, RR 0.67 CI 0.56 to 0.80, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> A further eight trials also found a difference favouring haloperidol across the six weeks to six months period (8 RCTs n = 307 RR 0.67 CI 0.58 to 0.78, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Relapse data from two trials favoured haloperidol at < 52 weeks but the evidence was very low quality (2 RCTs n = 70, RR 0.69 CI 0.55 to 0.86).
<RES> Adverse effect data does, nevertheless, support clinical impression that haloperidol is a potent cause of movement disorders, at least in the short term.
<RES> Moderate quality evidence indicates that haloperidol caused parkinsonism (5 RCTs n = 485, RR 5.48 CI 2.68 to 11.22), akathisia (6 RCTs n = 695, RR 3.66 CI 2.24 to 5.97, and acute dystonia (5 RCTs n = 471, RR 11.49 CI 3.23 to 10.85).
<RES> Discharge from hospital was equivocal between groups (1 RCT n = 33, RR 0.85 CI 0.47 to 1.52, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Data were not reported for death and patient satisfaction.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Haloperidol is a potent antipsychotic drug but has a high propensity to cause adverse effects.
<CON> Where there is no treatment option, use of haloperidol to counter the damaging and potentially dangerous consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified.
<CON> Haloperidol should be less favoured as a control drug for randomised trials of new antipsychotics.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People who continue to experience asthma symptoms despite regular use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent an asthma management challenge.
<ABS> The addition of a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and the addition of an oral anti-leukotriene (LTRA) are two therapeutic options.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> What is the best add-on treatment in adults and children with asthma whose condition is inadequately controlled with ICS alone: LABA or LTRA?
<ABS> What evidence did we find?
<ABS> From available evidence until December 2012, we found 16 trials involving 6872 adults and two trials involving 336 children contributing to the review.
<ABS> The risk of asthma exacerbations requiring the use of corticosteroids was lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS—from 13% to 11%.
<ABS> The choice of LTRA (montelukast or zafirlukast), the dose of ICS and the age of patients did not significantly affect the results.
<ABS> The effect appeared stronger in trials of short duration and in those using a single device to administer both ICS and LABA.
<ABS> Serious adverse events were more common with LABA than with LTRA, particularly in adults.
<ABS> The combination of LABA + ICS was superior to LTRA + ICS in terms of lung function and was modestly superior in other indicators of the control of asthma and quality of life.
<ABS> LTRA was found superior in preventing deterioration during exercise.
<ABS> The risk of withdrawal from a trial for any reason was significantly lower with LABA than with LTRA.
<ABS> More patients were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS, and fewer changed therapy if they started with LABA instead of LTRA.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> In adults whose asthma is inadequately controlled with ICS, the addition of LABA to ICS was found to be modestly superior to LTRA + ICS.
<ABS> Although both options appeared safe, evidence suggests that slightly more serious adverse events (SAE) may be seen with LABA than with LTRA, particularly when separate devices are used to administer LABA + ICS.
<ABS> Because only two paediatric trials contributed data to the review, the best adjunct strategy to ICS remains uncertain for children.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high in the primary efficacy outcome (i.e. patients with exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids and high to moderate efficacy and safety measures).
<ABS> One open-label study of adult patients with asthma contributed to certain outcomes that led to downgrading of the quality of evidence from high to moderate.
<ABS> Of note, only two paediatric trials contributed to this review.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We specifically wished to examine the relative impact of the two agents on asthma exacerbations, lung function, symptoms, quality of life, adverse health events and withdrawals.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register until December 2012.
<MaM> We consulted reference lists of all included studies and contacted pharmaceutical manufacturers to ask about other published or unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 18 RCTs (7208 participants), of which 16 recruited adults and adolescents (6872) and two recruited children six to 17 years of age (336) with asthma and significant reversibility to bronchodilator at baseline.
<RES> Fourteen (79%) trials were of high methodological quality.
<RES> The risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (primary outcome of the review) was significantly lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS—from 13% to 11% (eight studies, 5923 adults and 334 children; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.99; high-quality evidence).
<RES> The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with LABA compared with LTRA to prevent one additional exacerbation over four to 102 weeks was 62 (95% CI 34 to 794).
<RES> The choice of LTRA, the dose of ICS and the participants' age group did not significantly influence the magnitude of effect.
<RES> Although results were inconclusive, the effect appeared stronger in trials that used a single device rather than two devices to administer ICS and LABA and in trials of less than 12 weeks' duration.
<RES> The addition of LABA to ICS was associated with a statistically greater improvement from baseline in lung function, as well as in symptoms, rescue medication use and quality of life, although the latter effects were modest.
<RES> LTRA was superior in the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.
<RES> More participants were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS than LTRA + ICS (three studies, 1625 adults; RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> The overall risk of withdrawal was significantly lower with LABA + ICS than with LTRA + ICS (13 studies, 6652 adults and 308 children; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Although the risk of overall adverse events was equivalent between the two groups, the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) approached statistical significance in disfavour of LABA compared with LTRA (nine studies, 5658 adults and 630 children; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.79; P value 0.06; moderate-quality evidence), with no apparent impact of participants' age group.
<RES> The following adverse events were reported, but no significant differences were demonstrated between groups: headache (11 studies, N = 6538); cardiovascular events (five studies, N = 5163), osteopenia and osteoporosis (two studies, N = 2963), adverse events (10 studies, N = 5977 adults and 300 children).
<RES> A significant difference in the risk of oral moniliasis was noted, but this represents a low occurrence rate.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In adults with asthma that is inadequately controlled by predominantly low-dose ICS with significant bronchodilator reversibility, the addition of LABA to ICS is modestly superior to the addition of LTRA in reducing oral corticosteroid–treated exacerbations, with an absolute reduction of two percentage points.
<CON> Differences favouring LABA over LTRA as adjunct therapy were observed in lung function and, to a lesser extend, in rescue medication use, symptoms and quality of life.
<CON> The lower overall withdrawal rate and the higher proportion of participants satisfied with their therapy indirectly favour the combination of LABA + ICS over LTRA + ICS.
<CON> Evidence showed a slightly increased risk of SAE with LABA compared with LTRA, with an absolute increase of one percentage point.
<CON> Our findings modestly support the use of a single inhaler for the delivery of both LABA and low- or medium-dose ICS.
<CON> Because of the paucity of paediatric trials, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the best adjunct therapy in children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In sickle cell disease there are fewer red blood cells.
<ABS> This means less oxygen is carried to tissues and there are problems throughout the body.
<ABS> Sickled red blood cells can block flow in blood vessels in the brain, leading to strokes.
<ABS> We aimed to compare long-term blood transfusion schedules to other transfusion schedules or other ways of preventing stroke.
<ABS> There are three trials in the review.
<ABS> The results of the STOP and STOP 2 trials showed that regular blood transfusions reduce the risk of stroke significantly in those at high risk (determined by ultrasound screening of blood flow in the brain), but that patients returned to having a high risk for stroke when transfusions were stopped.
<ABS> There are important side effects (iron overload, infection transmitted through blood and reactions to the transfusions).
<ABS> When using this treatment the burden of long-term transfusion should be weighed against the degree of risk of stroke.
<ABS> The third trial showed that there is no evidence of an advantage for the combination of hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (removing blood from the body) compared with standard transfusion and iron "chelation" treatment in preventing stroke and iron overload.
<ABS> Current research is evaluating the use of transfusion to prevent 'silent' strokes and hydroxyurea to replace transfusion in those with abnormal ultrasound examinations.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In sickle cell disease, a common inherited haemoglobin disorder, abnormal haemoglobin distorts red blood cells, causing anaemia, vaso-occlusion and dysfunction in most body organs.
<INT> Without intervention, stroke affects around 10% of children with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS) and recurrence is likely.
<INT> Chronic blood transfusion dilutes the sickled red blood cells, reducing the risk of vaso-occlusion and stroke.
<INT> However, side effects can be severe.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of the latest search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 28 January 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Searches identified three eligible randomised trials (n = 342).
<RES> The first two trials addressed the use of chronic transfusion to prevent primary stroke; the third utilized the drug hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) and phlebotomy to prevent both recurrent (secondary) stroke and iron overload in patients who had already experienced an initial stroke.
<RES> In the first trial (STOP) a chronic transfusion regimen for maintaining sickle haemoglobin lower than 30% was compared with standard care in 130 children with sickle cell disease judged (through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography) as high-risk for first stroke.
<RES> During the trial, 11 children in the standard care group suffered a stroke compared to one in the transfusion group, odds ratio 0.08 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.66).
<RES> This meant the trial was terminated early.
<RES> The transfusion group had a high complications rate, including iron overload, alloimmunisation, and transfusion reactions.
<RES> The second trial (STOP II) investigated risk of stroke when transfusion was stopped after at least 30 months in this population.
<RES> The trial closed early due to a significant difference in risk of stroke between participants who stopped transfusion and those who continued as measured by reoccurrence of abnormal velocities on Doppler examination or the occurrence of overt stroke in the group that stopped transfusion.
<RES> The third trial (SWiTCH) was a non-inferiority trial comparing transfusion and iron chelation (standard management) with hydroxyurea and phlebotomy (alternative treatment) with the combination endpoint of prevention of stroke recurrence and reduction of iron overload.
<RES> This trial was stopped early after enrolment and follow up of 133 children because of analysis showing futility in reaching the composite primary endpoint.
<RES> The stroke rate (seven strokes on hydroxyurea and phlebotomy, none on transfusion and chelation, odds ratio 16.49 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 294.84)) was within the non-inferiority margin, but the liver iron content was not better in the alternative arm.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The STOP trial demonstrated a significantly reduced risk of stroke in participants with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities receiving regular blood transfusions.
<CON> The degree of risk must be balanced against the burden of chronic transfusions.
<CON> The combination of hydroxyurea and phlebotomy is not as effective as "standard" transfusion and chelation in preventing secondary stroke and iron overload.
<CON> Ongoing multicentre trials are investigating the use of chronic transfusion to prevent silent infarcts, the use of hydroxyurea as an alternative to transfusion in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities, and the use of hydroxyurea to prevent conversion of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography velocities from conditional (borderline) to abnormal values.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that damages many of the body's organs and can shorten a person's life span.
<ABS> The disease is progressive, stressful to manage, and needs complex and time-consuming treatments, leaving patients and caregivers stressed due to the challenges of the treatment.
<ABS> Thus, individuals with cystic fibrosis and their family members often need help to cope better and to deal with their thoughts and feelings.
<ABS> They also need assistance in managing the demands of the prescribed treatment schedules.
<ABS> In addition, infection control guidelines recommend the isolation of people with cystic fibrosis from others with the same disease, leading to a lack of peer support and potential social isolation.
<ABS> We looked for studies of psychological treatments in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their families which aimed to reduce anxiety and depression, to improve adjustment, quality of life, and even medical outcomes, as well as knowledge, skills, and decisions regarding care.
<ABS> The review includes 16 studies with a total of 556 participants.
<ABS> Even though there many different psychological interventions, only a few have been evaluated for individuals with CF and their families.
<ABS> Due to the lack of high quality studies, it is not possible to currently show which psychological treatments are most helpful to those with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.
<ABS> Five out of the 16 studies we found evaluated behavioural interventions to improve dietary intake.
<ABS> We found that in children aged 4 to 12 years receiving a nutritional intervention plus behavioural management training, consumed about 276 per day more than children just receiving the nutritional intervention.
<ABS> We also found that a structured decision-making tool for adults considering lung transplantation improved their knowledge, assisted in setting realistic expectations, and reduced indecision.
<ABS> In summary, there is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting specific illness-related symptoms and behaviours can work.
<ABS> More studies on psychological interventions with more people are urgently needed.
<ABS> There are several ongoing randomised controlled studies aimed at improving adherence to prescribed treatments, but final results are not yet available.
<ABS> We recommend multicentre studies to provide evidence for which interventions are most effective for the key issues faced by people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> With increasing survival estimates for individuals with cystic fibrosis, long-term management has become an important focus.
<INT> Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adaptation and health-related quality of life.
<INT> We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's register: 19 December 2013.
<MaM> Most recent search of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's register: 12 November 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled studies of a broad range of psychological interventions evaluating subjective and objective health outcomes, such as quality of life or pulmonary function, in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their immediate family.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review includes 16 studies (eight new studies included in this update) representing data from 556 participants.
<RES> Studies are diverse in their design and their methods.
<RES> They cover interventions with generic approaches, as well as interventions developed specifically to target disease-specific symptoms and problems in people with cystic fibrosis.
<RES> These include cognitive behavioural interventions to improve adherence to nutrition or psychosocial adjustment, cognitive interventions to improve adherence or those associated with decision making in lung transplantation, a community-based support intervention and other interventions, such as self-hypnosis, respiratory muscle biofeedback, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, and a tele-medicine intervention to support patients awaiting transplantation.
<RES> A substantial proportion of outcomes relate to adherence, changes in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease.
<RES> There is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting nutrition and growth in children (4 to 12 years) with cystic fibrosis are effective in the short term.
<RES> Evidence was found that providing a structured decision-making tool for patients considering lung transplantation improves patients' knowledge of and expectations about the transplant, and reduces decisional conflict in the short term.
<RES> One study about training in biofeedback-assisted breathing demonstrated some evidence that it improved some lung function measurements.
<RES> Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, insufficient evidence exists on psychological interventions or approaches to support people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers, although some of the studies were promising.
<CON> Due to the heterogeneity between studies, more of each type of intervention are needed to support preliminary evidence.
<CON> Multicentre studies, with consequent funding implications, are needed to increase the sample size of these studies and enhance the statistical power and precision to detect important findings.
<CON> In addition, multicentre studies could improve the generalisation of results by minimizing centre or therapist effects.
<CON> Psychological interventions should be targeted to illness-specific symptoms or behaviours to demonstrate efficacy.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Aromatherapy for dementia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Aromatherapy is the use of pure essential oils from fragrant plants (such as peppermint, sweet marjoram, and rose) to help relieve health problems and improve the quality of life in general.
<ABS> The healing properties of aromatherapy are claimed to include promotion of relaxation and sleep, relief of pain, and reduction of depressive symptoms.
<ABS> Hence, aromatherapy has been used to reduce disturbed behaviour, to promote sleep, and to stimulate motivational behaviour of people with dementia.
<ABS> Of the seven randomised controlled trials that we found, only two trials including 186 people had useable data.
<ABS> The analysis of these two small trials showed inconsistent effects of aromatherapy on measures of agitation, behavioural symptoms and quality of life.
<ABS> More large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before firm conclusions can be reached about the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Complementary therapy has received great interest within the field of dementia treatment and the use of aromatherapy and essential oils is increasing.
<INT> In a growing population where the majority of patients are treated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, the efficacy of treatment is short term and accompanied by negative side effects.
<INT> Utilisation of complimentary therapies in dementia care settings presents as one of few options that are attractive to practitioners and families as patients often have reduced insight and ability to verbally communicate adverse reactions.
<INT> Amongst the most distressing features of dementia are the behavioural and psychological symptoms.
<INT> Addressing this facet has received particular interest in aromatherapy trials, with a shift in focus from reducing cognitive dysfunction to the reduction of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All relevant randomised controlled trials were considered.
<MaM> A minimum length of a trial and requirements for follow-up were not included, and participants in included studies had a diagnosis of dementia of any type and severity.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Titles and abstracts extracted by the searches were screened for their eligibility for potential inclusion in the review.
<MaM> For Burns 2011, continuous outcomes were estimated as the mean difference between groups and its 95% confidence interval using a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> For Ballard 2002, analysis of co-variance was used for all outcomes, with the nursing home being treated as a random effect.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies with 428 participants were included in this review; only two of these had published usable results.
<RES> Individual patient data were obtained from one trial (Ballard 2002) and additional analyses performed.
<RES> The additional analyses conducted using individual patient data from Ballard 2002 revealed a statistically significant treatment effect in favour of the aromatherapy intervention on measures of agitation (n = 71, MD -11.1, 95% CI -19.9 to -2.2) and behavioural symptoms (n = 71, MD -15.8, 95% CI -24.4 to -7.2).
<RES> Burns 2011, however, found no difference in agitation (n = 63, MD 0.00, 95% CI -1.36 to 1.36), behavioural symptoms (n = 63, MD 2.80, 95% CI -5.84 to 11.44), activities of daily living (n = 63, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.79) and quality of life (n = 63, MD 19.00, 95% CI -23.12 to 61.12).
<RES> Burns 2011 and Fu 2013 found no difference in adverse effects (n = 124, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.46) when aromatherapy was compared to placebo.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The benefits of aromatherapy for people with dementia are equivocal from the seven trials included in this review.
<CON> It is important to note there were several methodological difficulties with the included studies.
<CON> More well-designed, large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of aromatherapy for dementia.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Urodynamic studies (tests) for the management of urinary incontinence in children and adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Urinary incontinence is defined as the involuntary loss of urine and is the inability to retain urine in the bladder between voluntary acts of urination.
<ABS> It has a number of different causes.
<ABS> This might improve the success of the treatment.
<ABS> Eight trials were found, which included around 1100 people, although information was only available for 1036 women.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence to determine whether the urodynamic tests led to better outcomes.
<ABS> There was some evidence that urodynamic testing increased the number of people given drugs but not the number of people undergoing surgery.
<ABS> This did not result in any difference in the number of people who leaked urine, and it was not known whether they had a better quality of life.
<ABS> More research is needed in which people are randomised to having treatment decisions based on either their symptoms and examination alone or after taking into account the extra information provided by urodynamic tests.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The aim is to help select the treatment most likely to be successful.
<INT> The investigations are invasive and time consuming.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The objective of this review was to determine if treatment according to a urodynamic-based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of people with urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes.
<OBJ> The intention was to test the following hypotheses in predefined subgroups of people with incontinence:(i) urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes;
<OBJ> (ii) urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making;
<OBJ> (iii) one type of urodynamic test is better than another in improving the outcomes of management of incontinence or influencing clinical decisions, or both.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight trials involving around 1100 people were included but data were only available for 1036 women in seven trials, of whom 526 received urodynamics.
<RES> There was some evidence of risk of bias.
<RES> The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained.
<RES> There was significant evidence that the tests did change clinical decision making.
<RES> Women in the urodynamic arms of three trials were more likely to have their management changed (proportion with change in management compared with the control arm 17% versus 3%, risk ratio (RR) 5.07, 95% CI 1.87 to 13.74), although there was statistical heterogeneity.
<RES> There was evidence from two trials that women treated after urodynamic investigations were more likely to receive drugs (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.31).
<RES> On the other hand, in five trials women undergoing treatment following urodynamic investigation were not more likely to undergo surgery (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference however in the number of women with urinary incontinence if they received treatment guided by urodynamics (37%) compared with those whose treatment was based on history and clinical findings alone (36%) (for example, RR for the number with incontinence after the first year 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21).
<RES> It was calculated that the number of women needed to treat was 100 women (95% CI 86 to 114 women) undergoing urodynamics to prevent one extra individual being incontinent at one year.
<RES> One trial reported adverse effects and no significant difference was found (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was no evidence about their use in men, children, or people with neurological diseases.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> BackgroundPressure ulcers (also called bed sores) are wounds caused by pressure at the weight-bearing, bony points of immobilised people (such as hips, heels and elbows).
<ABS> Poor nutritional status, or dehydration, may weaken the skin and make people more vulnerable to developing pressure ulcers.
<ABS> Once a pressure ulcer has developed, it can become very large and difficult to heal.
<ABS> Review QuestionWe wanted to find out whether changing the diet (for example by giving supplements) could prevent the development of pressure ulcers.
<ABS> We also wanted to find out if dietary changes could help heal pressure ulcers that had already occurred.
<ABS> The review of trials found that there is no clear evidence that nutritional interventions reduce the number of people who develop pressure ulcers or help the healing of existing pressure ulcers.
<ABS> More research is needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pressure ulcers affect approximately 10% of people in hospitals and older people are at highest risk.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> No date, language or publication status limits were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of enteral or parenteral nutrition on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers, which measured the incidence of new ulcers, ulcer healing or changes in pressure ulcer severity.
<MaM> There were no restrictions on types of patient, setting, date, publication status or language.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 23 RCTs, many were small (between 9 and 4023 participants, median 88) and at high risk of bias.
<RES> Eleven trials compared a combination of nutritional supplements, consisting of a minimum of energy and protein in different dosages, for the prevention of pressure ulcers.
<RES> A meta-analysis of eight trials (6062 participants) that compared the effects of mixed nutritional supplements with standard hospital diet found no clear evidence of an effect of supplementation on pressure ulcer development (pooled RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; P value 0.05; I2 = 13%, random effects).
<RES> This outcome is at unclear or high risk of bias.
<RES> Fourteen trials evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements on the healing of existing pressure ulcers: seven trials examined mixed nutritional supplements, three the effects of proteins, two trials examined zinc, and two studies examined ascorbic acid.
<RES> The included trials were heterogeneous with regard to participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes and meta-analysis was not appropriate.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of an improvement in pressure ulcer healing from the nutritional supplements evaluated in any of these individual studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently no clear evidence of a benefit associated with nutritional interventions for either the prevention or treatment of pressure ulcers.
<CON> Further trials of high methodological quality are necessary.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment for primary postpartum haemorrhage

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatment for excessive bleeding after childbirth

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> After a woman gives birth, womb muscles contract, clamping down on the blood vessels and helping to limit bleeding when the placenta has detached.
<ABS> If the muscles do not contract strongly enough, very heavy bleeding (postpartum haemorrhage) can occur, which can be life threatening.
<ABS> These situations are common in resource-poor countries, and maternal mortality is about 100 times higher than in resource-rich countries.
<ABS> It is a very serious problem that requires effective treatments that might avoid the use of surgery to remove the womb (hysterectomy).
<ABS> This is often the last treatment option and leaves the woman unable to have more children.
<ABS> In most settings, women are given a drug at the time of birth (before excessive bleeding occurs) to reduce the likelihood of excessive blood loss.
<ABS> However, despite this intervention, some women bleed excessively, and this review looked to see what interventions might be used to reduce the amount of blood lost by these women.
<ABS> Treatment options include drugs to increase muscles contractions (such as oxytocin, ergometrine and prostaglandins like misoprostol), drugs to help with blood clotting (haemostatic drugs such as tranexamic acid and recombinant activated factor VII), surgical techniques (such as tying off or blocking of the uterine artery) and radiological interventions (to assist in blocking the main artery to the womb by using gel foams).
<ABS> The review identified 10 randomised controlled trials involving 4052 women.
<ABS> Seven of these trials looked at a drug called misoprostol, which is a prostaglandin and so works by increasing muscle contractions.
<ABS> Overall, the trials suggest that misoprostol does not work as well as oxytocin infusion, and it has more side effects.
<ABS> However, oxytocin needs to be kept in a refrigerator, and so in settings where refrigeration and infusions are not readily available, misoprostol can be used.
<ABS> Other clinical trials looked into using other types of drugs or squeezing the main artery that supplies blood to the woman.
<ABS> The number of women included in these studies was too small for any useful conclusions regarding their effectiveness and safety.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We assessed studies for eligibility and quality and extracted data independently.
<MaM> We contacted authors of the included studies to request more information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a total of 4052 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in this review.
<RES> Four RCTs (1881 participants) compared misoprostol with placebo given in addition to conventional uterotonics.
<RES> Adjunctive use of misoprostol (in the dose of 600 to 1000 mcg) with simultaneous administration of additional uterotonics did not provide additional benefit for our primary outcomes including maternal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 6.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 50.85), serious maternal morbidity (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.31), admission to intensive care (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.11) or hysterectomy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.16 to 5.41).
<RES> Two RCTs (1787 participants) compared 800 mcg sublingual misoprostol versus oxytocin infusion as primary PPH treatment; one trial included women who had received prophylactic uterotonics, and the other did not.
<RES> Primary outcomes did not differ between the two groups, although women given sublingual misoprostol were more likely to have additional blood loss of at least 1000 mL (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.04 to 6.75).
<RES> Misoprostol was associated with a significant increase in vomiting and shivering.
<RES> Two trials attempted to test the effectiveness of estrogen and tranexamic acid, respectively, but were too small for any meaningful comparisons of pre-specified outcomes.
<RES> One study compared lower segment compression but was too small to assess impact on primary outcomes.
<RES> We did not identify any trials evaluating surgical techniques or radiological interventions for women with primary PPH unresponsive to uterotonics and/or haemostatics.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Clinical trials included in the current review were not adequately powered to assess impact on the primary outcome measures.
<CON> Compared with misoprostol, oxytocin infusion is more effective and causes fewer side effects when used as first-line therapy for the treatment of primary PPH.
<CON> When used after prophylactic uterotonics, misoprostol and oxytocin infusion worked similarly.
<CON> The review suggests that among women who received oxytocin for the treatment of primary PPH, adjunctive use of misoprostol confers no added benefit.
<CON> The role of tranexamic acid and compression methods requires further evaluation.
<CON> Furthermore, future studies should focus on the best way to treat women who fail to respond to uterotonic therapy.

<H1> Physical fitness training for stroke patients

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Physical fitness training for stroke patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Physical fitness is important to allow people to carry out everyday activities such as walking and climbing stairs.
<ABS> However, physical fitness is often reduced in stroke patients and may limit their ability to perform everyday activities and also worsen any stroke-related disability.
<ABS> For this reason fitness training has been proposed as a beneficial approach for stroke patients.
<ABS> In January 2013 this review identified 45 trials involving 2188 participants, which tested different forms of fitness training after stroke.
<ABS> Studies of fitness training can be difficult to carry out.
<ABS> This means most of the studies were small and of moderate quality.
<ABS> However, some consistent findings did emerge.
<ABS> We found that some types of fitness training, particularly those involving walking, can improve exercise ability, walking and balance after stroke.
<ABS> However, there was not enough information to draw reliable conclusions about the impact of fitness training on quality of life or mood.
<ABS> There was no evidence that any of the different types of fitness training caused injuries or other health problems; exercise appears to be a safe intervention.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Levels of physical fitness are low after stroke.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether fitness training after stroke reduces death, dependence, and disability.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12: searched January 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2013), EMBASE (1980 to January 2013), CINAHL (1982 to January 2013), SPORTDiscus (1949 to January 2013), and five additional databases (January 2013).
<MaM> We also searched ongoing trials registers, handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists, and contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> We analysed data using random-effects meta-analyses.
<MaM> Diverse outcome measures limited the intended analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 45 trials, involving 2188 participants, which comprised cardiorespiratory (22 trials, 995 participants), resistance (eight trials, 275 participants), and mixed training interventions (15 trials, 918 participants).
<RES> Nine deaths occurred before the end of the intervention and a further seven at the end of follow-up.
<RES> No dependence data were reported.
<RES> Diverse outcome measures made data pooling difficult.
<RES> Global indices of disability show a tendency to improve after cardiorespiratory training (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 0.64; P = 0.007); benefits at follow-up and after mixed training were unclear.
<RES> There were insufficient data to assess the effects of resistance training.
<RES> Cardiorespiratory training involving walking improved maximum walking speed (mean difference (MD) 7.37 metres per minute, 95% CI 3.70 to 11.03), preferred gait speed (MD 4.63 metres per minute, 95% CI 1.84 to 7.43), walking capacity (MD 26.99 metres per six minutes, 95% CI 9.13 to 44.84), and Berg Balance scores (MD 3.14, 95% CI 0.56 to 5.73) at the end of the intervention.
<RES> Mixed training, involving walking, increased preferred walking speed (MD 4.54 metres per minute, 95% CI 0.95 to 8.14), walking capacity (MD 41.60 metres per six minutes, 95% CI 25.25 to 57.95), and also pooled balance scores but the evidence is weaker (SMD 0.26 95% CI 0.04 to, 0.49).
<RES> Some mobility benefits also persisted at the end of follow-up.
<RES> The variability and trial quality hampered the assessment of the reliability and generalisability of the observed results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The effects of training on death and dependence after stroke are unclear.
<CON> Cardiorespiratory training reduces disability after stroke and this may be mediated by improved mobility and balance.
<CON> There is sufficient evidence to incorporate cardiorespiratory and mixed training, involving walking, within post-stroke rehabilitation programs to improve the speed and tolerance of walking; improvement in balance may also occur.
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to support the use of resistance training.
<CON> Further well-designed trials are needed to determine the optimal content of the exercise prescription and identify long-term benefits.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Gallstones are a common problem in the general population and commonly cause problems with pain (biliary colic) and gallbladder infections (acute cholecystitis).
<ABS> Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder and become trapped in the tube between the gallbladder and the small bowel (common bile duct).
<ABS> Here, they obstruct the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel and cause pain, jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the eyes, dark urine, and pale stools), and sometimes severe infections of the bile (cholangitis).
<ABS> Between 10% and 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones.
<ABS> Treatment involves removal of the gallbladder as well as the gallstones from this tube.
<ABS> There are several methods to achieve this.
<ABS> Surgery is performed to remove the gallbladder.
<ABS> In the past, this was performed through a single large incision through the abdomen (open cholecystectomy).
<ABS> Newer keyhole techniques (laparoscopic surgery) are now the most common methods of removal of the gallbladder.
<ABS> Removal of the trapped gallstones in the common bile duct can be performed at the same time as the open or keyhole surgery.
<ABS> Alternatively, an endoscope (a narrow flexible tube equipped with a camera) is inserted through the mouth and into the small bowel to allow removal of the trapped gallstones from the common bile duct.
<ABS> This procedure can be performed before, during, and after the surgery to remove the gallbladder.
<ABS> This systematic review attempts to answer the question of the safest and most effective method to remove these trapped gallstones (in terms of open surgery or laparoscopic surgery compared with endoscopic removal), whether removal of the common bile duct stones should be performed during surgery to remove the gallbladder as a single-stage treatment or as a separate treatment before or after surgery (two-stage treatment).
<ABS> All the trials were at high risk of bias (defects in study design which may result in overestimation of benefits or underestimation of harms).
<ABS> Overall the quality of the evidence is moderate because of the risk of systematic errors or bias (defects in study design) and random errors (insufficient number of participants were included in the trials) which can result in wrong conclusions.
<ABS> Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery to remove the gallbladder and trapped gallstones appears to be as safe as and as effective as the endoscopic technique.
<ABS> More randomised clinical trials conducted with low risks of systematic errors (trials) and low risks of random errors (play of chances) are required to confirm or refute the present findings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Between 10% to 18% of people undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones have common bile duct stones.
<INT> The benefits and harms of the different approaches are not known.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated the odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models meta-analyses, performed with Review Manager 5.

<RES> ABS RESULTS

<CON> More randomised clinical trials without risks of systematic and random errors are necessary to confirm these findings.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Exercise-based rehabilitation for heart failure

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Exercise-based rehabilitation for heart failure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People with heart failure experience marked reductions in their exercise capacity, which has detrimental effects on their activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and ultimately their hospital admission rate and mortality.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the scientific literature for randomised controlled trials (experiments in which two or more interventions, possibly including a control intervention or no intervention, are compared by being randomly allocated to participants) looking at the effectiveness of exercise-based treatments compared with no exercise on heart failure in adults over 18 years of age.
<ABS> The inclusion criteria of this updated review were extended to consider not only HF due to reduced ejection fraction (HFREF or 'systolic HF') (ejection fraction is a measure of how well your heart is pumping), but also HF due to preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF or 'diastolic HF').
<ABS> The search is current to January 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 33 RCTs that included 4740 participants.
<ABS> The findings of this update are consistent with the previous (2010) version of this Cochrane review and show important benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation that include a reduction in the risk of hospital admissions due to HF and improvements in health-related quality of life compared with not undertaking exercise.
<ABS> There was a high level of variation across studies in health-related quality of life outcome.
<ABS> While the majority of evidence was for exercise-based rehabilitation in people with HFREF, this update did identify a broader evidence base that included higher risk (New York Heart Association class IV) and older people, people with HFPEF and more programmes conducted in a home-based setting.
<ABS> We found no evidence to suggest that exercise training programmes cause harm in terms of an increase in the risk of death in either the short or longer term.
<ABS> A small body of economic evidence was identified indicating exercise-based rehabilitation to be cost-effective.
<ABS> Further evidence is needed to understand the effect of exercise training in people with HFPEF better and the costs and effects of exclusively home-based exercise rehabilitation programmes.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The general lack of reporting of methods in the included trial reports made it difficult to assess their methodological quality and thereby judge their risk of possible bias.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane systematic review previously published in 2010.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation on the mortality, hospitalisation admissions, morbidity and health-related quality of life for people with HF.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We updated searches from the previous Cochrane review.
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue1, 2013) from January 2008 to January 2013.
<MaM> We also searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO (Ovid) (January 2008 to January 2013).
<MaM> We handsearched Web of Science, bibliographies of systematic reviews and trial registers (Controlled-trials.com and Clinicaltrials.gov).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of exercise-based interventions with six months' follow-up or longer compared with a no exercise control that could include usual medical care.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened all identified references and rejected those that were clearly ineligible.
<MaM> We obtained full-text papers of potentially relevant trials.
<MaM> One review author independently extracted data from the included trials and assessed their risk of bias; a second review author checked data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 33 trials with 4740 people with HF predominantly with HFREF and New York Heart Association classes II and III.
<RES> This latest update identified a further 14 trials.
<RES> The overall risk of bias of included trials was moderate.
<RES> There was no difference in pooled mortality between exercise-based rehabilitation versus no exercise control in trials with up to one-year follow-up (25 trials, 1871 participants: risk ratio (RR) 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.27, fixed-effect analysis).
<RES> However, there was trend towards a reduction in mortality with exercise in trials with more than one year of follow-up (6 trials, 2845 participants: RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.02, fixed-effect analysis).
<RES> Compared with control, exercise training reduced the rate of overall (15 trials, 1328 participants: RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92, fixed-effect analysis) and HF specific hospitalisation (12 trials, 1036 participants: RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80, fixed-effect analysis).
<RES> Exercise also resulted in a clinically important improvement superior in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (13 trials, 1270 participants: mean difference: -5.8 points; 95% CI -9.2 to -2.4, random-effects analysis) - a disease specific health-related quality of life measure.
<RES> However, levels of statistical heterogeneity across studies in this outcome were substantial.
<RES> Univariate meta-regression analysis showed that these benefits were independent of the participant's age, gender, degree of left ventricular dysfunction, type of cardiac rehabilitation (exercise only vs. comprehensive rehabilitation), mean dose of exercise intervention, length of follow-up, overall risk of bias and trial publication date.
<RES> Within these included studies, a small body of evidence supported exercise-based rehabilitation for HFPEF (three trials, undefined participant number) and when exclusively delivered in a home-based setting (5 trials, 521 participants).
<RES> One study reported an additional mean healthcare cost in the training group compared with control of USD3227/person.
<RES> Two studies indicated exercise-based rehabilitation to be a potentially cost-effective use of resources in terms of gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years saved.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the small body of evidence seen in this review for the benefit of exercise in HFPEF and when exercise rehabilitation is exclusively delivered in a home-based setting.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There is some evidence that manual fetal manipulation of unborn babies make tests of their wellbeing more effective.
<ABS> Tests on unborn babies such as ultrasound and heart rate testing are carried out to check their wellbeing.
<ABS> As a baby's sleep periods can alter those results, various methods are used to wake the baby.
<ABS> Manual fetal manipulation is one of the methods.
<ABS> The review of trials suggests that this method could improve the efficiency of antepartum fetal heart rate testing.
<ABS> Research on manual fetal manipulation should take into consideration the different stimulation protocols.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted authors of published and unpublished trials for further information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials with a total of 1280 women with 2670 episodes of participation.
<RES> No trial was at low risk of bias for all domains and only two trials were at low risk of bias for both selection and attrition bias.
<RES> Fetal manual manipulation decreased the incidence of non-reactive antenatal cardiotocography test compared to mock or no stimulation.
<RES> However, this was not statistically significant (average risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 6.20, I² = 96%; two trials, N = 2350).
<RES> There was also no significant reduction in the mean testing time to achieve a reactive result (mean difference -2.29 minutes, 95% CI -9.61 minutes to 5.03 minutes, I² = 97%; two trials, N = 560).
<RES> Comparing fetal manual manipulation with vibroacoustic stimulation, there was no significant difference in the incidence of non-reactive cardiotocography or the need for contraction-stress test.
<RES> There were no data available on other outcomes such as perinatal mortality, fetal distress, maternal anxiety and gestation at delivery.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to support the use of manual fetal manipulation during cardiotocography or other tests of fetal wellbeing.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question:
<ABS> How many embryos should be transferred in couples undergoing ART?
<ABS> Background:
<ABS> Multiple pregnancy creates serious health risks for the mother (such as premature labour, diabetes and high blood pressure) and for the babies, who are at much higher risk than single babies of problems including premature birth, low birth weight, cerebral palsy and perinatal death.
<ABS> Single embryo transfer is now being seriously considered in order to reduce multiple pregnancies but this needs to be balanced against the risk of lowering the overall live birth rate.
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration reviewed the evidence about the number of embryos transferred in women undergoing ART.
<ABS> The search is current to July 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics:
<ABS> We found 14 randomised controlled trials with a total of 2165 participants.
<ABS> Most were not commercially funded.
<ABS> Key findings:
<ABS> Double versus repeated single embryo transfer
<ABS> Based on low quality evidence, there was no indication that overall live birth rates differed substantially when repeated single embryo transfer (either two cycles of single embryo transfer or one cycle of single embryo transfer followed by transfer of a single frozen embryo in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle) was compared with double embryo transfer.
<ABS> The evidence suggested that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following repeated single embryo transfer would be between 31% and 44%.
<ABS> The risk of multiple birth was very much lower in the single embryo transfer group: for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the estimated risk following a repeated single transfer was between 0% and 2%.
<ABS> Double versus single embryo transfer
<ABS> We found high quality evidence that the chances of live birth were lower after one cycle of fresh single embryo transfer than after one cycle of fresh double embryo transfer.
<ABS> For a woman with a 45% chance of live birth following a single cycle of double embryo transfer, the chance following a single cycle of single embryo transfer was between 24% and 33%.
<ABS> However, the risk of twins was about seven times higher after double embryo transfer.
<ABS> Conclusion:
<ABS> Repeated single embryo transfer appears the best option for most women undergoing ART.
<ABS> Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Multiple embryo transfer during in vitro fertilisation (IVF) increases multiple pregnancy rates causing maternal and perinatal morbidity.
<INT> Single embryo transfer is now being seriously considered as a means of minimising the risk of multiple pregnancy.
<INT> However, this needs to be balanced against the risk of jeopardising the overall live birth rate.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception to July 2013.
<MaM> We handsearched reference lists of articles, trial registers and relevant conference proceedings and contacted researchers in the field.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different policies for the number of embryos transferred following IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in subfertile women.
<MaM> Studies of fresh or frozen and thawed transfer of one, two, three or four embryos at cleavage or blastocyst stage were eligible.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence was graded in a summary of findings table.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen RCTs were included in the review (2165 women).
<RES> Thirteen compared cleavage-stage transfers (2017 women) and two compared blastocyst transfers (148 women): one study compared both.
<RES> No studies compared repeated single versus repeated multiple embryo transfer (SET).
<RES> Repeated SET versus DET
<RES> Repeated SET was compared with DET in three studies of cleavage-stage transfer.
<RES> In these studies the SET group received either two cycles of fresh SET (one study) or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one frozen SET in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle (two studies).
<RES> When these three studies were pooled, the cumulative live birth rate after repeated SET was not significantly different from the rate after one cycle of DET (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, three studies, n=811, I2=0%, low quality evidence).
<RES> This suggests that for a woman with a 42% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following repeated SET would be between 31% and 44%.
<RES> The multiple pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.13, three RCTs, n = 811, I2 = 23%, low quality evidence), suggesting that for a woman with a 13% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following repeated SET would be between 0% and 2%.
<RES> Single-cycle SET versus single-cycle DET
<RES> A single cycle of SET was compared with a single cycle of DET in 10 studies, nine comparing cleavage-stage transfers and two comparing blastocyst-stage transfers.
<RES> When studies were pooled the live birth rate was significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.60, nine studies, n = 1564, I2 = 0%, high quality evidence).
<RES> This suggests that for a woman with a 45% chance of live birth following a single cycle of DET, the chance following a single cycle of SET would be between 24% and 33%.
<RES> The multiple pregnancy rate was also significantly lower in the SET group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.20, 10 studies, n = 1612, I2 = 45%, high quality evidence), suggesting that for a woman with a 14% risk of multiple pregnancy following a single cycle of DET, the risk following a single cycle of SET would be between 1% and 3%.
<RES> The heterogeneity for this analysis was attributable to a study with a high rate of cross-over between treatment arms.
<RES> Other comparisons
<RES> Other comparisons were evaluated in four studies which compared DET versus transfer of three or four embryos.
<RES> Live birth rates did not differ significantly between the groups for any comparison, but there was a significantly lower multiple pregnancy rate in the DET group than in the three embryo transfer (TET) group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.99, two studies, n = 343, I2 = 0%).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In a single fresh IVF cycle, single embryo transfer is associated with a lower live birth rate than double embryo transfer.
<CON> However, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the cumulative live birth rate when a single cycle of double embryo transfer is compared with repeated SET (either two cycles of fresh SET or one cycle of fresh SET followed by one frozen SET in a natural or hormone-stimulated cycle).
<CON> Single embryo transfer is associated with much lower rates of multiple pregnancy than other embryo transfer policies.
<CON> A policy of repeated SET may minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy in couples undergoing ART without substantially reducing the likelihood of achieving a live birth.
<CON> Most of the evidence currently available concerns younger women with a good prognosis.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Workplace interventions for smoking cessation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The workplace appears to be a useful setting for helping people to stop smoking.
<ABS> Large groups of smokers are available who can easily be reached and helped, using proven methods.
<ABS> It is also in the employers’ interests to improve the health of their workforce.
<ABS> Recent changes introducing anti-smoking laws in many developed countries may have eased the pressure to demonstrate the value of work-based programmes.
<ABS> The situation in developing countries still requires that such methods be tested and proved in those communities.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about workplace programmes to help employees stop smoking, and any information about their costs and benefits.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> For this updated review (first published in 2003), we searched for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials, comparing the success rates of those in a work-based stop-smoking programme with those not involved in a work-based stop-smoking programme.
<ABS> The comparison could be between people within a single worksite, or between one or more worksites randomized to a stop-smoking programme or to no programme (cluster-randomized).
<ABS> The study had to include adults (over 18), and could be in any language and reported in any format, published or not.
<ABS> It had to report the numbers stopping smoking for at least six months.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We searched for studies in July 2013, and identified ten new trials that fitted our criteria, making a total for this update of 61 comparisons across 57 included studies.
<ABS> We grouped them into two broad categories: those aimed at helping individual smokers, and those that targeted the workplace environment as a whole.
<ABS> The first group includes such methods as individual or group counselling, self help, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and other medications, help from workmates or other staff, and helping quitters to stay smoke-free.
<ABS> The second group includes environmental cues (posters, reminders), financial or material incentives, and comprehensive smoking cessation or health promotion programmes.
<ABS> The review found that programmes based on group behaviour therapy (eight trials; 1309 participants), on individual counselling (eight trials; 3516 participants), on medications (five trials; 1092 participants), and on several interventions combined (six trials; 5018 participants) helped people to stop smoking.
<ABS> The chances of stopping smoking using these methods are about the same in the workplace as they are in other settings.
<ABS> This review found that the following do not help people to stop smoking when delivered in the workplace: self-help methods, support from friends, family and workmates, relapse prevention programmes, environmental cues, or comprehensive programmes aimed at changing several high-risk behaviours.
<ABS> Results were mixed for incentives, with one high-quality trial finding a clear benefit for incentives while the remaining five did not.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Earlier studies tended to be less well-conducted and reported than recent ones.
<ABS> Fewer than one in five studies randomized their study population by an acceptable method.
<ABS> Two-thirds of the studies checked the accuracy of those who said they had quit by testing their breath, blood or urine.
<ABS> The results were generally in line with findings from other reviews of those ways of quitting in any setting.
<ABS> The 'Summary of findings' table shows that the trials were generally rated as being of moderate to high quality, further confirming the strength of our findings.
<ABS> Future research might examine what features of the large incentives trial made it more successful than other trials in that group.
<ABS> It would also be helpful to have more trials from developing and low-income countries, where smoking rates remain high and anti-smoking laws are not widely enforced.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched abstracts from international conferences on tobacco and the bibliographies of identified studies and reviews for additional references.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We selected interventions conducted in the workplace to promote smoking cessation.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> For this update we have conducted meta-analyses of the main interventions, using the generic inverse variance method to generate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 57 studies (61 comparisons) in this updated review.
<RES> We found 31 studies of workplace interventions aimed at individual workers, covering group therapy, individual counselling, self-help materials, nicotine replacement therapy, and social support, and 30 studies testing interventions applied to the workplace as a whole, i.e. environmental cues, incentives, and comprehensive programmes.
<RES> The trials were generally of moderate to high quality, with results that were consistent with those found in other settings.
<RES> Group therapy programmes (odds ratio (OR) for cessation 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 2.80; eight trials, 1309 participants), individual counselling (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.54; eight trials, 3516 participants), pharmacotherapies (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.11; five trials, 1092 participants), and multiple intervention programmes aimed mainly or solely at smoking cessation (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.13; six trials, 5018 participants) all increased cessation rates in comparison to no treatment or minimal intervention controls.
<RES> Self-help materials were less effective (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.82; six trials, 1906 participants), and two relapse prevention programmes (484 participants) did not help to sustain long-term abstinence.
<RES> Incentives did not appear to improve the odds of quitting, apart from one study which found a sustained positive benefit.
<RES> There was a lack of evidence that comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors reduced the prevalence of smoking.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> 1.
<CON> We found strong evidence that some interventions directed towards individual smokers increase the likelihood of quitting smoking.
<CON> These include individual and group counselling, pharmacological treatment to overcome nicotine addiction, and multiple interventions targeting smoking cessation as the primary or only outcome.
<CON> All these interventions show similar effects whether offered in the workplace or elsewhere.
<CON> Self-help interventions and social support are less effective.
<CON> Although people taking up these interventions are more likely to stop, the absolute numbers who quit are low.
<CON> 2.
<CON> We failed to detect an effect of comprehensive programmes targeting multiple risk factors in reducing the prevalence of smoking, although this finding was not based on meta-analysed data.
<CON> 3.
<CON> There was limited evidence that participation in programmes can be increased by competitions and incentives organized by the employer, although one trial demonstrated a sustained effect of financial rewards for attending a smoking cessation course and for long-term quitting.
<CON> Further research is needed to establish which components of this trial contributed to the improvement in success rates.
<CON> 4.
<CON> Further research would be valuable in low-income and developing countries, where high rates of smoking prevail and smoke-free legislation is not widely accepted or enforced.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> There are many different ways of treating patients with prominent (or sticking out) lower front teeth.
<ABS> Orthodontic treatment for children and adolescents is one method used.
<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, sought to establish which is the most effective type of orthodontic treatment when carried out in childhood; whether these treatments reduce the need for treatment as an adult; and at what age these treatments are best carried out to ensure that changes made to the shape of the jaw and the positioning of the teeth last until the end of growth and can be maintained into adulthood.
<ABS> In severe cases, people may need surgery as adults to correct this condition.
<ABS> If a successful approach to treatment in childhood were to be found, with long-lasting effects, this kind of surgery may not be necessary.
<ABS> Additionally, the risk of damage to teeth and joints, together with the negative psychological effects associated with the condition, could be lessened or avoided.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Prominent lower front teeth can be an important problem for some people and are usually due to the way the jaws meet together.
<ABS> This condition may be the source of teasing, problems eating, and occasionally problems with speech.
<ABS> The condition may also give rise to problems with the jaw joints in later life.
<ABS> Orthodontic treatment relies on the use of appliances of various kinds either inside or outside of the mouth that are fixed in some way to the teeth, and sometimes placed on parts of the head, to influence the growth of the jaws and position of teeth.
<ABS> This review looked at the use of four different types of orthodontic treatment for correcting prominent lower front teeth in children.
<ABS> -Facemask: an appliance rests on the forehead and chin, connected to the upper teeth with elastic bands that are placed by the wearer.
<ABS> Through this arrangement a balanced force is applied, which it is hoped will pull the upper teeth and jaw forwards and downward to correct the prominent lower teeth.
<ABS> -Chin cup: an appliance rests on the chin with a strap around the back of the head.
<ABS> Forward growth of the lower jaw is resisted, correcting the prominence of the lower front teeth.
<ABS> Nothing is placed in the mouth.
<ABS> -Mandibular headgear: a strap rests on the back of the head and is connected to the lower teeth.
<ABS> This resists forward growth of the lower teeth and jaw in order to correct the prominent lower front teeth.
<ABS> -Tandem traction bow appliance: attachments are fixed to the top and bottom teeth.
<ABS> In the top attachment there is a hook on each side.
<ABS> A metal bar is placed in the lower attachment, which sits in front of the lower teeth.
<ABS> An elastic band can then be placed on each side to pull the top jaw forward and bottom jaw backwards, to correct the prominent lower teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was found to be up to date as of 7 January 2013.
<ABS> A total of seven suitable studies were identified and included in this review; they included 339 children aged from five to 11 years.
<ABS> There were roughly equal numbers of girls and boys in each study and participants were from different ethnic groups depending on where the study was carried out.
<ABS> Studies included were conducted in Turkey, Egypt, China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> This review found some evidence that the use of a facemask appliance can help to correct prominent lower front teeth on a short-term basis.
<ABS> There was no evidence available to show whether or not these short-term changes will still be maintained until the child is fully grown.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence to support any other types of treatment for prominent lower front teeth.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence for the use of a facemask was moderate to low, whilst the quality of the rest of the evidence was very low.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward, or both.
<INT> Various treatment approaches have been described to correct prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for prominent lower front teeth in children and adolescents.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Orthodontic treatments were compared with control groups who received either no treatment, delayed treatment or a different active intervention.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Screening of references, identification of included and excluded studies, data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias of the included studies was performed independently and in duplicate by two review authors.
<MaM> The mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous data.
<MaM> Meta-analysis was only undertaken when studies of similar comparisons reported comparable outcome measures.
<MaM> A fixed-effect model was used.
<MaM> The I2 statistic was used as a measure of statistical heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven RCTs with a total of 339 participants were included in this review.
<RES> One study was assessed as at low risk of bias, three studies were at high risk of bias, and in the remaining three studies risk of bias was unclear.
<RES> Four studies reported on the use of a facemask, two on the chin cup, one on the tandem traction bow appliance, and one on mandibular headgear.
<RES> One study reported on both the chin cup and mandibular headgear appliances.
<RES> One study (n = 73, low quality evidence), comparing a facemask to no treatment, reported a mean difference (MD) in overjet of 4.10 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.04 to 5.16; P value < 0.0001) favouring the facemask treatment.
<RES> Two studies comparing facemasks to untreated control did not report the outcome of overjet.
<RES> Three studies (n = 155, low quality evidence) reported ANB (an angular measurement relating the positions of the top and bottom jaws) differences immediately after treatment with a facemask when compared to an untreated control.
<RES> The pooled data showed a statistically significant MD in ANB in favour of the facemask of 3.93 ° (95% CI 3.46 to 4.39; P value < 0.0001).
<RES> There was significant heterogeneity between these studies (I2 = 82%).
<RES> This is likely to have been caused by the different populations studied and the different ages at the time of treatment.
<RES> One study (n = 73, low quality evidence) reported outcomes of the use of the facemask compared to an untreated control at three years follow-up.
<RES> This study showed that improvements in overjet and ANB were still present three years post-treatment.
<RES> In this study, adverse effects were reported but due to the low prevalence of temporomandibular (TMJ) signs and symptoms no analysis was undertaken.
<RES> Two studies (n = 90, low quality evidence) compared the chin cup with an untreated control.
<RES> Both studies found a statistically significant improvement in ANB, and one study also found an improvement in the Wits appraisal.
<RES> Data from these two studies were not suitable for pooling.
<RES> A single study of the tandem traction bow appliance compared to untreated control (n = 30, very low quality evidence) showed a statistically significant difference in both overjet and ANB favouring the intervention group.
<RES> The remaining two studies did not report the primary outcome of this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is some evidence that the use of a facemask to correct prominent lower front teeth in children is effective when compared to no treatment on a short-term basis.
<CON> However, in view of the general poor quality of the included studies, these results should be viewed with caution.
<CON> Further randomised controlled trials with long follow-up are required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Blood clots in the arteries leading to the heart can cause acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina (a feeling of tightness in the chest) or a type of heart attack (non-ST segment myocardial infarction - NSTEMI).
<ABS> Drugs that prevent clots from forming (such as aspirin) or thin the blood (such as heparin) can relieve the problem.
<ABS> Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are two types of heparin.
<ABS> This review of trials found that UFH and LMWH when given to patients with high-risk unstable angina or NSTEMI in the acute phase of treatment, in addition to standard therapy with aspirin, prevent more heart attacks than placebo but do not reduce mortality, the need for revascularization procedures or recurrent angina.
<ABS> Although there was limited reporting of side-effects, heparins caused more cases of minor bleeding.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS) represent a spectrum of disease including unstable angina and non-ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
<INT> Despite treatment with aspirin, beta-blockers and nitroglycerin, unstable angina/NSTEMI is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
<INT> This is an update of a review last published in 2008.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed quality of studies and independently extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There were no new included studies for this update.
<RES> Eight studies (3118 participants) were included in this review.
<RES> We found no evidence for difference in overall mortality between the groups treated with heparin and placebo (risk ratio (RR) = 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.98).
<RES> Heparins compared with placebo, reduced the occurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina and NSTEMI (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63, number needed to benefit (NNTB) = 33).
<RES> There was a trend towards more major bleeds in the heparin studies compared to control studies (RR = 2.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.60).
<RES> From a limited data set, there appeared to be no difference between patients treated with heparins compared to control in the occurrence of thrombocytopenia (RR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.24).
<RES> Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as most of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Compared with placebo, patients treated with heparins had a similar risk of mortality, revascularization, recurrent angina, and thrombocytopenia.
<CON> However, those treated with heparins had a decreased risk of myocardial infarction and a higher incidence of minor bleeding.
<CON> Overall, the evidence assessed in this review was classified as low quality according to the GRADE approach.
<CON> The results presented in this review must therefore be interpreted with caution.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Intravascular brachytherapy for peripheral vascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Intravascular brachytherapy (radiation treatment) inside arteries after angioplasty, stent insertion, or bypass grafts may prevent narrowing of the arteries or grafts.
<ABS> Narrowed and blocked arteries can be treated by bypassing the blockage using a graft, angioplasty (widening the artery by inserting a balloon), or inserting a stent (thin metal sleeve) to hold the artery open.
<ABS> However, restenosis (return of the narrowing or obstruction) often occurs within a year.
<ABS> Intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) aims to prevent restenosis by the application of radiation to the affected part of the artery after the angioplasty or stent insertion.
<ABS> This review included eight studies with a total of 1090 participants.
<ABS> All eight included studies used the femoropopliteal artery.
<ABS> We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries.
<ABS> All trials compared angioplasty with or without stenting plus IVBT with angioplasty with or without stenting alone.
<ABS> No trials were found comparing IVBT to newer technologies such as drug eluting stents, balloons, or cryoplasty.
<ABS> Intravascular brachytherapy resulted in increased cumulative patency, reduced restenosis, and fewer occlusions on short-term follow-ups.
<ABS> However, results from the eight included trials were not consistent and long-term outcomes need to be fully assessed.
<ABS> Therefore, more research is needed especially regarding the long-term outcomes and complications of this treatment, and the health economics and cost-effectiveness data.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> All of these treatments are, however, limited by the high numbers that fail within a year.
<INT> Intravascular brachytherapy is the application of radiation directly to the site of vessel narrowing.
<INT> It is known to inhibit the processes that lead to restenosis (narrowing) of vessels and grafts after treatment.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2002.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and two other review authors independently extracted the data.
<MaM> Adverse event information was collected from the trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight trials with a combined total of 1090 participants were included in this review.
<RES> All included studies used the femoropopliteal artery.
<RES> We did not identify any studies that used the iliac arteries.
<RES> All studies compared PTA with or without stenting plus IVBT versus PTA with or without stenting alone.
<RES> No trials were found comparing IVBT to technologies such as drug eluting stents or balloons, or cryoplasty.
<RES> Follow-up ranged from six months to five years.
<RES> The quality of the included trials was moderate with our concerns relating to the difficulty of blinding due to the nature of the procedures and the small sample sizes for some studies.
<RES> Primary outcomes (patency or restenosis and need for re-intervention) were reported in the majority of the trials, but reporting at various time points and the use of multiple definitions of the outcomes by the included studies meant that not all data were available for pooling.
<RES> The secondary outcomes were not reported in many of the included studies.
<RES> For brachytherapy, cumulative patency was higher at 24 months (odds ratio (OR) 2.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 4.10, n = 222, P = 0.002).
<RES> A statistically significant difference was found for restenosis at six months (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.66, n = 562, P = 0.004), 12 months (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.68, n = 375, P = 0.0002) and 24 months (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.78, n = 164, P = 0.007) in favour of IVBT.
<RES> No difference was found after five years as measured in one study.
<RES> The need for re-interventions was reported in six studies.
<RES> Target lesion revascularisation was significantly reduced in trial participants treated with IVBT compared with angioplasty alone (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97, P = 0.04) at six months after the interventions.
<RES> No statistically significant difference was found between the procedures on the need for re-intervention at 12 and 24 months after the procedures.
<RES> A statistically significant lower number of occlusions was found in the control group at more than three months (OR 11.46, 95% CI 1.44 to 90.96, n = 363, P = 0.02) but no differences were found at less than one month nor at 12 months after the procedures making the clinical significance uncertain.
<RES> Ankle brachial index was statistically significantly better for IVBT at the 12 month follow-up (mean difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14, n = 100, P = 0.02) but no statistically significant differences were found at 24 hours and at six months.
<RES> Quality of life, complications, limb loss, cardiovascular deaths, death from all causes, pain free walking distance and maximum walking distance on a treadmill were similar for the two arms of the trials with no statistically significant difference found between the treatment groups.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence for using peripheral artery brachytherapy as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to maintain patency and for the prevention of restenosis in people with peripheral vascular disease is limited, mainly due to the inconsistency of assessment and reporting of clinically relevant outcomes.
<CON> More data are needed on clinically relevant outcomes such as health related quality of life (HRQOL) or limb salvage and longer-term outcomes, together with comparisons with other techniques such as drug eluting balloons and stents.
<CON> Adequately powered randomised controlled trials, health economics and cost-effectiveness data are required before the procedure could be recommended for widespread use.

<H1> Progestogen for preventing miscarriage

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Progestogen for preventing miscarriage

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We could not find any evidence from randomized controlled trials that progestogen beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy can generally prevent miscarriage.
<ABS> Hormones called progestogens prepare the womb (uterus) to receive and support the newly fertilized egg.
<ABS> It has been suggested that some women who miscarry may not make enough progesterone in the early part of pregnancy, so supplementing with progesterone has been suggested as a possible way to prevent miscarriage.
<ABS> This review of 14 randomized controlled trials (2158 women) found no evidence that progestogens can prevent miscarriage.
<ABS> No difference in the incidence of adverse effects on either the mother or baby were apparent.
<ABS> There was evidence, however, that women who have suffered three or more miscarriages may benefit from progestogen during pregnancy.
<ABS> Four trials showed a decrease in miscarriage compared with placebo or no treatment in these women, however, the trials were of poorer methodological quality so these findings should be interpreted with caution.
<ABS> No differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) verus placebo or no treatment.
<ABS> More trials are needed and are under way to further clarify the effects in women with multiple prior miscarriages and to further clarify any impact on fetal anomalies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Progesterone, a female sex hormone, is known to induce secretory changes in the lining of the uterus essential for successful implantation of a fertilized egg.
<INT> It has been suggested that a causative factor in many cases of miscarriage may be inadequate secretion of progesterone.
<INT> Therefore, progestogens have been used, beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, in an attempt to prevent spontaneous miscarriage.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen trials (2158 women) are included.
<RES> The meta-analysis of all women, regardless of gravidity and number of previous miscarriages, showed no statistically significant difference in the risk of miscarriage between progestogen and placebo or no treatment groups (Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) 0.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.24) and no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse effect in either mother or baby.
<RES> A subgroup analysis of placebo controlled trials did not find a difference in the rate of miscarriage with the use of progestogen (10 trials, 1028 women; Peto OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50).
<RES> In a subgroup analysis of four trials involving women who had recurrent miscarriages (three or more consecutive miscarriages; four trials, 225 women), progestogen treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in miscarriage rate compared to placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.39; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.72).
<RES> However, these four trials were of poorer methodological quality.
<RES> No statistically significant differences were found between the route of administration of progestogen (oral, intramuscular, vaginal) versus placebo or no treatment.
<RES> No significant differences in the rates of preterm birth, neonatal death, or fetal genital anomalies/virilization were found between progestogen therapy versus placebo/control.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no evidence to support the routine use of progestogen to prevent miscarriage in early to mid-pregnancy.
<CON> However, there seems to be evidence of benefit in women with a history of recurrent miscarriage.
<CON> Treatment for these women may be warranted given the reduced rates of miscarriage in the treatment group and the finding of no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups in rates of adverse effects suffered by either mother or baby in the available evidence.
<CON> Larger trials are currently underway to inform treatment for this group of women.

<H1> Preoperative education for hip or knee replacement

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Preoperative education for hip or knee replacement

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preoperative education refers to any educational intervention delivered before surgery that aims to improve people's knowledge, health behaviours and health outcomes.
<ABS> The content of preoperative education varies across settings, but frequently comprises discussion of presurgical procedures, the actual steps in the surgical procedure, postoperative care, potential stressful scenarios associated with surgery, potential surgical and non-surgical complications, postoperative pain management and movements to avoid post-surgery.
<ABS> Education is often provided by physiotherapists, nurses or members of multidisciplinary teams, including psychologists.
<ABS> The format of education ranges from one-to-one verbal communication, patient group sessions, or video or booklet with no verbal communication.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research on whether preoperative education improves outcomes (e.g. pain, function) compared with usual care in people receiving hip or knee replacement.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies to May 2013, we included nine new studies since the last review, giving a total of 18 studies (1463 participants); 13 trials included 1074 people (73% of the total) undergoing hip replacement, three involved people undergoing knee replacement and two included both people with hip and knee replacements.
<ABS> Most participants were women (59%) and the mean age of participants was within the range of 58 to 73 years
<ABS> Key results - what happens to people who have preoperative education compared with people who have usual care for hip replacement
<ABS> Postoperative anxiety (lower scores mean less anxiety):
<ABS> Pain (lower scores mean less pain):
<ABS> Function (lower scores mean better function or less disability):
<ABS> Side effects:
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review shows that in people receiving hip or knee replacement who are provided with preoperative education:
<ABS> There is low-quality evidence suggesting that preoperative education may not improve pain, function, health-related quality of life and postoperative anxiety any more than usual care.
<ABS> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these estimates and is likely to change the estimates.
<ABS> Health-related quality of life, global assessment of treatment success and re-operation rates were not reported.
<ABS> We are uncertain whether preoperative education results in any fewer adverse events, such as infection or deep vein thrombosis, compared with usual care, due to the very low quality evidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Hip or knee replacement is a major surgical procedure that can be physically and psychologically stressful for patients.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2013), EMBASE (1980 to May 2013), CINAHL (1982 to May 2013), PsycINFO (1872 to May 2013) and PEDro to July 2010.
<MaM> We handsearched the Australian Journal of Physiotherapy (1954 to 2009) and reviewed the reference lists of included trials and other relevant reviews.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios.
<MaM> We combined continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Where possible, we pooled data using a random-effects meta-analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 18 trials (1463 participants) in the review.
<RES> Thirteen trials involved people undergoing hip replacement, three involved people undergoing knee replacement and two included both people with hip and knee replacements.
<RES> Only six trials reported using an adequate method of allocation concealment, and only two trials blinded participants.
<RES> Few trials reported sufficient data to analyse the major outcomes of the review (pain, function, health-related quality of life, global assessment, postoperative anxiety, total adverse events and re-operation rate).
<RES> There did not appear to be an effect of time on any outcome, so we chose to include only the latest time point available per outcome in the review.
<RES> In people undergoing hip replacement, preoperative education may not offer additional benefits over usual care.
<RES> The mean postoperative anxiety score at six weeks with usual care was 32.16 on a 60-point scale (lower score represents less anxiety) and was 2.28 points lower with preoperative education (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.68 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 264 participants, low-quality evidence), an absolute risk difference of -4% (95% CI -10% to 2%).
<RES> The mean pain score up to three months postoperatively with usual care was 3.1 on a 10-point scale (lower score represents less pain) and was 0.34 points lower with preoperative education (95% CI -0.94 to 0.26; 3 RCTs, 227 participants; low-quality evidence), an absolute risk difference of -3% (95% CI -9% to 3%).
<RES> The mean function score at 3 to 24 months postoperatively with usual care was 18.4 on a 68-point scale (lower score represents better function) and was 4.84 points lower with preoperative education (95% CI -10.23 to 0.66; 4 RCTs, 177 participants; low-quality evidence), an absolute risk difference of -7% (95% CI -15% to 1%).
<RES> The number of people reporting adverse events, such as infection and deep vein thrombosis, did not differ between groups, but the effect estimates are uncertain due to very low quality evidence (23% (17/75) reported events with usual care versus 18% (14/75) with preoperative education; risk ratio (RR) 0.79; 95% CI 0.19 to 3.21; 2 RCTs, 150 participants).
<RES> Health-related quality of life, global assessment of treatment success and re-operation rates were not reported.
<RES> In people undergoing knee replacement, preoperative education may not offer additional benefits over usual care.
<RES> The mean pain score at 12 months postoperatively with usual care was 80 on a 100-point scale (lower score represents less pain) and was 2 points lower with preoperative education (95% CI -3.45 to 7.45; 1 RCT, 109 participants), an absolute risk difference of -2% (95% CI -4% to 8%).
<RES> The mean function score at 12 months postoperatively with usual care was 77 on a 100-point scale (lower score represents better function) and was no different with preoperative education (0; 95% CI -5.63 to 5.63; 1 RCT, 109 participants), an absolute risk difference of 0% (95% CI -6% to 6%).
<RES> The mean health-related quality of life score at 12 months postoperatively with usual care was 41 on a 100-point scale (lower score represents worse quality of life) and was 3 points lower with preoperative education (95% CI -6.38 to 0.38; 1 RCT, 109 participants), an absolute risk difference of -3% (95% CI -6% to 1%).
<RES> The number of people reporting adverse events, such as infection and deep vein thrombosis, did not differ between groups (18% (11/60) reported events with usual care versus 13% (7/55) with preoperative education; RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.66; 1 RCT, 115 participants), an absolute risk difference of -6% (-19% to 8%).
<RES> Global assessment of treatment success, postoperative anxiety and re-operation rates were not reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Although preoperative education is embedded in the consent process, we are unsure if it offers benefits over usual care in terms of reducing anxiety, or in surgical outcomes, such as pain, function and adverse events.

<H1> Antibiotics and antiseptics for venous leg ulcers

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics and antiseptics to help healing venous leg ulcers

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Venous leg ulcers are a type of wound that can take a long time to heal.
<ABS> These ulcers can become infected, and this might cause further delay to healing.
<ABS> Two types of treatment are available to treat infection: systemic antibiotics (i.e. antibiotics taken by mouth or by injection) and topical preparations (i.e. treatments applied directly to the wound).
<ABS> Whether systemic or topical preparations are used, patients will also usually have a wound dressing and bandage over the wound.
<ABS> This review was undertaken to find out whether using antibiotics and antiseptics works better than usual care in healing venous leg ulcers, and if so, to find out which antibiotic and antiseptic preparations are better than others.
<ABS> In terms of topical preparations, some evidence is available to support the use of cadexomer iodine (a topical agent thought to have cleansing and antibacterial effects).
<ABS> Current evidence does not support the use of honey- or silver-based products.
<ABS> Further good quality research is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of antibiotic tablets and topical agents such as povidone-iodine, peroxide-based products and other topical antibiotics and antiseptics in healing venous leg ulceration.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Venous leg ulcers are a type of chronic wound affecting up to 1% of adults in developed countries at some point during their lives.
<INT> Many of these wounds are colonised by bacteria or show signs of clinical infection.
<INT> The presence of infection may delay ulcer healing.
<INT> Two main strategies are used to prevent and treat clinical infection in venous leg ulcers: systemic antibiotics and topical antibiotics or antiseptics.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The objective of this review was to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics and topical antibiotics and antiseptics on the healing of venous ulcers.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> No language or publication date restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Selection decisions were made by two review authors while working independently.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Information on the characteristics of participants, interventions and outcomes was recorded on a standardised data extraction form.
<MaM> Data extraction and validity assessment were conducted by one review author and were checked by a second.
<MaM> Data were pooled when appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ulcer infection status at baseline and duration of follow-up varied across RCTs.
<RES> Five RCTs reported eight comparisons of systemic antibiotics, and the remainder evaluated topical preparations: cadexomer iodine (11 RCTs reporting 12 comparisons); povidone-iodine (six RCTs reporting seven comparisons); peroxide-based preparations (four RCTs reporting four comparisons); honey-based preparations (two RCTs reporting two comparisons); silver-based preparations (12 RCTs reporting 13 comparisons); other topical antibiotics (three RCTs reporting five comparisons); and other topical antiseptics (two RCTs reporting two comparisons).
<RES> Few RCTs provided a reliable estimate of time to healing; most reported the proportion of participants with complete healing during the trial period.
<RES> Systemic antibiotics
<RES> More participants were healed when they were prescribed levamisole (normally used to treat roundworm infection) compared with placebo: risk ratio (RR) 1.31 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.62).
<RES> No between-group differences were detected in terms of complete healing for other comparisons: antibiotics given according to antibiogram versus usual care; ciprofloxacin versus standard care/placebo; trimethoprim versus placebo; ciprofloxacin versus trimethoprim; and amoxicillin versus topical povidone-iodine.
<RES> Topical antibiotics and antiseptics
<RES> Cadexomer iodine: more participants were healed when given cadexomer iodine compared with standard care.
<RES> The pooled estimate from four RCTs for complete healing at four to 12 weeks was RR 2.17 (95% CI 1.30 to 3.60).
<RES> No between-group differences in complete healing were detected when cadexomer iodine was compared with the following: hydrocolloid dressing; paraffin gauze dressing; dextranomer; and silver-impregnated dressings.
<RES> Povidone iodine: no between-group differences in complete healing were detected when povidone-iodine was compared with the following: hydrocolloid; moist or foam dressings according to wound status; and growth factor.
<RES> Time to healing estimates for povidone-iodine versus dextranomer, and for povidone-iodine versus hydrocolloid, were likely to be unreliable.
<RES> Peroxide-based preparations: four RCTs reported findings in favour of peroxide-based preparations when compared with usual care for surrogate healing outcomes (change in ulcer area).
<RES> There was no report of complete healing.
<RES> Honey-based preparations: no between-group difference in time to healing or complete healing was detected for honey-based products when compared with usual care.
<RES> Silver-based preparations: no between-group differences in complete healing were detected when 1% silver sulphadiazine ointment was compared with standard care/placebo and tripeptide copper complex; or when different brands of silver-impregnated dressings were compared; or when silver-impregnated dressings were compared with non-antimicrobial dressings.
<RES> Other topical antibiotics: data from one RCT suggested that more participants healed at four weeks when treated with an enzymatic cleanser (a non-antibiotic preparation) compared with a chloramphenicol-containing ointment (additional active ingredients also included in the ointment): RR 0.13 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.99).
<RES> No between-group differences in complete healing were detected for framycetin sulphate ointment versus enzymatic cleanser; chloramphenicol ointment versus framycetin sulphate ointment; mupirocin ointment versus vehicle; and topical antibiotics given according to antibiogram versus an herbal ointment.
<RES> Other topical antiseptics: data from one RCT suggested that more participants receiving an antiseptic ointment (ethacridine lactate) had responsive ulcers (defined as > 20% reduction in area) at four weeks when compared with placebo: RR 1.45 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73).
<RES> Complete healing was not reported.
<RES> No between-group difference was detected between chlorhexidine solution and usual care.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> At present, no evidence is available to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics in promoting healing of venous leg ulcers.
<CON> However, the lack of reliable evidence means that it is not possible to recommend the discontinuation of any of the agents reviewed.
<CON> In terms of topical preparations, some evidence supports the use of cadexomer iodine.
<CON> Current evidence does not support the routine use of honey- or silver-based products.
<CON> Further good quality research is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of povidone-iodine, peroxide-based preparations, ethacridine lactate, chloramphenicol, framycetin, mupirocin, ethacridine or chlorhexidine in healing venous leg ulceration.
<CON> In light of the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, current prescribing guidelines recommend that antibacterial preparations should be used only in cases of clinical infection, not for bacterial colonisation.

<H1> Omalizumab for asthma in adults and children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Omalizumab for chronic asthma in adults and children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence for the effect of omalizumab on people with asthma when compared with placebo.
<ABS> We focused on whether omalizumab is a beneficial but safe treatment for adults and children with asthma.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide.
<ABS> It is thought that allergy may be an important part of the disease for many people with asthma.
<ABS> Omalizumab is a drug that targets a protein, called IgE, and removes it from free circulation in the body.
<ABS> IgE is centrally involved in allergy.
<ABS> Omalizumab is an expensive drug that is usually given by injection under the skin every two to four weeks.
<ABS> It is licenced for use in asthma sufferers who are not being adequately treated with standard therapy and who require frequent courses or continuous use of oral steroid tablets.
<ABS> We looked for evidence on whether administration of omalizumab is better or worse than giving placebo.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Twenty-five studies, involving 6382 people, were included in this review.
<ABS> These studies lasted between eight and 60 weeks.
<ABS> All of the people included in the studies had asthma, of different severity.
<ABS> Both men and women were included, and some of the studies included children and young people.
<ABS> All studies compared omalizumab versus placebo.
<ABS> In keeping with current medical practice, most studies (21 of 25) used omalizumab given by injection under the skin.
<ABS> Some of the older studies used omalizumab injected into a vein or given by inhalation.
<ABS> The evidence presented here is current to June 2013.
<ABS> Most of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that people receiving omalizumab were less likely to have a flare-up (‘exacerbation’) of their asthma.
<ABS> For example, on average, 26 of 100 people who were receiving placebo (over a 16 to 60-week period) had an exacerbation compared with an average of 16 of 100 people receiving omalizumab.
<ABS> People receiving omalizumab were also more likely to be able to reduce the doses of inhaled steroids.
<ABS> For example, on average, 21 of 100 people with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving placebo were able to completely stop their inhaled steroids (over a 28 to 32-week period) compared with an average of 40 of 100 receiving omalizumab.
<ABS> People receiving omalizumab also experienced improvement in their asthma symptoms and in their health-related quality of life.
<ABS> People receiving omalizumab were no more or less likely to have unwanted side effects overall.
<ABS> However, people receiving omalizumab were more likely to have skin reactions at the site of the injection.
<ABS> Perhaps unfortunately, many of the trials in this review included participants with moderate asthma, and this drug is not licenced for this group.
<ABS> More trials need to focus on whether this drug is effective in people with the most severe asthma; evidence for efficacy in this group is poor, in spite of current guidelines.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented in this review is generally of moderate quality.
<ABS> Most of the studies did not clearly explain how investigators decided which people would receive omalizumab and which would receive placebo, and this decision is an important part of well-conducted studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Asthma is a respiratory (airway) condition that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
<INT> It is called an 'anti-IgE' drug.
<INT> IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials for potentially relevant studies.
<MaM> The most recent search was performed in June 2013.
<MaM> We also checked the reference lists of included trials and searched online trial registries and drug company websites.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data.
<MaM> Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous and subcutaneous injection.
<MaM> The main focus of the updated review is subcutaneous administration, as this route is currently used in clinical practice.
<MaM> Subgroup analysis was performed by asthma severity.
<MaM> Data were extracted from published and unpublished sources.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In all, 25 trials were included in the review, including 11 new studies since the last update, for a total of 19 that considered the efficacy of subcutaneous anti-IgE treatment as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids.
<RES> For participants with moderate or severe asthma who were receiving background inhaled corticosteroid steroid (ICS) therapy, a significant advantage favoured subcutaneous omalizumab with regard to experiencing an asthma exacerbation (odds ratio (OR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.60; ten studies, 3261 participants).
<RES> This represents an absolute reduction from 26% for participants suffering an exacerbation on placebo to 16% on omalizumab, over 16 to 60 weeks.
<RES> A significant benefit was noted for subcutaneous omalizumab versus placebo with regard to reducing hospitalisations (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; four studies, 1824 participants), representing an absolute reduction in risk from 3% with placebo to 0.5% with omalizumab over 28 to 60 weeks.
<RES> No separate data on hospitalisations were available for the severe asthma subgroup, and all of these data were reported for participants with the diagnosis of moderate to severe asthma.
<RES> Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab were also significantly more likely to be able to withdraw their ICS completely than those treated with placebo (OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.00 to 3.13), and a small but statistically significant reduction in daily inhaled steroid dose was reported for omalizumab-treated participants compared with those given placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) -118 mcg beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent per day, 95% CI -154 to -84).
<RES> However, no significant difference between omalizumab and placebo treatment groups was seen in the number of participants who were able to withdraw from oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.63).
<RES> Participants treated with subcutaneous omalizumab as an adjunct to treatment with corticosteroids required a small but significant reduction in rescue beta2-agonist medication compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.39 puffs per day, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.24; nine studies, 3524 participants).
<RES> This benefit was observed in both the moderate to severe (MD -0.58, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.31) and severe (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.10) asthma subgroups on a background therapy of inhaled corticosteroids; however, no significant difference between subcutaneous omalizumab and placebo was noted for this outcome in participants with severe asthma who were receiving a background therapy of inhaled plus oral corticosteroids.
<RES> Significantly fewer serious adverse events were reported in participants assigned to subcutaneous omalizumab than in those receiving placebo (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 15 studies, 5713 participants), but more injection site reactions were observed (from 5.6% with placebo to 9.1% with omalizumab).
<RES> To reflect current clinical practice, discussion of the results is limited to subcutaneous use, and trials involving intravenous and inhaled routes have been archived.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Omalizumab was effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and hospitalisations as an adjunctive therapy to inhaled steroids and during steroid tapering phases of clinical trials.
<CON> Omalizumab was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing the numbers of participants who were able to reduce or withdraw their inhaled steroids.
<CON> Further assessment in paediatric populations is necessary, as is direct double-dummy comparison with ICS.
<CON> Although subgroup analyses suggest that participants receiving prednisolone had better asthma control when they received omalizumab, it remains to be tested prospectively whether the addition of omalizumab has a prednisolone-sparing effect.
<CON> It is also not clear whether there is a threshold level of baseline serum IgE for optimum efficacy of omalizumab.
<CON> Given the high cost of the drug, identification of biomarkers predictive of response is of major importance for future research.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Two randomised controlled trials were included in this review involving a total of 271 women with twin pregnancies at 37 weeks' gestation.
<ABS> One of the two trials (involving 235 women) was of high quality, and the quality of the second trial (involving 36 women) was unclear.
<ABS> There were no differences shown between the group of women who had an elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation and the group of women who waited for labour to start spontaneously for the outcomes: birth by caesarean section, perinatal (fetal or neonatal) death or serious perinatal morbidity, or maternal death or serious maternal morbidity.
<ABS> No other differences between the two groups of women were shown for other pregnancy and birth complications or for complications for the infant.
<ABS> Elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation compared with ongoing expectant management for women with uncomplicated twin pregnancies does not appear be associated with an increased risk of harms.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two randomised controlled trials comparing elective birth at 37 weeks for women with an uncomplicated twin pregnancy, with expectant management were included, involving 271 women and 542 infants.
<RES> One trial was at an overall low risk of bias, and one trial was at unclear risk of selection bias, performance bias and detection bias.
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences identified between a policy of elective birth at 37 weeks' gestation and expectant management with regards to birth by caesarean section (two studies; 271 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.32); perinatal death or serious perinatal morbidity (two studies; 542 infants; RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.01 to 8.35); or maternal death or serious maternal morbidity (one study; 235 women; RR 0.29; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38).
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences identified for the pre-specified secondary maternal and infant review outcomes reported by these two trials between the two treatment policies (including for: haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion; instrumental vaginal birth; meconium-stained liquor; Apgar score less than seven at five minutes; admission to neonatal intensive care; birthweight less than 2500 g; neonatal encephalopathy; and respiratory distress syndrome).
<RES> While not a pre-specified review outcome, elective birth at 37 weeks, compared with expectant management, was shown to significantly reduce the risk of infants being born with a birthweight less than the third centile (one study; 470 infants; RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.68).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It is unlikely that sufficient clinical equipoise exists to allow for the randomisation of women to a later gestational age at birth.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of audio-visual presentation of information used in the informed consent process for people considering entering a clinical trial.
<ABS> We compared this with the usual informed consent information (either written and/or verbal) and placebo (sham) audio-visual information.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Before taking part in a clinical trial, potential participants must be provided with detailed information, such as what they will be asked to do and any possible benefits or harms.
<ABS> Once they understand what is involved, and if they are happy to take part, they usually sign a consent form.
<ABS> This process is known as 'informed consent'.
<ABS> The problem is that consent forms use technical language that can be hard to for the average person to understand.
<ABS> Sometimes people agree to take part in a clinical trial even though they are unsure what is involved.
<ABS> Presenting the consent form information in an audio-visual format (for example, on a computer or DVD) might improve the informed consent process.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched for studies of audio-visual informed consent interventions which allocated people to an experimental or control group by a random or quasi-random process, published up until June 2012.
<ABS> We found 16 studies, involving a total of 1884 people.
<ABS> Nine studies included people considering real clinical trials, eight included people asked to imagine participating in a clinical trial (a hypothetical trial), with one including both.
<ABS> Most of the studies were conducted in the United States.
<ABS> People were considering (or imagined considering) participation in a range of different clinical trials, including those testing cancer treatments and drugs for mental health problems.
<ABS> The audio-visual informed consent information was presented on computers, DVDs, videos and CD-ROMs.
<ABS> They included voice overs by professional actors, real patients talking about their experiences and a combination of words, pictures and audio to explain the technical concepts.
<ABS> In some studies, people also received the usual written informed consent forms and/or a face-to-face explanation by the study staff.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is low to very low quality evidence that audio-visual consent interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate.
<ABS> Audio-visual presentation may improve participation satisfaction with the information provided.
<ABS> However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear.
<ABS> There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent.
<ABS> There is conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions take more or less time to administer, and no study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use.
<ABS> We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of evidence from real clinical trials was low, and from hypothetical clinical studies, very low.
<ABS> This is because of the small number of people in the studies, and some issues in the way they were conducted.
<ABS> If the next update of this review includes more studies of audio-visual informed consent presentation, it could change the results of this review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Informed consent is a critical component of clinical research.
<INT> Different methods of presenting information to potential participants of clinical trials may improve the informed consent process.
<INT> Audio-visual interventions (presented, for example, on the Internet or on DVD) are one such method.
<INT> We updated a 2008 review of the effects of these interventions for informed consent for trial participation.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles, and contacted study authors and experts.
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials involved individuals or their guardians asked to consider participating in a real or hypothetical clinical study.
<MaM> (In the earlier version of this review we only included studies evaluating informed consent interventions for real studies).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.
<MaM> We synthesised the findings using meta-analysis, where possible, and narrative synthesis of results.
<MaM> We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies and considered the impact of the quality of the overall evidence on the strength of the results.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 16 studies involving data from 1884 participants.
<RES> Nine studies included participants considering real clinical trials, and eight included participants considering hypothetical clinical trials, with one including both.
<RES> All studies were conducted in high-income countries.
<RES> There is still much uncertainty about the effect of audio-visual informed consent interventions on a range of patient outcomes.
<RES> However, when considered across comparisons, we found low to very low quality evidence that such interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate.
<RES> Audio-visual presentation of informed consent may improve participant satisfaction with the consent information provided.
<RES> However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear.
<RES> There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent.
<RES> We found conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions took more or less time to administer.
<RES> No study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use.
<RES> The evidence from real clinical trials was rated as low quality for most outcomes, and for hypothetical studies, very low.
<RES> We note, however, that this was in large part due to poor study reporting, the hypothetical nature of some studies and low participant numbers, rather than inconsistent results between studies or confirmed poor trial quality.
<RES> We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The value of audio-visual interventions as a tool for helping to enhance the informed consent process for people considering participating in clinical trials remains largely unclear, although trends are emerging with regard to improvements in knowledge and satisfaction.
<CON> Many relevant outcomes have not been evaluated in randomised trials.
<CON> Triallists should continue to explore innovative methods of providing information to potential trial participants during the informed consent process, mindful of the range of outcomes that the intervention should be designed to achieve, and balancing the resource implications of intervention development and delivery against the purported benefits of any intervention.
<CON> More trials, adhering to CONSORT standards, and conducted in settings and populations underserved in this review, i.e. low- and middle-income countries and people with low literacy, would strengthen the results of this review and broaden its applicability.
<CON> Assessing process measures, such as time taken to administer the intervention and researcher satisfaction, would inform the implementation of audio-visual consent materials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Blood clots may form in the veins of patients who are admitted to hospital suffering from an acute medical illness.
<ABS> The extensive experience from clot prevention studies in surgical patients is therefore not necessarily applicable to non-surgical patients.
<ABS> Heparin is a blood thinning drug, which has been shown to reduce the occurrence of blood clots in patients after they have had surgery.
<ABS> Heparin exists in two forms, the original unfractionated (UFH) form and a newer form called low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
<ABS> The aim of the current review is to determine the effectiveness and safety of heparin (UFH or LMWH) to prevent DVTs and PEs in non-surgical, medical patients admitted to hospital, excluding those admitted to hospital with a heart attack or stroke or those requiring admission to an intensive care unit.
<ABS> The outcomes investigated in this review were DVT, PE that did not cause death, PE that resulted in death, combined non-fatal and fatal PE, all-cause death, bleeding complications and thrombocytopaenia, which is a condition that can be caused by heparin and results in decreased platelets in the blood.
<ABS> This review of 16 trials in 34,369 non-surgical patients who suffered an acute medical illness found that heparin reduced the number of patients suffering DVTs but also increased the risk of bleeding complications when compared to participants that received a placebo or no medication.
<ABS> We had some concerns over how reliable the results were from the unblinded studies, which made up just under half of the studies.
<ABS> Also, most of the studies were lacking explanations of how the allocation of the treatments was performed.
<ABS> The lower risk of PEs (when combining those that caused death and those that did not) with heparin could have been a chance effect.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rate of death or thrombocytopaenia.
<ABS> The review also found that patients who were given LMWH developed fewer DVTs and fewer bleeding complications compared with those given UFH, leading to the conclusion that LMWH is more effective and carries a lower risk of adverse events in preventing blood clots than with UFH.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of differences between LMWH and UFH for PE, death or thrombocytopaenia.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Venous thromboembolic disease has been extensively studied in surgical patients.
<INT> The benefit of thromboprophylaxis is now generally accepted, but it is medical patients who make up the greater proportion of the hospital population.
<INT> Medical patients differ from surgical patients with regard to their health and the pathogenesis of thromboembolism and the impact that preventative measures can have.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One review author identified possible trials and a second review author confirmed their eligibility for inclusion in the review.
<MaM> Two review authors extracted the data.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved by discussion.
<MaM> We performed the meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model with the results expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Sixteen studies with a combined total of 34,369 participants with an acute medical illness were included in this review.
<RES> We identified 10 studies comparing heparin with placebo or no treatment and six studies comparing LMWH to UFH.
<RES> Just under half of the studies had an open-label design, putting them at a risk of performance bias.
<RES> Descriptions of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were missing in most of the studies.
<RES> Heparin reduced the odds of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.51; P < 0.00001).
<RES> The estimated reductions in symptomatic non-fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.10; P = 0.08), fatal PE (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.15; P = 0.16) and in combined non-fatal PE and fatal PE (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.00; P = 0.05) associated with heparin were imprecise.
<RES> Heparin resulted in an increase in major haemorrhage (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.98; P = 0.02).
<RES> There was no clear evidence that heparin had an effect on all-cause mortality and thrombocytopaenia.
<RES> Compared with UFH, LMWH reduced the risk of DVT (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02) and major bleeding (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.83; P = 0.01).
<RES> There was no clear evidence that the effects of LMWH and UFH differed for the PE outcomes, all-cause mortality and thrombocytopaenia.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This needs to be balanced against an increase in the risk of bleeding associated with thromboprophylaxis.
<CON> The analysis favoured LMWH compared with UFH, with a reduced risk of both DVT and bleeding.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Type of incision for below knee amputation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Below knee amputation may be necessary for people with critical limb ischaemia caused by advanced vascular disease or diabetic foot infection (sepsis) where no other treatment option is possible.
<ABS> Keeping the knee joint gives a better chance of walking using an artificial leg or prosthesis and social independence after the amputation.
<ABS> The surgical technique is important.
<ABS> Bone and deep tissues are generally treated in a similar way but the type of skin incision varies between techniques.
<ABS> A skin flap is designed to go over the stump, where the main consideration is to maximise blood supply and healing.
<ABS> A long posterior skin flap and unequal (skewed) anterior and posterior muscle and skin (myocutaneous) flaps are most often used, although other techniques have been described.
<ABS> Three randomised controlled studies were identified.
<ABS> Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate.
<ABS> They were reported on between 1977 and 1991 and involved a total of 309 participants.
<ABS> Each reported on different comparisons.
<ABS> Below knee amputation using skew flaps or sagittal flaps provided no advantage over the long posterior flap technique on primary stump healing, which approached 60% for all groups.
<ABS> In the third study, involving 30 participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure with delayed skin closure.
<ABS> Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.
<ABS> Nearly all the surgeons in the study that looked at skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique were new to the skew flap operation and so were on a learning curve.
<ABS> Factors which might have influenced the findings include previous experience of a technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and location of pre-existing surgical scars.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There is no consensus as to which surgical technique achieves the maximum rehabilitation potential.
<INT> This is the third update of the review first published in 2004.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of different types of incision on the outcome of BKA in people with lower limb ischaemia or diabetic foot sepsis, or both.
<OBJ> The main focus of the review was to assess the relative merits of skew flap amputation versus the long posterior flap technique.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more types of skin incision for BKA were identified.
<MaM> People with lower limb ischaemia (acute or chronic) or diabetic foot sepsis, or both, were considered for inclusion.
<MaM> People undergoing below knee amputation for other conditions were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One review author identified potential trials.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies with a combined total of 309 participants were included in the review.
<RES> One study compared two-stage versus one-stage BKA; one study compared skew flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA; and one study compared sagittal flaps BKA versus long posterior flap BKA.
<RES> Overall the quality of the evidence from these studies was moderate.
<RES> BKA using skew flaps or sagittal flaps conferred no advantage over the well established long posterior flap technique (primary stump healing was 60% for both skew flaps and long posterior flap (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.42) and primary stump healing was 58% for sagittal flaps and 55% for long posterior flap (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.43).
<RES> For participants with wet gangrene, a two-stage procedure with a guillotine amputation at the ankle followed by a definitive long posterior flap amputation led to better primary stump healing than a one-stage procedure (Peto OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.89).
<RES> Post-operative infection rate or wound necrosis, reamputation, and mobility with a prosthetic limb were similar in the different comparisons.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no evidence to show a benefit of one type of incision over another.
<CON> However, in the presence of wet gangrene a two-stage procedure leads to better primary stump healing compared to a one-stage procedure.
<CON> The choice of amputation technique can, therefore, be a matter of surgeon preference taking into account factors such as previous experience of a particular technique, the extent of non-viable tissue, and the location of pre-existing surgical scars.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Ugly white marks sometimes appear on the teeth during orthodontic (brace) treatment.
<ABS> These are caused by early tooth decay and usually occur with fixed (or glued-on 'train track') braces when the teeth are not cleaned properly.
<ABS> We know that fluoride in toothpaste helps to prevent dental decay; therefore, extra fluoride provided to people wearing braces should protect them from these marks.
<ABS> This review, produced by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, examines the evidence for this in existing research.
<ABS> The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of fluorides in preventing early tooth decay during orthodontic (brace) treatment and to determine the best way to do this.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Early tooth decay around the brackets that attach braces to the teeth can cause white or brown marks (demineralised white lesions (DWLs)) to appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment.
<ABS> Build-up of dental plaque around these brackets is associated with increased risk of rapid demineralisation of the enamel of teeth.
<ABS> Demineralisation is an early, but reversible, stage in the development of tooth decay.
<ABS> Wearing of fixed braces may be associated with pain, and both the brace and the pain make toothbrushing more difficult, which in turn means that it is harder to prevent the build-up of plaque.
<ABS> People often wear braces for 18 months or longer, and there is a risk that tooth decay will damage the teeth, requiring restorations and fillings to be done.
<ABS> Fluoride is effective in reducing tooth decay in people who are at risk of developing it.
<ABS> Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment.
<ABS> It is important to consider how the fluoride is to be applied and whether children and adolescents (receiving fixed brace treatment) are likely to be willing and able to regularly apply by themselves the amounts needed to prevent early tooth decay.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up-to-date as of 31 January 2013.
<ABS> Three studies with 458 participants were included in this updated review.
<ABS> Participants were undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed braces, and DWLs were assessed on teeth remaining in the mouth at the end of orthodontic treatment.
<ABS> The different ways of applying fluoride that were assessed included:
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> One study showed that when the dentist paints fluoride-containing varnish around the teeth and brace every time it is adjusted, the risk of developing white marks is reduced by nearly 70%; however, further well-designed trials are required to confirm this finding.
<ABS> The rest of the evidence is weak, and more studies are needed to show the best way of delivering extra fluoride to people wearing braces.
<ABS> Adverse effects or harms of interventions were not reported in any of the included studies.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence found is moderate in the case of one well-designed study and weak in the remaining studies.
<ABS> Recommendations state that further well-conducted research should be conducted in this area.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Demineralised white lesions (DWLs) can appear on teeth during fixed brace treatment because of early decay around the brackets that attach the braces to the teeth.
<INT> Fluoride is effective in reducing decay in susceptible individuals in the general population.
<INT> Individuals receiving orthodontic treatment may be prescribed various forms of fluoride treatment.
<INT> This review compares the effects of various forms of fluoride used during orthodontic treatment on the development of DWLs.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of fluoride in reducing the incidence of DWLs on the teeth during orthodontic treatment.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data.
<MaM> Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology.
<MaM> The Cochrane Collaboration's statistical guidelines were followed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> For the 2013 update of this review, three changes were made to the protocol regarding inclusion criteria.
<RES> Fourteen studies included in the previous version of the review were excluded from this update for the following reasons: five previously included studies were quasi-randomised, a further five were split-mouth studies, three measured outcomes on extracted teeth only and in one, the same fluoride intervention was used in each intervention group of the study.
<RES> Three studies and 458 participants were included in this updated review.
<RES> One placebo-controlled study of fluoride varnish applied every six weeks (253 participants, low risk of bias), provided moderate-quality evidence of an almost 70% reduction in DWLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.44, P value < 0.001).
<RES> This finding is considered to provide moderate-quality evidence for this intervention because it has not yet been replicated by further studies in orthodontic participants.
<RES> One study compared two different formulations of fluoride toothpaste and mouthrinse prescribed for participants undergoing orthodontic treatment (97 participants, unclear risk of bias) and found no difference between an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination and a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination for the outcomes of white spot index, visible plaque index and gingival bleeding index.
<RES> One small study (37 participants) compared the use of an intraoral fluoride-releasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse.
<RES> The study was assessed at high risk of bias because a substantial number of participants were lost to follow-up, and compliance with use of the mouthrinse was not measured.
<RES> Neither secondary outcomes of this review nor adverse effects of interventions were reported in any of the included studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review found some moderate evidence that fluoride varnish applied every six weeks at the time of orthodontic review during treatment is effective, but this finding is based on a single study.
<CON> Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DWLs on participant satisfaction with treatment.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Thiazide diuretics for the treatment of high blood pressure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs commonly recommended as first-line treatment for raised blood pressure because they significantly reduce death, stroke and heart attacks.
<ABS> This class includes bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and metolazone.
<ABS> We asked by how much does this class of drugs lower blood pressure and whether there is a difference between individual drugs within the class.
<ABS> We searched the available scientific literature to find all the trials that had assessed this question.
<ABS> The data included in this review was up to date as of February 2014.
<ABS> We found 60 trials that randomly assigned 11,282 adult participants, mean age 55 years, 53% male and 47% female, with blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg (mean blood pressure 158/99 mmHg) to take one of six thiazide diuretics or placebo for an average duration of eight weeks.
<ABS> Most of the trials (82%) were published before the year 2000 and most were found to have a high risk of bias in the adverse effect data.
<ABS> Co-morbidities were not reported in most trials.
<ABS> The blood pressure-lowering effect was modest.
<ABS> Thiazide diuretics reduced blood pressure by 9 points in the upper number (called systolic blood pressure) and 4 points in the lower number (called diastolic blood pressure).
<ABS> Different thiazide drugs have similar effects in lowering blood pressure and thiazides lower systolic blood pressure more than other classes of antihypertensive drugs.
<ABS> This review could not provide a valid estimate of short-term harms from all thiazide diuretics because there was incomplete reporting of metabolic effects (serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose, total cholesterol, low-density cholesterol and triglycerides) and the number of participants who dropped out of the trials due to adverse drug effects.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension.
<OBJ> Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias.
<MaM> We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks.
<RES> The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg.
<RES> Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide.
<RES> We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes.
<RES> In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively.
<RES> Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide.
<RES> In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).
<RES> In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence).
<RES> We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar.
<RES> Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence).
<RES> Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers.
<RES> This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review.
<RES> Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.
<RES> These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide.
<RES> Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides.
<RES> There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data.
<RES> This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect.
<CON> The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively.
<CON> For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more.
<CON> Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg.
<CON> This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria.
<CON> Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome.
<CON> Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> General anaesthesia requires multiple agent administration to achieve unconsciousness (hypnotics), muscle relaxation, analgesia and haemodynamic control.
<ABS> Many anaesthesiologists rely on clinical signs alone to guide anaesthetic management.
<ABS> We systematically reviewed 36 randomized controlled studies to find out whether BIS could reduce the risk of intraoperative awareness and reduce anaesthetic use and recovery times in adult surgical patients.
<ABS> The risk of intraoperative awareness was determined in selected patients who were at potentially high risk for awareness.
<ABS> Four studies (7761 patients) that used clinical signs as a guide to anaesthetic administration in standard practice, as the control group, demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of awareness with BIS monitoring.
<ABS> Four studies (26,530 patients) compared BIS monitoring with end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as a guide to management of anaesthesia and they did not demonstrate any difference in terms of intraoperative awareness.
<ABS> There was an overall reduction in volatile anaesthetic dose and the dose of propofol in the BIS group.
<ABS> Recovery from anaesthesia was quicker and postanaesthesia recovery care unit stay was shorter.
<ABS> The limitations of some of the clinical trials on BIS are discussed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The use of clinical signs may not be reliable in measuring the hypnotic component of anaesthesia.
<INT> The use of bispectral index (BIS) to guide the dose of anaesthetic may have certain advantages over clinical signs.
<INT> This is the second update of a review originally published in 2007.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1990 to 31 January 2013), EMBASE (1990 to 31 January 2013) and reference lists of articles.
<MaM> Previously, we searched to May 2009.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial quality, extracted data and analysed the data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for further details.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 36 trials.
<RES> In studies using clinical signs as standard practice, the results demonstrated a significant effect of the BIS-guided anaesthesia in reducing the risk of intraoperative awareness among surgical patients at high risk for awareness (7761 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.48).
<RES> This effect was not demonstrated in studies using end tidal anaesthetic gas (ETAG) monitoring as standard practice (26,530 participants; OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 2.26).
<RES> BIS-guided anaesthesia reduced the requirement for propofol by 1.32 mg/kg/hr (672 participants; 95% CI -1.91 to -0.73) and for volatile anaesthetics (desflurane, sevoflurane, isoflurane) by 0.65 minimal alveolar concentration equivalents (MAC) (95% CI -1.01 to -0.28) in 985 participants.
<RES> BIS shortened the duration of postanaesthesia care unit stay by 6.75 min (1953 participants; 95% CI -11.20 to -2.31) but did not significantly reduce the time to home readiness (329 participants; -7.01 min, 95% CI -30.11 to 16.09).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> BIS-guided anaesthesia and ETAG-guided anaesthesia may be equivalent in protection against intraoperative awareness but the evidence for this is inconclusive.
<CON> In addition, anaesthesia guided by BIS kept within the recommended range improves anaesthetic delivery and postoperative recovery from relatively deep anaesthesia.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This updated review examined whether light therapy is effective in improving cognition, ADLs, sleep, challenging behaviour, and psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia.
<ABS> Data from 11 trials were included in the analyses.
<ABS> Rest-activity and sleep-wake cycles are controlled by the inborn daily rhythm generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus.
<ABS> Changes in the SCN appear to be the biological basis for changes in sleep patterns in people with dementia and might be reversed by stimulation of the SCN by light.
<ABS> The light sources in the included studies were a light box placed approximately one metre away from the participants at a height within their visual fields; a light visor worn on their heads; ceiling mounted light fixtures; or dawn-dusk simulation that mimics outdoor twilight transitions.
<ABS> There was no effect of bright light therapy on cognitive function, sleep, agitation, or psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia.
<ABS> The results for a single outcome in a single study, which found a beneficial effect on ADLs, should be regarded with caution and need to be replicated before they could form the basis of a recommendation for the use of bright light therapy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Rest-activity and sleep-wake cycles are controlled by the endogenous circadian rhythm generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 20 January 2014 using the terms: "bright light*", "light box*", "light visor*", "dawn-dusk*", phototherapy, "photo therapy", "light therapy" "light treatment", light* .
<MaM> The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major healthcare databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trials databases and grey literature sources.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Included were people with dementia of any type and degree of severity.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance, and four review authors independently assessed the selected studies for risk of bias and extracted the data.
<MaM> Statistically significant differences in outcomes between the treatment and control groups at the end of treatment and follow-up were examined.
<MaM> Each study was summarized using a measure of effect (for example mean difference).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials (13 articles) met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> However, three of the studies could not be included in the analyses either because the reported data could not be used in the meta-analysis or we were unable to retrieve the required data from the authors.
<RES> This updated review found no effect of light therapy on cognitive function, sleep, challenging behaviour (for example agitation), or psychiatric symptoms associated with dementia.
<RES> Reduction in the development of ADL limitations was reported in one study, at three of five time points, and light therapy was found to have an effect after six weeks and two years but not after one year.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to justify the use of bright light therapy in dementia.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Topical agents and dressings for fungating wounds

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fungating wounds sometimes occur in people with advanced cancer.
<ABS> Care usually aims to slow down disease progression, and improve quality of life by relieving the physical symptoms caused by the wounds (leakage, bad smell, pain and the risk of haemorrhage) by means of appropriate dressings and other applied treatments.
<ABS> There is also weak evidence to suggest that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing bad smell.
<ABS> There is very little evidence in this area of medicine, however, and what there is is insufficient to give clear directions to practice for improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms in people with fungating wounds.
<ABS> More research is needed in this area.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Fungating wounds arise from primary, secondary or recurrent malignant disease and are associated with advanced cancer.
<INT> A small proportion of patients may achieve healing following surgical excision, but treatment is usually palliative.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four trials involving 164 people were included.
<RES> One RCT in women with superficial breast lesions compared 6% miltefosine solution with placebo and found that miltefosine delayed tumour progression.
<RES> The study reported that the time to treatment failure was significantly longer in the miltefosine group (median 56 days) than in the placebo group (median 21 days) (p value 0.007, log-rank test).
<RES> A second trial compared topical metronidazole with placebo but the results up to the point of cross-over were not statistically significant.
<RES> A third trial compared the effect of foam dressings containing silver to foam dressings without silver and found that more patients experienced decreased malodour in the foam with silver group than in the foam alone group (p value=0.049).
<RES> The fourth trial compared the effect of manuka honey-coated dressings with nanocrystalline silver-coated dressings and found no statistically significant difference with regard to exudate, malodour and wound pain.
<RES> All trials, however, had methodological limitations.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is also weak evidence to suggest that foam dressings containing silver may be effective in reducing malodour.
<CON> There is insufficient evidence in this review to give a clear direction for practice with regard to improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms associated with fungating wounds.
<CON> More research is needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Dietary protein is needed for normal growth and development.
<ABS> The protein intake required for growth of the low birth weight infant has been estimated by the growth rate of the fetus to be 3.5 to 4.0 g/kg/d.
<ABS> Controlling the amount of protein given to low birth weight babies (less than 2.5 kg) fed with formula is important.
<ABS> Too much protein can raise blood urea and amino acid (phenylalanine) levels, and this may harm neurodevelopment.
<ABS> Too low protein intake may limit the growth of these infants.
<ABS> Based on increased body incorporation of nitrogen, this was associated with increased lean body mass.
<ABS> The present conclusion was based on six studies that changed only the protein content of the formula and was supported by three additional studies that made changes in other nutrients as well.
<ABS> No significant difference in the concentration of plasma phenylalanine was noted between infants fed high or low protein content formula.
<ABS> The review was limited in the conclusions made because differences in protein content among comparison groups in some of the individual trials were small and formulas differed substantially across studies; some studies included healthier and more mature premature infants.
<ABS> Study periods varied from eight days to two years, so information on long-term outcomes was limited.
<ABS> Existing research is not adequate to allow specific recommendations regarding formula with protein content that provides more than 4.0 g/kg/d.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine whether higher (≥ 3.0 g/kg/d) versus lower (< 3.0 g/kg/d) protein intake during the initial hospital stay of formula-fed preterm infants or low birth weight infants (< 2.5 kilograms) results in improved growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes without evidence of short- and long-term morbidity.
<OBJ> To examine the following distinctions in protein intake.
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> Low protein intake if the amount was less than 3.0 g/kg/d.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> High protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than 3.0 g/kg/d but less than 4.0 g/kg/d.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> Very high protein intake if the amount was equal to or greater than 4.0 g/kg/d.
<OBJ> If the reviewed studies combined alterations of protein and energy, subgroup analyses were to be carried out for the planned categories of protein intake according to the following predefined energy intake categories.
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> Low energy intake: less than 105 kcal/kg/d.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> Medium energy intake: greater than or equal to 105 kcal/kg/d and less than or equal to 135 kcal/kg/d.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> High energy intake: greater than 135 kcal/kg/d.
<OBJ> As the Ziegler-Fomon reference fetus estimates different protein requirements for infants based on birth weight, subgroup analyses were to be undertaken for the following birth weight categories.
<OBJ> 1. < 800 grams.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> 800 to 1199 grams.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> 1200 to 1799 grams.
<OBJ> 4.
<OBJ> 1800 to 2499 grams.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The standard search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.
<MaM> MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library) were searched.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies were excluded if infants received partial parenteral nutrition during the study period or were fed formula as a supplement to human milk.
<MaM> Studies in which nutrients other than protein also varied were added in a post-facto analysis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five studies compared low versus high protein intake.
<RES> Improved weight gain and higher nitrogen accretion were demonstrated in infants receiving formula with higher protein content while other nutrients were kept constant.
<RES> No significant differences were seen in rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or diarrhea.
<RES> One study compared high versus very high protein intake during and after an initial hospital stay.
<RES> Very high protein intake promoted improved gain in length at term, but differences did not remain significant at 12 weeks corrected age.
<RES> Three of the 24 infants receiving very high protein intake developed uremia.
<RES> A post-facto analysis revealed further improvement in all growth parameters in infants receiving formula with higher protein content.
<RES> No significant difference in the concentration of plasma phenylalanine was noted between high and low protein intake groups.
<RES> However, one study (Goldman 1969) documented a significantly increased incidence of low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores among infants of birth weight less than 1300 grams who received a very high protein intake (6 to 7.2 g/kg).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Higher protein intake (≥ 3.0 g/kg/d but < 4.0 g/kg/d) from formula accelerates weight gain.
<CON> However, limited information is available regarding the impact of higher formula protein intake on long-term outcomes such as neurodevelopmental abnormalities.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Neutropenia (low white blood cell count) is a complication of cancer chemotherapy that exposes patients to life-threatening infections.
<ABS> Current practice for neutropenic patients with fever is hospital admission and treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
<ABS> Febrile neutropenia encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and low risk patients may be treated less aggressively.
<ABS> This review of randomised controlled trials showed comparable death and failure rates for oral and intravenous antibiotics for low risk patients, those with solid tumours or chronic leukaemia or lymphoma, and independent of age, source of infection and severity of the neutropenia.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Fever occurring in a neutropenic patient remains a common life-threatening complication of cancer chemotherapy.
<INT> Oral therapy could be an alternative approach for selected patients.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 1) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to January week 4, 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 4) and LILACS (1982 to 2007).
<MaM> We searched several databases for ongoing trials.
<MaM> We checked the conference proceedings of the Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) (1995 to 2007), and all references of included studies and major reviews were scanned.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for dichotomous data.
<MaM> Risk of bias assessment was also made in line with methodology of The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-two trials (3142 episodes in 2372 patients) were included in the analyses.
<RES> The mortality rate was similar when comparing oral to intravenous antibiotic treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.68, 9 trials, 1392 patients, median mortality 0, range 0% to 8.8%).
<RES> Treatment failure rates were also similar (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06, all trials).
<RES> No significant heterogeneity was shown for all comparisons but adverse events.
<RES> The effect was stable in a wide range of patients.
<RES> Quinolones alone or combined with another antibiotic were used with comparable results.
<RES> Adverse reactions, mostly gastrointestinal, were more common with oral antibiotics.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The wide CI for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for mortality, and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk patients.

<H1> Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Psychotic depression is a severe depression with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations).
<ABS> Uncertainty surrounds the most effective drug treatment for psychotic depression: with an antidepressant alone, with an antipsychotic alone or with the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic.
<ABS> The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression.
<ABS> We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated drug treatments for psychotic depression.
<ABS> We searched for these trials in a wide-ranging way.
<ABS> The search identified 3659 studies, but in the end, we found only 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> These trials involved a total of 929 people.
<ABS> From these trials, we found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic provides more effective treatment for psychotic depression than either treatment alone.
<ABS> However, our confidence in this conclusion is limited because the information came from only a small number of RCTs, which included small numbers of people.
<ABS> In addition, the types of people involved varied between RCTs, and the RCTs differed in design, which means that we cannot confidently generalise their findings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2005 and last updated in 2009.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> To compare the clinical efficacy of pharmacological treatments for patients with an acute psychotic depression: antidepressant monotherapy, antipsychotic monotherapy and the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic, compared with each other and/or with placebo.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> To assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode are related to non-response to prior treatment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) was carried out (to 12 April 2013).
<MaM> These registers include reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: EMBASE (1970-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1960-).
<MaM> Reference lists of all studies and related reviews were screened and key authors contacted.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
<MaM> Data were entered into RevMan 5.1.
<MaM> We used intention-to-treat data.
<MaM> For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated.
<MaM> For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs.
<MaM> Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review.
<RES> Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta-analyses were possible.
<RES> The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis.
<RES> We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic.
<RES> However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, P = 0.006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003).
<RES> Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Psychotic depression is heavily understudied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn.
<CON> Evidence is limited for treatment with an antidepressant alone or with an antipsychotic alone.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The benefits of post-birth parental education for infant health or care and parent-infant relationships remain unclear.
<ABS> Parenting is important in the development of healthy children.
<ABS> New parents have much to learn soon after the birth of an infant and parents do not always have social support or role models to follow.
<ABS> This makes it essential to examine the effectiveness of interventions used by health personnel to educate new parents about caring for their newborn infants in the best possible way.
<ABS> This review sought to assess educational programs delivered to one or both parents individually or in a group in the first two months after birth.
<ABS> Although the review identified 27 trials involving 3949 mothers and 579 fathers, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) provided useable data on outcomes of interest.
<ABS> Infant sleep, crying, and maternal knowledge of infant behaviours were the only outcomes that could be effectively analyzed.
<ABS> Results showed that educational interventions aimed at sleep enhancement increased the amount of infant sleep by an average of 29 minutes in 24 hours but had no significant effect on the average infant crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age.
<ABS> Education on infant behaviour increased mothers' knowledge of infant behaviour four weeks after birth by an average of 2.85 points.
<ABS> Further research is required.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the 27 trials (3949 mothers and 579 fathers) that met the inclusion criteria, only 15 (2922 mothers and 388 fathers) reported useable data.
<RES> Educational interventions included: five on infant sleep enhancement, 12 on infant behaviour, three on general post-birth health, three on general infant care, and four on infant safety.
<RES> Details of the randomization procedures, allocation concealment, blinding, and participant loss were often not reported.
<RES> Of the outcomes analyzed, only 13 were measured similarly enough by more than one study to be combined in meta-analyses.
<RES> Of these 13 meta-analyses, only four were found to have a low enough level of heterogeneity to provide an overall estimate of effect.
<RES> Education about sleep enhancement resulted in a mean difference of 29 more night-time minutes of infant sleep in 24 hours at six weeks of age (95% confidence interval (CI) 18.53 to 39.73) than usual care.
<RES> However, it had no significant effect on the mean difference in minutes of crying time in 24 hours at six weeks and 12 weeks of age.
<RES> Education related to infant behaviour increased maternal knowledge of infant behaviour by a mean difference of 2.85 points (95% CI 1.78 to 3.91).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The benefits of educational programs to participants and their newborns remain unclear.
<CON> Education related to sleep enhancement appears to increase infant sleep but appears to have no effect on infant crying time.
<CON> Education about infant behaviour potentially enhances mothers' knowledge; however more and larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> What are the effects of thyroid hormone treatment (levothyroxine) and minimally invasive procedures on benign thyroid nodules?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Nodules (lumps) within the thyroid gland are common and usually benign.
<ABS> They are more frequent in women, the elderly and in iodine-deficient areas.
<ABS> Thyroid nodules are often observed as an incidental finding in the course of ultrasonography of the thyroid, nodules of more than 1 cm in size are usually detected by palpation of the thyroid gland during a physical examination.
<ABS> Thyroid nodules may occur as a single nodule or as multiple nodules and may contain fluid (cyst).
<ABS> About 5 in 100 palpable thyroid nodules have a risk of becoming malignant (thyroid cancer).
<ABS> Thyroid nodules are often treated with thyroid hormones in order to reduce the size of the nodule.
<ABS> If thyroid nodules cause problems such as pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints, surgery may be performed.
<ABS> Other therapies try to destroy the thyroid nodule by means of minimally invasive procedures (techniques which are less invasive than open surgery) and are usually performed on an outpatient basis.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 31 randomised controlled trials for this systematic review.
<ABS> Altogether 2952 participants were allocated to the various intervention and comparator groups.
<ABS> In total, 16 studies lasting six months to five years investigated the effects of levothyroxine therapy.
<ABS> Eight studies lasting 1 to 12 months investigated the efficacy of injections, mostly of ethanol, into thyroid nodules from which fluid had been slowly removed.
<ABS> Laser therapy (one or up to three sessions) was applied to nodules in five studies lasting 6 to 12 months.
<ABS> Two studies investigated the application of one or two radiofrequency (high-frequency radiowaves) sessions over 6 to 12 months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> None of the interventions investigated death from any cause, the development of thyroid cancer or health-related quality of life.
<ABS> Nodule volume reductions were achieved by all therapies; however, the clinical relevance of this outcome is doubtful.
<ABS> Minimally invasive treatments resulted in improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints.
<ABS> Some side effects such as light-to-moderate pain were observed after minimally invasive procedures.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most study results were of overall low quality, mainly because only a few people were investigated, findings were imprecise or measurements were prone to bias.
<ABS> Future studies should investigate more patient-important outcomes, such as health-related quality of life, and should compare minimally invasive therapies with surgery.
<ABS> Studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, death from any cause and long-term side effects of treatments.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of April 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Thyroid nodules (TN) are common in the adult population.
<INT> Some physicians use suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) therapy to achieve a reduction in the number and volume of TN.
<INT> However, the risk to benefit ratio of all treatments for benign TN is currently unknown.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified studies from computerised searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS (all performed up to April 2014).
<MaM> We also searched trial registers, examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted study authors.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included studies if they were RCTs of LT4, PEI, LP, RF, HIFU or MW therapy in participants with an established diagnosis of benign TN.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument.
<MaM> We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic.
<MaM> We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-one studies randomised 2952 outpatients to investigate the effects of different therapies on benign TN.
<RES> Studies on LT4, PEI, LP and RF ablation therapy randomised 2083, 607, 192 and 70 participants, respectively.
<RES> We found no RCTs of HIFU or MW ablation therapy in benign TN.
<RES> The duration of treatment varied according to the applied therapies: up to five years for LT4 and one to three PEI ablations, one to three LP sessions and one or two RF sessions.
<RES> Median follow-up was 12 months for LT4 and six months for minimally invasive therapies.
<RES> Evidence was of low-to-moderate quality, and risk of performance and detection bias for subjective outcomes was high in most trials.
<RES> No study evaluated all-cause mortality or health-related quality of life.
<RES> Only one LT4 study provided some data on the development of thyroid cancer, reporting no abnormal cytological findings.
<RES> One LP study provided limited information on costs of treatment.
<RES> LT4 compared with no treatment or placebo was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 16% compared with 10% of participants after 6 to 24 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 2.38); P = 0.03; 958 participants; 10 studies; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Pressure symptoms or cosmetic complaints were not investigated in LT4 studies.
<RES> LT4 therapy was generally well tolerated: three studies provided quantitative data on signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which were observed in 25% of LT4-treated versus 7% of placebo-treated participants at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (269 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> PEI compared with cyst aspiration only was associated with a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in 83% compared with 44% of participants after 1 to 24 months of follow-up (RR 1.83 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.54); P = 0.0003; 105 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).
<RES> Improvements in neck compression symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up were seen in 78% of participants receiving PEI versus 38% of those in comparator groups.
<RES> No reliable summary effect estimate could be established, RR ranged from 1.0 to 3.06 in favour of PEI (370 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> In all trials, participants experienced periprocedural cervical tenderness and light-to-moderate pain usually lasting from minutes to several hours.
<RES> As a result of the PEI procedure, 26% of participants reported slight-to-moderate pain compared with 12% of those receiving cyst aspiration only (RR 1.78 (95% CI 0.62 to 5.12); P = 0.28; 104 participants; 3 studies; low-quality evidence).
<RES> One study comparing LP with LT4 showed a nodule volume reduction of 50% or more in favour of LP after 12 months of follow-up in 33% of LP participants versus 0% of LT4 participants, respectively (62 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence).
<RES> A total of 82% of LP-treated versus 0% of untreated participants showed improvements in pressure symptoms after 6 to 12 months of follow-up (RR 26.65 (95% CI 5.47 to 129.72); P < 0.0001; 92 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> Around 20% of LP-treated participants reported light-to-moderate cervical pain lasting 48 hours or more (97 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence).
<RES> One trial with 40 participants, comparing RF with no treatment, resulted in a mean nodule volume reduction of 76% in the RF group compared with 0% of those in the no-treatment group at six months of follow-up (low-quality evidence).
<RES> These RF-treated participants had fewer pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints after 12 months of follow-up compared with untreated participants (a 2.8 decrease versus a 1.1 increase on a six-point scale, respectively, with higher values indicating more severe symptoms; low-quality evidence).
<RES> All participants complained of pain and discomfort during RF, which disappeared when the energy was reduced or turned off (low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No study evaluated all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life or provided systematic data on the development of thyroid cancer.
<CON> Longest follow-up was five years and median follow-up was 12 months.
<CON> Nodule volume reductions were achieved by PEI, LP and RF, and to a lesser extent, by LT4.
<CON> However, the clinical relevance of this outcome measure is doubtful.
<CON> PEI, LP and RF led to improvements in pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints.
<CON> Adverse events such as light-to-moderate periprocedural pain were seen after PEI, LP and RF.
<CON> Future studies should focus on patient-important outcome measures, especially health-related quality of life, and compare minimally invasive procedures with surgery.
<CON> RCTs with follow-up periods of several years and good-quality observational studies are needed to provide evidence on the development of thyroid cancer, all-cause mortality and long-term adverse events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review Questions
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to cause regression and prevent the progression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to cervical cancer.
<ABS> We found only two small studies.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cervical pre-cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: CIN) can progress to invasive cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb).
<ABS> CIN is identified by screening and can be treated with surgery to the cervix, either with destruction of the cells covering the cervix, such as with laser therapy, heating, or freezing, or removal by surgical excision.
<ABS> While this is effective in the majority of cases, the surgery can cause immediate unwanted effects, such as bleeding and infection, or later complications including difficulty with menses due to scarring of the cervix and early (premature) labour.
<ABS> NSAIDs have been found to prevent the development of cancer of the large bowel and other organs, but with some unwanted side effects, especially on the heart and blood vessels.
<ABS> Although rofecoxib, used in one of these studies, was withdrawn from the market in 2004, it may shed light on the feasibility of treatment with other NSAIDs.
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether the use of NSAIDs for women with CIN could promote regression or prevent progression to cervical cancer without undue risk or side effects.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified two randomised studies, including 41 women over the age of 18 years, with moderate or severe CIN.
<ABS> The trials ran from June 2002 until October 2003 and between May 2004 and October 2004.
<ABS> One of them was discontinued before it was completed.
<ABS> The women were given either celecoxib or rofecoxib versus a placebo (sugar tablet) daily by mouth for a period of three to six months.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> There were far too few women involved in the trials to be able to show whether NSAIDs had a helpful effect in causing regression of CIN.
<ABS> No patients progressed to invasive cervical cancer, and no unwanted effects of the NSAID tablets were reported, but the number of women in the studies would have been too small to detect an adverse effect.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> While both studies appear to have been conducted well, there are some questions related to the quality of evidence in relation to concealment and women dropping out of the study before completion of assigned medications.
<ABS> There was insufficient information to assess accuracy of the reporting of information.
<ABS> It is possible that there are other incomplete and unreported studies that have not been identified.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> There is insufficient data at this time to support the use of NSAIDs to cause regression or prevent progression of CIN to cervical cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) precedes the development of invasive carcinoma of the cervix.
<INT> Effective treatment with medications, rather than surgery, would be beneficial.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (November, 2013) and EMBASE (November week 48, 2013).
<MaM> We also searched abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled trials of NSAIDs in the treatment of CIN.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risks of bias.
<MaM> Outcome data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In two RCTs, 41 women over the age of 18 years, in an outpatient setting, were randomised to receive celecoxib 200 mg twice daily by mouth for six months versus placebo (one study, 25 participants) or rofecoxib 25 mg once daily by mouth for three months versus placebo (one study, 16 participants).
<RES> This second study was discontinued early when rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in 2004.
<RES> The trials ran from June 2002 to October 2003, and May 2004 to October 2004.
<RES> We have chosen to include the data from the rofecoxib study as outcomes may be similar when other such NSAIDs are utilised.
<RES> Partial or complete regression of CIN 2 or 3 occurred in 11 out of 20 (55%) in the treatment arms and five out of 21 (23.8%) in the placebo arms (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 5.35; P value 0.04), very low quality evidence).
<RES> Complete regression of CIN 2 or 3 occurred in four of 12 (33%) of those receiving celecoxib versus two of 13 (15%) of those receiving placebo (RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.48 to 9.76; P value 0.31, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Partial regression of CIN 2 or 3 occurred in five of 12 (42%) of those receiving celecoxib versus two of 13 (15%) of those receiving placebo (RR 2.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.43; P value 0.18), very low quality evidence).
<RES> Progression to a higher grade of CIN, but not to invasive cancer, occurred in one of 12 (8%) of those receiving celecoxib and two of 13 (15%) receiving placebo (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.24; P value 0.4, very low quality evidence).
<RES> One study reported no cases of progression to invasive cancer within the timeframe of the study.
<RES> No toxicity was reported in either study.
<RES> Although the studies were well conducted and randomised, some risk of bias was detected in both studies.
<RES> Furthermore, the duration of the studies was short, which may mask identifying progression to cancer.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Results from a large on-going randomised study of celecoxib are awaited.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Trust is a fundamental part of a patient-doctor relationship, and is associated with increased patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care, although blind trust may on occasion facilitate poor care.
<ABS> We wished to know if there are effective ways of enhancing patient trust in doctors, by involving doctors (e.g. training) or patients (e.g. by providing information).
<ABS> We searched a wide variety of databases on 18 March 2013 and identified 10 diverse studies, all randomised controlled clinical trials, with 11,063 participants, that met the review's inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Seven of the trials were new for this update.
<ABS> Overall, they did not provide sufficient evidence that a specific intervention affects trust.
<ABS> All were undertaken in the United States.
<ABS> Two were government funded, while seven were funded by charitable trusts and one by a Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO).
<ABS> Interventions were of three main types; three employed additional physician training, four were education for patients and three provided additional information about doctors in terms of financial incentives or consulting style.
<ABS> Two trialled physician training interventions to improve behaviours known to be associated with trust.
<ABS> The interventions showed no change in the patients' trust in their physician.
<ABS> The third trial showed that training oncologists in communication skills resulted in a small increase in trust.
<ABS> Two trials examined group educational visits for uninsured diabetic patients.
<ABS> The first showed a small increase in trust, but the second showed no changes in trust.
<ABS> Another trial examined the effects of three types of educational introductory visits on new patients' trust in the doctors working for their health organisation.
<ABS> Trust in the doctors rose with one type of visit, in which patients were seen as a group.
<ABS> However, this was the least well taken up compared with individual visits with a physician, or a physician and health educator.
<ABS> A further trial explored helping patients decide about taking a statin by providing information and a chance to discuss options.
<ABS> This did not significantly increase trust.
<ABS> Two trials explored disclosing to patients the incentives doctors are given for practising medicine in a cost-effective way via insurance plans.
<ABS> One trial led to no reduction and possibly an increase in trust.
<ABS> However, the plan information emphasised reducing unnecessary tests, rather than cost-cutting.
<ABS> The other trial showed no decrease in trust with disclosure.
<ABS> A final trial matched patients to doctors depending on their beliefs about care.
<ABS> Although some aspects of the doctor-patient relationship were improved, trust was not significantly affected.
<ABS> There was no evidence of harm from any of the studies.
<ABS> The review was constrained by the lack of consistency between trust measurements, timeframes and populations.
<ABS> We have highlighted the types of further trials that are required to explore the impact of doctors' specific training or the use of a patient-centred or decision-sharing approach on patients' trust.
<ABS> Particularly, there is a need for international studies over longer follow-up periods in different healthcare systems.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Trust is a fundamental component of the patient-doctor relationship and is associated with increased satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and continuity of care.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In 2003 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Health Star, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, African Trials Register, African Health Anthology, Dissertation Abstracts International and the bibliographies of studies selected for inclusion.
<MaM> We also contacted researchers active in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.
<MaM> Where mentioned, we extracted data on adverse effects.
<MaM> We synthesised data narratively.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 randomised controlled trials (including 7 new trials) involving 11,063 patients.
<RES> Additionally, several different measures of trust were employed.
<RES> The studies gave conflicting results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Overall, there remains insufficient evidence to conclude that any intervention may increase or decrease trust in doctors.
<CON> This may be due in part to the sensitivity of trust instruments, and a ceiling effect, as trust in doctors is generally high.
<CON> It may be that current measures of trust are insufficiently sensitive.
<CON> International trials would be of particular benefit.
<CON> The review was constrained by the lack of consistency between trust measurements, timeframes and populations.

<H1> Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of current screening programmes in detecting oral cancer at an early stage and whether or not they can assist in decreasing deaths due to oral cancer.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Oral cancer is increasing worldwide and it is the sixth most common cancer overall.
<ABS> The highest rates of oral cancer occur in the most disadvantaged sections of the population.
<ABS> Important risk factors in the development of the disease are tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and sunlight although a role for candida (which causes thrush) and the human papillomavirus (which causes warts) has also been documented.
<ABS> People who are heavy drinkers and also smoke have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared with people who do neither.
<ABS> These factors are considered to be especially important in the development of the disease in young people, a group experiencing an increasing incidence of the disease, particularly in countries with a high incidence of it.
<ABS> Geographic variation in the occurrence of oral cancer around the world is wide.
<ABS> For example it is the most common cancer for men in India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and 30% of all new cases of cancer in these countries is oral cancer whereas only 3% of new cases of cancer in the United Kingdom are oral cancer.
<ABS> Death rates from oral cancer and the negative effects of the disease are high and increasing rather than declining as for other cancers such as breast and colon.
<ABS> Prevention screening programmes for other cancers have proven to be effective in early detection.
<ABS> However, whilst there maybe advantages to screening there are disadvantages because screening has the potential to produce either false positive or false negative results.
<ABS> Screening can be targeted at high-risk groups, it can be opportunistic, for example when people attend health services for other reasons, or can be done by looking at statistics across the population as a whole.
<ABS> The aim of preventive screening for early detection of oral cancer is to screen individuals for pre-cancerous conditions which are lesions such as leukoplakia.
<ABS> The most common screening method is visual inspection by a clinician but other techniques include the use of a special blue dye, the use of imaging techniques and measuring biochemical changes to normal calls.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based is up to date as of 22 July 2013.
<ABS> The only study included was based in rural areas of the city of Trivandrum in Kerala, India.
<ABS> Screening took place in seven clusters (96,517 participants) and six clusters acted as a control (95,356 participants).
<ABS> Participants were excluded if they were bedridden, if they had open tuberculosis, other debilitating diseases or were already suffering from oral cancer.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review found that overall there is not enough evidence to decide whether screening by visual inspection reduces the death rate for oral cancer and there is no evidence for other screening methods.
<ABS> However, there is some evidence that it might help reduce death rates in patients who use tobacco and alcohol although the only included study may be affected by bias.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of low quality and limited to one study assessed as at high risk of bias.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common.
<INT> Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection.
<INT> Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population-based measure.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> There were no restrictions on language in the search of the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for dichotomous data.
<MaM> Meta-analyses would have been undertaken using a random-effects model if the number of studies had exceeded a minimum of three.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted where possible and where deemed necessary for missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 3239 citations were identified through the searches.
<RES> Only one RCT, with 15-year follow-up met the inclusion criteria (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in the oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (15.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (17.1/100,000 person-years), with a RR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.12).
<RES> A 24% reduction in mortality was reported between the screening group (30/100,000 person-years) and the control group (39.0/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97).
<RES> No statistically significant differences were found for incidence rates.
<RES> A statistically significant reduction in the number of individuals diagnosed with stage III or worse oral cancer was found for those in the screening group (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93).
<RES> No harms were reported.
<RES> The study was assessed as at high risk of bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The review question was intended to look at three options for this treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Sometimes there is not enough bone in the upper jaw in which to secure dental implants.
<ABS> Sometimes bone is taken from somewhere else in the person's body, or bone substitutes are used.
<ABS> An alternative approach is to place one to three long screw-shaped implants into the sinus and the cheekbone (zygomatic implants).
<ABS> This may mean that bone grafting is unnecessary.
<ABS> The implants can then be used to build and secure artificial teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A search was done on 17 June 2013 and the review team found no trials comparing the outcomes of zygomatic implants with conventional bone grafting.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There are no comparative trials evaluating the effectiveness of long implants passing through the sinus and into the cheekbone as an alternative to bone augmentation procedures.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Not applicable.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Dental implants are used for replacing missing teeth.
<INT> Placing dental implants is limited by the presence of adequate bone volume permitting their anchorage.
<INT> Several bone augmentation procedures have been developed to solve this problem.
<INT> Zygomatic implants are long screw-shaped implants developed as a partial or complete alternative to bone augmentation procedures for the severely atrophic maxilla.
<INT> Another specific indication for zygomatic implants could be maxillary reconstruction after maxillectomy in cancer patients.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 17 June 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 17 June 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 17 June 2013).
<MaM> Personal contacts and all known zygomatic implant manufacturers were contacted to identify unpublished trials.
<MaM> No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors would have extracted data from eligible studies and assessed their risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> The results of included studies were to be combined in meta-analyses using random-effects models where there were more than four studies, and fixed-effect models where there were less than four studies.
<MaM> We would have expressed the estimate of the intervention effect as mean difference for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals.
<MaM> Heterogeneity was to be investigated including both clinical and methodological factors.

<H1> Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The abdominal aorta is a major blood vessel in the body that carries blood from the heart to the major organs in the chest and abdomen.
<ABS> An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a balloon-like bulge (dilation) of the aorta that is greater than 3 cm in diameter.
<ABS> If an AAA ruptures (bursts), this is often fatal.
<ABS> Hence, AAAs that are larger than 5.5 cm are usually treated surgically in order to try to prevent such a rupture.
<ABS> Traditionally, AAAs are treated using an open surgical repair (OSR) technique, in which the abdomen is cut open (referred to as open surgery) and the dilated aorta is repaired using fabric graft material.
<ABS> Once in the correct position, a sheath is introduced that acts to reline the dilated aorta, acting as an artifical blood vessel through which blood can continue to flow, bypassing the aneurysm.
<ABS> As EVAR is a less invasive technique than OSR, in that there is no need for open surgery, it may have advantages over OSR.
<ABS> In addition, some individuals with other medical illnesses, for whom open surgery may be considered a high-risk procedure and who are not fit for OSR, can be offered EVAR instead.
<ABS> The review authors identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of good quality that compared OSR with EVAR, involving a combined total of 2790 participants considered fit for surgery, and one RCT of good quality that compared EVAR with no intervention, involving a total of 404 participants considered unfit for OSR.
<ABS> The pooled analysis of the four trials comparing OSR with EVAR showed that the death rates within 30 days of operation or during admission for surgery were significantly lower in individuals undergoing EVAR than in those undergoing OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%).
<ABS> However, there was no difference in death rates between the groups up to four years after the operation (intermediate follow up) or beyond four years (long-term follow up).
<ABS> Participants undergoing EVAR had a significantly higher incidence of a need for an additional intervention to deal with any complications of the procedure undertaken compared with those receiving OSR.
<ABS> Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the two procedures.
<ABS> However, there was a slightly higher incidence of lung complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group.
<ABS> The results of the one RCT comparing EVAR with no intervention in individuals considered unfit for OSR showed no difference in overall death rates and complication rates between the groups.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> An abnormal dilatation of the abdominal aorta is referred to as an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
<INT> Due to the risk of rupture, surgical repair is offered electively to individuals with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm in size.
<INT> Traditionally, conventional open surgical repair (OSR) was considered the first choice approach.
<INT> However, over the past two decades endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has gained popularity as a treatment option.
<INT> This article intends to review the role of EVAR in the management of elective AAA.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of EVAR versus conventional OSR in individuals with AAA considered fit for surgery, and EVAR versus best medical care in those considered unfit for surgery.
<OBJ> This was determined by the effect on short, intermediate and long-term mortality, endograft related complications, re-intervention rates and major complications.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (January 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2012, Issue 12).
<MaM> The TSC also searched trial databases for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three reviewers independently evaluated trials for appropriateness for inclusion and extracted data using pro forma designed by the Cochrane PVD Group.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of trials using The Cochrane Collaboration's 'Risk of bias' tool.
<MaM> We entered collected data in to Review Manager (version 5.2.3) for analysis.
<MaM> Where direct comparisons could be made, we determined odds ratios (OR).
<MaM> We tested studies for heterogeneity and, when present, we used a random-effects model; otherwise we used a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> We tabulated data that could not be collated.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four high-quality trials comparing EVAR with OSR (n = 2790) and one high-quality trial comparing EVAR with no intervention (n = 404) fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
<RES> In individuals considered fit for surgery, a pooled analysis, including 1362 individuals randomised to EVAR and 1361 randomised to OSR, found short-term mortality (including 30-day or inhospital mortality, excluding deaths prior to intervention) with EVAR to be significantly lower than with OSR (1.4% versus 4.2%, OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.55; P < 0.0001).
<RES> Using intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) there was no significant difference in mortality at intermediate follow-up (up to four years from randomisation), with 221 (15.8%) and 237 (17%) deaths in the EVAR (n = 1393) and OSR (n = 1390) groups, respectively (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12; P = 0.40).
<RES> There was also no significant difference in long-term mortality (beyond four years), with 464 (37.3%) deaths in the EVAR and 470 (37.8%) deaths in the OSR group (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; P = 0.78).
<RES> Similarly, there was no significant difference in aneurysm-related mortality between groups, either at the intermediate- or long-term follow up.
<RES> Studies showed that both EVAR and OSR were associated with similar incidences of cardiac deaths (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; P = 0.36) and fatal stroke rate (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55; P = 0.52).
<RES> The long-term reintervention rate was significantly higher in the EVAR group than in the OSR group (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.51; P = 0.02; I2 = 85%).
<RES> Results of the reintervention analysis should be interpreted with caution due to significant heterogeneity.
<RES> Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between the EVAR and OSR groups.
<RES> However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group compared with the EVAR group (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; P = 0.006).
<RES> In individuals considered unfit for conventional OSR, the one included trial found no difference between the EVAR and no-intervention groups with regard to all-cause mortality at final follow up, with 21.0 deaths per 100 person-years in the EVAR group and 22.1 deaths per 100 person years in the no-intervention group (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with EVAR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27; P = 0.97).
<RES> Aneurysm-related deaths were, however, significantly higher in the no-intervention group than in the EVAR group (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.89; P = 0.02).
<RES> There was no difference in myocardial events (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.91) between the groups in this study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In individuals considered fit for conventional surgery, EVAR was associated with lower short-term mortality than OSR.
<CON> Individuals undergoing EVAR had a higher reintervention rate than those undergoing OSR.
<CON> Most of the reinterventions undertaken following EVAR, however, were catheter-based interventions associated with low mortality.
<CON> Operative complications, health-related quality of life and sexual dysfunction were generally comparable between EVAR and OSR.
<CON> However, there was a slightly higher incidence of pulmonary complications in the OSR group than in the EVAR group.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute pain is often felt soon after injury.
<ABS> Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards.
<ABS> People with pain are used to test pain killers.
<ABS> They have often had wisdom teeth removed.
<ABS> The pain is often treated with pain killers given by mouth.
<ABS> Results can then be applied to other forms of acute pain.
<ABS> A series of reviews has looked at how good pain killers are.
<ABS> This review looked at a drug called celecoxib.
<ABS> Celecoxib is most often used for chronic pain caused by arthritis and is one of a group of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
<ABS> When used for a long time, celecoxib has fewer side effects associated with the digestive system than other NSAIDs.
<ABS> This review assessed information from 10 studies which used celecoxib for acute pain.
<ABS> Just over 3 in 10 people (33%) taking celecoxib 200 mg, and over 4 in 10 (43%) taking celecoxib 400 mg, experienced good pain relief (at least 50%) compared to about 1 in 10 (range 1% to 11%) with placebo.
<ABS> Comparing the results of the different studies showed that the 200 mg dose of celecoxib was at least as good as aspirin 600 to 650 mg and paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1000 mg for relieving postoperative pain, while a 400 mg dose was at least as good as ibuprofen 400 mg.
<ABS> One serious adverse event, muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), was probably related to celecoxib.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2008, and updated in Issue 3, 2012.
<INT> Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor usually prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
<INT> Celecoxib is believed to be associated with fewer upper gastrointestinal adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
<INT> Its effectiveness in acute pain was demonstrated in the earlier reviews.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov.
<MaM> The most recent search was to 31 May 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors assessed studies for quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We converted summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) into dichotomous information, yielding the number of participants with at least 50% pain relief over four to six hours.
<MaM> We used information on use of rescue medication to calculate the proportion of participants requiring rescue medication and the weighted mean of the median time to use.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies (1785 participants) met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> The two new studies in this update had been identified in the earlier update, but data were not available.
<RES> There remain three potentially relevant unpublished studies for which data are not available at this time.
<RES> The NNT for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg compared with placebo for at least 50% of maximum pain relief over four to six hours was 4.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 5.6) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.3 to 3.0) respectively.
<RES> The median time to use of rescue medication was 6.6 hours with celecoxib 200 mg, 8.4 hours with celecoxib 400 mg, and 2.3 hours with placebo.
<RES> The proportion of participants requiring rescue medication over 24 hours was 74% with celecoxib 200 mg, 63% for celecoxib 400 mg, and 91% for placebo.
<RES> The NNT to prevent one patient using rescue medication was 4.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 7.7) and 3.5 (95% CI 2.9 to 4.6) for celecoxib 200 mg and 400 mg respectively.
<RES> Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and were experienced by a similar proportion of participants in the celecoxib and placebo groups.
<RES> One serious adverse event that was probably related to celecoxib was reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Single-dose oral celecoxib is an effective analgesic for postoperative pain relief.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Opioids for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are effective in the management of breakthrough pain.
<ABS> Breakthrough pain is an additional sudden brief pain that occurs despite taking regularly scheduled doses of pain medication.
<ABS> It is a common and debilitating component of pain in patients with cancer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We sought clinical trial evidence to determine the effectiveness of opioids in relieving breakthrough pain and the incidence of side effects in cancer patients.
<ABS> The evidence is current to 6 February 2013.
<ABS> We identified 15 trials and included 1699 participants.
<ABS> The identified studies examined the use of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate (an opioid medicine that relieves pain administered across the mucous membrane of either the mouth or nose) in breakthrough pain in cancer patients taking regularly scheduled opioids.
<ABS> Most studies measured similar outcomes.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Available data suggest that both oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate are safe and effective (compared with both placebo and morphine) in relieving breakthrough pain.
<ABS> The side effect profiles of oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate were similar to other opioids.
<ABS> Recommendations are made about future clinical trials.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We could wish for more consistency in study design and more studies comparing the oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl citrate formulations to one another.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 1, 2006).
<INT> Breakthrough pain has traditionally been managed by the administration of supplemental oral analgesia (rescue medication) at a dose proportional to the total around-the-clock (ATC) opioid dose.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of opioids used as rescue medication against active or placebo comparator in patients with cancer pain.
<MaM> Outcome measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of life.
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected and examined eligible studies.
<MaM> We conducted quality assessment and data extraction using standardised data forms.
<MaM> We compared drug and placebo dose, titration, route and formulation and recorded details of all outcome measures (if available).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The original review included four studies (393 participants), all concerned with the use of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) in the management of breakthrough pain.
<RES> Two studies examined the titration of OTFC, one study compared OTFC versus normal-release morphine and one study compared OTFC versus placebo.
<RES> Fifteen studies (1699 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this update.
<RES> All studies reported on the utility of seven different transmucosal fentanyl formulations, five of which were administered orally and two nasally.
<RES> Eight studies compared the transmucosal fentanyl formulations versus placebo, four studies compared them with another opioid, one study was a comparison of different doses of the same formulation and two were randomised titration studies.
<RES> Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl formulations were an effective treatment for breakthrough pain.
<RES> When compared with placebo or oral morphine, participants gave lower pain intensity and higher pain relief scores for transmucosal fentanyl formulations at all time points.
<RES> Global assessment scores also favoured transmucosal fentanyl preparations.
<RES> One study compared intravenous with the transmucosal route and both were effective.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Oral and nasal transmucosal fentanyl is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough pain.
<CON> The RCT literature for the management of breakthrough pain is relatively small.
<CON> Given the importance of this subject, more trials, including head-to-head comparisons of the available transmucosal fentanyl formulations are required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hormonal types of birth control are used by many women worldwide.
<ABS> The most common hormonal methods are birth control pills and injections.
<ABS> These methods often do not work as well as they could.
<ABS> Women may have problems using the birth control as planned.
<ABS> They may miss taking some pills.
<ABS> Other women may stop using a method due to bleeding changes.
<ABS> This review looked at whether more counseling or reminders helped women use these types of birth control.
<ABS> Through August 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials comparing special counseling with usual counseling.
<ABS> In addition, we looked at reference lists to find trials.
<ABS> We also wrote to researchers to find more studies.
<ABS> We found nine trials.
<ABS> Five studies counseled women about the method and its side effects.
<ABS> Four trials focused on reminders for appointments or pill-taking, but two also provided health information.
<ABS> Three trials showed some positive results.
<ABS> One study gave structured counseling about an injected type of birth control.
<ABS> More women who got the structured counseling kept using the birth control than women who had the usual counseling.
<ABS> Also, fewer women who had the structured counseling stopped using the birth control due to bleeding changes.
<ABS> Another study gave special counseling with or without follow-up calls.
<ABS> In the short-term, more women with counseling and phone calls said they took the birth control pills regularly than those without phone calls or those with usual care.
<ABS> The third study sent text-message reminders to cell phones about birth control pills plus health information.
<ABS> More women in the text-message group were still taking their pills at six months than women with standard care.
<ABS> Only three studies showed better results with the special counseling or reminders.
<ABS> Four trials had few women in them and six lost many women during the study.
<ABS> The studies had moderate quality data.
<ABS> To prevent pregnancy, women should use birth control as planned and should keep using it.
<ABS> More trials of good quality are needed to learn how to help women use their birth control method.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Worldwide, hormonal contraceptives are among the most popular reversible contraceptives.
<INT> Despite their high theoretical effectiveness, typical use results in much lower effectiveness.
<INT> In large part, this disparity reflects difficulties in adherence to the contraceptive regimen and low rates for long-term continuation.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Sources included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP.
<MaM> Earlier searches also included LILACS, PsycINFO, Dissertation Abstracts, African Index Medicus, and IMEMR.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included RCTs of an intensive counseling technique or other client-provider intervention compared to routine family planning counseling.
<MaM> Outcome measures were discontinuation, reasons for discontinuation, number of missed pills or on-time injections, and pregnancy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One author evaluated the titles and abstracts from the searches to determine eligibility.
<MaM> Two authors extracted data from the included studies.
<MaM> We calculated the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes.
<MaM> For continuous variables, the mean difference (MD) was computed; RevMan uses the inverse variance approach.
<MaM> For all analyses, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also computed.
<MaM> Since the studies identified differed in both interventions and outcome measures, we did not conduct a meta-analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine RCTs met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> Five involved direct counseling; of those, two also provided multiple contacts by telephone.
<RES> Four other trials provided intensive reminders, two of which also provided health education information.
<RES> Three trials showed some benefit of the experimental intervention.
<RES> In a counseling intervention, women who received repeated structured information about the injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) were less likely to discontinue the method by 12 months (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.44) than women who had routine counseling.
<RES> The intervention group was also less likely to discontinue due to menstrual disturbances (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.37).
<RES> Another trial showed a group with special counseling plus phone calls was more likely than the special-counseling group to report consistent use of oral contraceptives (OC) at 3 months (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.87), though not at 12 months.
<RES> The group with only special counseling did not differ significantly from those with standard care for any outcome.
<RES> The third trial compared daily text-message reminders about OCs plus health information versus standard care.
<RES> Women in the text-message group were more likely than the standard-care group to continue OC use by six months (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.10).
<RES> The text-message group was also more likely to avoid an interruption in OC use longer than seven days (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.07).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Only three trials showed some benefit of strategies to improve adherence and continuation.
<CON> However, several had small sample sizes and six had high losses to follow up.
<CON> The overall quality of evidence was considered moderate.
<CON> The intervention type and intensity varied greatly across the studies.
<CON> A combination of intensive counseling and multiple contacts and reminders may be needed to improve adherence and acceptability of contraceptive use.
<CON> High-quality RCTs with adequate power and well-designed interventions could help identify ways to improve adherence to, and continuation of, hormonal contraceptive methods.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is: what is the optimal interval for dental check-ups (the time period between one dental check-up and the next)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The effects on oral health and the economic impact of altering the recall interval between different types of dental check-ups are unclear.
<ABS> Primary care dental practitioners in many countries have traditionally recommended dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 27 September 2013.
<ABS> This review includes one published study in which a total of 185 children and young adults were randomly chosen to have a clinical examination every 12 months or every 24 months.
<ABS> The study measured what effects the two different check-up times had on tooth decay and total time used per person (which could then be used to measure costs to the healthcare system).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The limited results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not extending the time to the next dental check-up can reduce tooth decay or costs.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of very low quality due to there only being one study and issues with the way it was conducted.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2007.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 27 September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 27 September 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 27 September 2013).
<MaM> We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials.
<MaM> Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of some papers were contacted to identify further trials and obtain additional information.
<MaM> We did not apply any restrictions regarding language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the search results against the inclusion criteria of the review, extracted data and carried out risk of bias assessment.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for clarification or further information where necessary and feasible.
<MaM> If we had found more than one study with similar comparisons reporting the same outcomes, we would have combined the studies in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model if there were at least four studies, or a fixed-effect model if there were less than four studies.
<MaM> We expressed the estimate of effect as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes.
<MaM> We would have used risk ratios with 95% CI for any dichotomous outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one study that analysed 185 participants.
<RES> The study compared the effects of a clinical examination every 12 months with a clinical examination every 24 months on the outcomes of caries (decayed, missing, filled surfaces (dmfs/DMFS) increment) and economic cost outcomes (total time used per person).
<RES> As the study was at high risk of bias, had a small sample size and only included low-risk participants, we rated the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes as very low.
<RES> For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the mean difference (MD) in dmfs increment was -0.90 (95% CI -1.96 to 0.16) in favour of 12-month recall.
<RES> For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD in DMFS increment was -0.86 (95% CI -1.75 to 0.03) also in favour of 12-month recall.
<RES> There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better caries outcomes.
<RES> For three to five-year olds with primary teeth, the MD in time used by each participant was 10 minutes (95% CI -6.7 to 26.7) in favour of 24-month recall.
<RES> For 16 to 20-year olds with permanent teeth, the MD was 23.7 minutes (95% CI 4.12 to 43.28) also in favour of 24-month recall.
<RES> This single study at high risk of bias represents insufficient evidence to determine whether 12 or 24-month recall with clinical examination results in better time/cost outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no evidence to support or refute the practice of encouraging patients to attend for dental check-ups at six-monthly intervals.
<CON> It is important that high quality RCTs are conducted for the outcomes listed in this review in order to address the objectives of this review.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preterm labour is when women go into labour before 37 weeks' gestation.
<ABS> Babies born before term (preterm birth) have poorer outcomes compared with babies who are born at term.
<ABS> The earlier the baby is born, the poorer the outcome.
<ABS> Most preterm births occur in low-income countries where medical help is less readily available.
<ABS> Preterm birth is a major cause of infant deaths and serious illness worldwide.
<ABS> Preterm birth can result in respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease, bleeding into the fluid spaces (ventricles) within the brain (intraventricular haemorrhage)), generalised infection or infection of the blood stream (sepsis), cerebral palsy and other neuro-developmental impairments.
<ABS> We assessed the benefits of betamimetics (drugs that inhibit contractions of the uterus) given to women with preterm labour against any adverse effects in randomised controlled trials.
<ABS> The betamimetics were administered, by any route or any dose, and compared with placebo, no treatment or other betamimetics.
<ABS> A total of 1367 women in preterm labour participated in the 12 trials that compared a betamimetic with placebo or no treatment.
<ABS> Betamimetics decreased the number of women giving birth within 48 hours and there was a decrease in the number of births within seven days.
<ABS> The delay in the timing of birth did not translate into any improvements in neonatal outcomes but most women in the trials were 32 weeks' gestation or more.
<ABS> Betamimetics were not shown to reduce perinatal deaths or respiratory distress syndrome.
<ABS> The side effects for the woman were considerable.
<ABS> These led to cessation of treatment and symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, headache, difficulty breathing, nausea and/or vomiting.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence from the included trials to suggest that one betamimetic agent was superior to another.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide.
<INT> Tocolytic agents are drugs used to inhibit uterine contractions.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of betamimetics given to women with preterm labour.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors assessed risk of bias and extracted the data independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-eight trials were assessed as eligible for inclusion in the review, but eight did not report any outcome data relevant to the review.
<RES> Results are based on the 20 trials that contributed data.
<RES> Twelve trials, involving 1367 women, compared betamimetics with placebo.
<RES> Betamimetics decreased the number of women in preterm labour giving birth within 48 hours (average risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.88, 10 trials, 1209 women).
<RES> There was a decrease in the number of births within seven days (average RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.98, five trials, 911 women) but there was no evidence of a reduction in preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation) (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03, 10 trials, 1212 women).
<RES> No benefit was demonstrated for betamimetics for perinatal death (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.55, 11 trials, 1332 infants), or neonatal death (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.27 to 3.00, six trials, 1174 infants).
<RES> No significant effect was demonstrated for respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.08, eight trials, 1239 infants).
<RES> A few trials reported on cerebral palsy, infant death and necrotising enterocolitis; no significant differences between groups were identified for any of these outcomes.
<RES> Betamimetics were significantly associated with the following outcomes: withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects; maternal chest pain; dyspnoea; palpitation; tremor; headaches; hypokalaemia; hyperglycaemia; nausea or vomiting; nasal stuffiness; and fetal tachycardia.
<RES> Nine trials compared different types of betamimetics.
<RES> Other betamimetics were compared with ritodrine in five trials (n = 948).
<RES> Other comparisons were examined in single trials: hexoprenaline compared with salbutamol (n = 140), slow versus moderate release salbutamol (n = 52) and salbutamol compared with terbutaline (n = 200).
<RES> Trials were small, varied, and of insufficient quality to delineate any consistent patterns of effect.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, multiple adverse effects must be considered.
<CON> The data are too few to support the use of any particular betamimetic.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Sometimes young adults and adults who are born with heart problems grow up and have depression.
<ABS> Treatments to help them other than anti-depressant drugs include psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies.
<ABS> Benefits of having treatment may include improved quality of life, and disadvantages of having treatment may include more severe depression and lower quality of life.
<ABS> Our objective was to update the previous review on the effects (both harms and benefits) of psychological interventions for treating depression in young adults and adults with congenital heart disease.
<ABS> Psychological interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or 'talking/counselling' therapy for depression.
<ABS> We updated the previous searches up to February 2013 and found no evidence from randomised controlled trials about the effects of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies for treating depression in adults or young adults born with heart disease.
<ABS> A well-designed randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the effects of psychological interventions for depression in congenital heart disease.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Adult and adolescent congenital heart disease is increasing in prevalence as better medical care means more children are surviving to adulthood.
<INT> People with chronic disease often also experience depression.
<INT> The aim of this review was to assess the effects of treatments such as psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapies and talking therapies for treating depression in this population.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Psychological interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, or 'talking/counselling' therapy for depression.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We did not search abstracts from national and international cardiology and psychology conferences and dissertation abstracts for this update.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts of studies that were potentially relevant to the review.
<MaM> We rejected studies that were clearly ineligible.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts or full papers for inclusion criteria.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Depression is common in people with congenital heart disease and can exacerbate the physical consequences of the illness.
<CON> There are effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression, but we have not been able to identify any trials showing the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments.
<CON> A well-designed randomised controlled trial is needed to assess the effects of psychological interventions for depression in congenital heart disease.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with nerve damage affecting the bladder may have incontinence (leakage of urine) or an inability to empty the bladder (voiding problem).
<ABS> This may cause infections or damage to the kidneys.
<ABS> Treatments include a permanent urinary catheter; using a catheter intermittently whenever the bladder needs to be emptied; an external sheath catheter fitted to the penis; or timed voiding, which involves regular emptying of the bladder at timed intervals.
<ABS> Although all these methods are used in practice, the review found that no randomised trials have been conducted to provide good evidence to suggest which is best and in which circumstances.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Options include intermittent urethral catheterisation, indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheterisation, timed voiding, use of external catheter (for men), drug treatment, augmentation cystoplasty and urinary diversion.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective was to determine the effects of different methods of managing long-term voiding problems (persisting after three months) with catheters in patients with neurogenic bladder.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Approximately 400 studies were scrutinised.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Despite a comprehensive search no evidence from randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials was found.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review Question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of music therapy in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
<ABS> We compared music therapy or music therapy in addition to standard care to no therapy, similar treatment without music ('placebo' therapy), or standard care.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People with ASD have difficulties with social interaction and communication.
<ABS> Music therapy uses musical experiences and the relationships that develop through them to enable people to relate to others, to communicate, and to share their feelings.
<ABS> In this way, music therapy addresses some of the core problems of people with ASD.
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether music therapy helps people with ASD compared to other alternatives.
<ABS> Study Characteristics
<ABS> We included 10 studies with a total number of 165 participants.
<ABS> The studies examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (one week to seven months) for children with ASD.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> Music therapy was superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care with respect to social interaction, non-verbal and verbal communicative skills, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity.
<ABS> Music therapy was also superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care in the areas of social adaptation, joy, and the quality of parent-child relationships.
<ABS> None of the included studies reported any side effects caused by music therapy.
<ABS> Quality of the Evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was moderate for social interaction outside of the therapy context, initiating behaviour, social adaptation, and the quality of the parent-child relationship, and low for the other three main outcomes (nonverbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context, verbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context, and social-emotional reciprocity).
<ABS> Reasons for limited quality of the evidence were issues with study design and small number of patients who participated in the studies.
<ABS> Authors' Conclusions
<ABS> Music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in important areas such as social interaction and communication.
<ABS> Music therapy may also contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships.
<ABS> Some of the included studies featured interventions that correspond well with treatment in clinical practice.
<ABS> More research with adequate design and using larger numbers of patients is needed.
<ABS> It is important to specifically examine how long the effects of music therapy last.
<ABS> The application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training.
<ABS> This is important when applying the results of this review to practice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The central impairments of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affect social interaction and communication.
<INT> The present version of this review on music therapy for ASD is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2006.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases in July 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and Dissertation Abstracts International.
<MaM> We also checked the reference lists of relevant studies and contacted investigators in person.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data from all included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 studies (165 participants) that examined the short- and medium-term effect of music therapy interventions (one week to seven months) for children with ASD.
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in non-verbal communicative skills outside of the therapy context (SMD 0.48, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.98, 3 RCTs, n = 57, low quality evidence).
<RES> Music therapy was also superior to 'placebo' therapy or standard care in secondary outcome areas, including social adaptation (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60, 4 RCTs, n = 26), joy (SMD 0.96, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.88, 1 RCT, n = 10), and quality of parent-child relationships (SMD 0.82, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.52, 2 RCTs, n = 33, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> None of the included studies reported any adverse effects.
<RES> The small sample sizes of the studies limit the methodological strength of these findings.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The findings of this updated review provide evidence that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their skills in primary outcome areas that constitute the core of the condition including social interaction, verbal communication, initiating behaviour, and social-emotional reciprocity.
<CON> Music therapy may also help to enhance non-verbal communication skills within the therapy context.
<CON> Furthermore, in secondary outcome areas, music therapy may contribute to increasing social adaptation skills in children with ASD and to promoting the quality of parent-child relationships.
<CON> In contrast to the studies included in an earlier version of this review published in 2006, the new studies included in this update enhanced the applicability of findings to clinical practice.
<CON> More research using larger samples and generalised outcome measures is needed to corroborate these findings and to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring.
<CON> When applying the results of this review to practice, it is important to note that the application of music therapy requires specialised academic and clinical training.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Malaria due to Plasmodium vivax parasites is widespread.
<ABS> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people with P. vivax malaria are treated with chloroquine for three days to eliminate the parasites in the blood that cause the symptoms of malaria, followed by 15 mg/day of primaquine for 14 days to treat the liver stage of the infection to prevent the disease recurring.
<ABS> However, many people do not complete the primaquine treatment once they feel better after chloroquine treatment.
<ABS> In addition, primaquine can destroy red blood cells in people with a genetic enzyme deficiency (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase enzyme (G6PD) deficiency), and clinicians avoid giving primaquine in areas where people commonly have this deficiency.
<ABS> Shorter courses of primaquine could potentially increase treatment completion and reduce adverse events.
<ABS> The review authors included 15 trials of 4377 adults and children older than one year with vivax malaria.
<ABS> All were treated with chloroquine for the blood stage infection, and then randomized to the 14-day primaquine course, or to shorter primaquine courses (three, five, or seven days); or to higher doses of primaquine given once a week for eight weeks; or to a placebo or no treatment.
<ABS> In twelve studies, treatments were supervised.
<ABS> The evidence is current to 8 October 2013.
<ABS> Relapse over six months to one year is probably higher with shorter regimens when compared to the standard 14-day primaquine regimen (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> We do not know from the available evidence whether the number of relapses with weekly primaquine differs from 14 days of primaquine treatment based on one study of 126 people followed up for nine months (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Better conducted studies on more people are needed to be sure that they are equally effective against relapse.
<ABS> Five days of primaquine was as ineffective against relapse as placebo or no treatment over six months to 15 months based on four studies (high quality evidence).
<ABS> The 14-day primaquine course prevented many more people relapsing with vivax malaria over 12 months than placebo (high quality evidence).
<ABS> No serious adverse reactions to primaquine were reported.
<ABS> This review update confirms that the 14-day primaquine course recommended by the WHO is more effective against relapse of vivax malaria than treatment with shorter courses of primaquine.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Plasmodium vivax infections are an important contributor to the malaria burden worldwide.
<INT> The World Health Organization recommends a 14-day course of primaquine (0.25 mg/kg/day, giving an adult dose of 15 mg/day) to eradicate the liver stage of the parasite and prevent relapse of the disease.
<INT> Many people find a 14-day primaquine regimen difficult to complete, and there is a potential risk of haemolytic anaemia in people with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase enzyme (G6PD) deficiency.
<INT> This review evaluates primaquine in P. vivax, particularly alternatives to the standard 14-day course.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to 8 October 2013.
<MaM> We checked conference proceedings, trial registries and reference lists and contacted researchers and pharmaceutical companies for eligible studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We independently assessed trial eligibility, trial quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data, and used the random-effects model in meta-analyses if there was significant heterogeneity.
<MaM> We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 15 trials (two cluster-RCTs) of 4377 adult and child participants.
<RES> Most trials excluded people with G6PD deficiency.
<RES> Trials compared various regimens of primaquine with the standard primaquine regimen, or with placebo or no treatment.
<RES> All trials treated blood stage infection with chloroquine.
<RES> Alternative primaquine regimens compared to 14-day primaquine
<RES> Relapse rates were higher over six months with the five-day primaquine regimen than the standard 14-day regimen (RR 10.05, 95% CI 2.82 to 35.86; two trials, 186 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Relapse with once-weekly supervised primaquine for eight weeks was little different over nine months follow-up compared to 14-day self-administered primaquine in one small study (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.34 to 25.87; one trial, 129 participants, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Primaquine regimens compared to no primaquine
<RES> The number of people that relapsed was similar between people given five days of primaquine or given placebo or no primaquine (four trials, 2213 participants, high quality evidence; follow-up six to 15 months); but lower with 14 days of primaquine (RR 0.6; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.75; ten trials, 1740 participants, high quality evidence; follow-up seven weeks to 15 months).
<RES> No serious adverse events were reported.
<RES> Treatment-limiting adverse events were rare and non-serious adverse events were mild and transient.
<RES> Trial authors reported that people tolerated the drugs.
<RES> We did not find trials comparing higher dose primaquine regimens (0.5 mg/kg/day or more) for five days or more with the 14-day regimen.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The analysis confirms the current World Health Organization recommendation for 14-day primaquine (15 mg/day) to prevent relapse of vivax malaria.
<CON> Shorter primaquine regimens at the same daily dose are associated with higher relapse rates.

<H1> Respite care for people with dementia and their carers

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Respite care for people with dementia and their carers

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review aims to see whether respite care can reduce caregiver burden and stress, and increase the length of time for which a person with dementia can continue living at home.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding.
<ABS> Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers and it is not clear what positive and negative effects such care may have on them, or on people with dementia.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Four studies with 753 participants were included in this review.
<ABS> Three compared respite care to no respite care and one compared respite care to polarity therapy, a type of touch therapy.
<ABS> All studies included people with dementia and their caregivers.
<ABS> We were not able to pool the results of the studies as there were so few studies and they measured the outcomes in different ways.
<ABS> All the studies reported outcomes for the caregiver, but only one reported outcomes for the person with dementia.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The three studies that compared respite care to no respite care found no evidence of any benefit of respite care for people with dementia or for their caregivers for any outcome, including rates of institutionalisation and caregiver burden.
<ABS> The study that compared respite care to polarity therapy found that polarity therapy decreased caregiver perceived stress but that there was no difference between polarity therapy and respite care for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> A host of methodological problems were identified in the available trials.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Caring for someone with dementia can be emotionally and physically demanding.
<INT> Respite care is any intervention designed to give rest or relief to caregivers.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors carried out study selection independently and reached a consensus through discussion.
<MaM> Data were extracted by a single review author.
<MaM> The review authors contacted all investigators for methodological details not reported in the text and for additional data for three studies included in the previous version of the review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four trials are now included in the review, with 753 participants.
<RES> They were different in many ways including the intervention, duration, outcomes and control group so pooling of data was not possible.
<RES> Overall, the quality of the evidence was rated as very low.
<RES> Re-analysis of outcomes using data from the published studies found no significant effects of respite care compared to no respite care on any caregiver variable.
<RES> When respite care was compared to polarity therapy a significant effect was found in favour of polarity therapy for caregiver perceived stress (n = 38, MD 5.80, 95% CI 1.43 to 10.17), but not for other measures of psychological health and other caregiver outcomes.
<RES> No studies reported evaluable data on outcomes related to the people with dementia.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Current evidence does not demonstrate any benefits or adverse effects from the use of respite care for people with dementia or their caregivers.
<CON> These results should be treated with caution, however, as they may reflect the lack of high quality research in this area rather than an actual lack of benefit.
<CON> Given the frequency with which respite care is advocated and provided, well-designed trials are needed in this area.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Tocolytic drugs suppress preterm labour and have the potential to postpone preterm birth long enough to, hopefully, improve infant outcome.
<ABS> This may be by allowing normal growth and maturation of the baby, or by allowing time for administration of magnesium sulphate to reduce risk of cerebral palsy and corticosteroids to help the baby's lungs and other organs to mature.
<ABS> Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORAs) are a group of tocolytic drugs, and we undertook this review to see if ORAs prolonged pregnancy and improved outcomes for infants compared with no treatment or with other tocolytic drugs.
<ABS> The tocolytic drugs, atosiban and barusiban, were the only ORAs we found that had been studied in trials; some trials compared with no treatment and others compared atosiban with betamimetics (another group of tocolytic drugs).
<ABS> We identified 14 studies, involving 2485 women.
<ABS> We found that, although atosiban resulted in fewer maternal side effects than other tocolytic drugs (especially betamimetics), atosiban was not effective in delaying or preventing preterm birth or improving neonatal outcome, and may possibly contribute to poorer infant outcomes.
<ABS> Further well-designed studies would be helpful, especially in women with threatened preterm at low gestations where preterm birth puts babies at particularly high risk of death or disability.
<ABS> Atosiban is no better than placebo or other drugs in delaying or preventing preterm birth but it has fewer maternal side effects compared to other tocolytics.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Preterm birth, defined as birth between 20 and 36 completed weeks, is a major contributor to perinatal morbidity and mortality globally.
<INT> Oxytocin receptor antagonists (ORA), such as atosiban, have been specially developed for the treatment of preterm labour.
<INT> ORA have been proposed as effective tocolytic agents for women in preterm labour to prolong pregnancy with fewer side effects than other tocolytic agents.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted trial data.
<MaM> When required, we sought additional data from trial authors.
<MaM> Results are presented as risk ratio (RR) for categorical and mean difference (MD) for continuous data with the 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Where appropriate, the number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) and the number needed to treat for harm (NNTH) were calculated.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review update includes eight additional studies (790 women), giving a total of 14 studies involving 2485 women.
<RES> Four studies (854 women) compared ORA (three used atosiban and one barusiban) with placebo.
<RES> Three studies were considered at low risk of bias in general (blinded allocation to treatment and intervention), the fourth study did not adequately blind the intervention.
<RES> No difference was shown in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.43; random-effects, (two studies, 152 women), perinatal mortality (RR 2.25, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.38; two studies, 729 infants), or major neonatal morbidity.
<RES> ORA (atosiban) resulted in a small reduction in birthweight (MD -138.86 g, 95% CI -250.53 to -27.18; two studies with 676 infants).
<RES> In one study, atosiban resulted in an increase in extremely preterm birth (before 28 weeks' gestation) (RR 3.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 9.51; NNTH 31, 95% CI 8 to 3188) and infant deaths (up to 12 months) (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.38 to 27.13; NNTH 28, 95% CI 6 to 377).
<RES> However, this finding may be confounded due to randomisation of more women with pregnancy less than 26 weeks' gestation to atosiban.
<RES> ORA also resulted in an increase in maternal adverse drug reactions requiring cessation of treatment in comparison with placebo (RR 4.02, 95% CI 2.05 to 7.85; NNTH 12, 95% CI 5 to 33).
<RES> No differences were shown in preterm birth less than 37 weeks' gestation or any other adverse neonatal outcomes.
<RES> No differences were evident by type of ORA, although data were limited.
<RES> Eight studies (1402 women) compared ORA (atosiban only) with betamimetics; four were considered of low risk of bias (blinded allocation to treatment and to intervention).
<RES> No statistically significant difference was shown in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; eight studies with 1389 women), very preterm birth (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.23; one study with 145 women), extremely preterm birth (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.92; one study with 244 women) or perinatal mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.48; three studies with 816 infants).
<RES> One study (80 women), of unclear methodological quality, showed an increase in the interval between trial entry and birth (MD 22.90 days, 95% CI 18.03 to 27.77).
<RES> No difference was shown in any reported measures of major neonatal morbidity (although numbers were small).
<RES> ORA (atosiban) resulted in less maternal adverse effects requiring cessation of treatment (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.11; NNTB 6, 95% CI 6 to 6; five studies with 1161 women).
<RES> Two studies including (225 women) compared ORA (atosiban) with calcium channel blockers (CCB) (nifedipine only).
<RES> The studies were considered as having high risk of bias as neither study blinded the intervention and in one study it was not known if allocation was blinded.
<RES> No difference was shown in birth less than 48 hours after trial entry (average RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.73, random-effects; two studies, 225 women) and extremely preterm birth (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.20 to 23.11; one study, 145 women).
<RES> No data were available for the outcome of perinatal mortality.
<RES> One small trial (145 women), which did not employ blinding of the intervention, showed an increase in the number of preterm births (before 37 weeks' gestation) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.14; NNTH 5, 95% CI 3 to 19), a lower gestational age at birth (MD -1.20 weeks, 95% CI -2.15 to -0.25) and an increase in admission to neonatal intensive care unit (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.47; NNTH 5, 95% CI 3 to 20).
<RES> ORA (atosiban) resulted in less maternal adverse effects (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.68; NNTB 6, 95% CI 5 to 12; two studies, 225 women) but not maternal adverse effects requiring cessation of treatment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.62; one study, 145 women).
<RES> No longer-term outcome data were included.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review did not demonstrate superiority of ORA (largely atosiban) as a tocolytic agent compared with placebo, betamimetics or CCB (largely nifedipine) in terms of pregnancy prolongation or neonatal outcomes, although ORA was associated with less maternal adverse effects than treatment with the CCB or betamimetics.
<CON> The finding of an increase in infant deaths and more births before completion of 28 weeks of gestation in one placebo-controlled study warrants caution.
<CON> However, the number of women enrolled at very low gestations was small.
<CON> Due to limitations of small numbers studied and methodological quality, further well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed.
<CON> Further comparisons of ORA versus CCB (which has a better side-effect profile than betamimetics) are needed.
<CON> Consideration of further placebo-controlled studies seems warranted.
<CON> Future studies of tocolytic agents should measure all important short- and long-term outcomes for women and infants, and costs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to compare the effectiveness of two commonly used painkillers, paracetamol and ibuprofen and the combination of both in a single tablet in the relief of pain following surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many patients need time off work and their quality of life is significantly affected.
<ABS> However, despite these consequences, people are often most concerned about pain following the operation which can be severe.
<ABS> It is suggested that the most intense pain is felt three to five hours after surgery.
<ABS> The pain experienced after oral surgery is widely used as a model to measure the effectiveness of painkillers in general.
<ABS> Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.
<ABS> In 2010, a new painkiller (marketed as Nuromol) containing paracetamol and ibuprofen in the same tablet was licensed for use in the United Kingdom.
<ABS> All the drugs studied in this review had minimal side effects noted when used correctly for short-term pain relief.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 20 May 2013.
<ABS> Seven studies with a total of 2241 participants all involving a direct comparison of ibuprofen to paracetamol or the combination of both were included in this review.
<ABS> All participants had surgery to remove a lower wisdom tooth or teeth that required bone removal or at least caused moderate to severe pain.
<ABS> Painkillers were taken after surgery and different doses of the drugs were compared.
<ABS> The majority of the studies took place in the USA with one in Puerto Rico.
<ABS> Four of the trials took place in clinical research facilities, two in university dental hospitals and one in a private oral surgery clinic.
<ABS> The age of participants differed slightly between studies but was broadly similar, ranging from 15 to 65 years old.
<ABS> All studies included male and female participants.
<ABS> All the studies included in this review looked only at pain relief and intensity information after a single dose of the painkiller after surgery.
<ABS> It is known that pain does continue after this and the drugs evaluated in this review are normally taken every six to eight hours (maximum of four times per day).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Ibuprofen is more effective than paracetamol at all doses studied in this review.
<ABS> On limited evidence, the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol appeared to be no more effective than the single drugs when measured two hours after surgery.
<ABS> However, again on limited evidence, it was found to be more effective than the drugs taken singly when measured at six hours after surgery.
<ABS> Participants taking the combined drug also had a smaller chance of requiring rescue medication.
<ABS> The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups.
<ABS> However, review authors could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> All of the results (outcomes) comparing ibuprofen to paracetamol are of high quality.
<ABS> This means that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimates of the effect.
<ABS> When comparing combined versus single drugs, the body of evidence for the proportion of patients with > 50% maximum pain relief (TOTPAR) over two and six hours, was assessed as of moderate quality due to imprecise estimates based on single studies.
<ABS> This means that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect.
<ABS> The body of evidence for the use of rescue medication was assessed as being of high quality.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Both paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used analgesics for the relief of pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth (third molars).
<INT> We have taken into account the side effect profile of the study drugs.
<INT> This review will help oral surgeons to decide on which analgesic to prescribe following wisdom tooth removal.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group'sTrials Register (to 20 May 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 4); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 20 May 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2013) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (to 20 May 2013).
<MaM> We checked the bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and review articles for further studies.
<MaM> We wrote to authors of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and searched personal references in an attempt to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs.
<MaM> No language restriction was applied to the searches of the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Only randomised controlled double-blinded clinical trials were included.
<MaM> Cross-over studies were included provided there was a wash out period of at least 14 days.
<MaM> All trials used the third molar pain model.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All trials identified were scanned independently and in duplicate by two review authors, any disagreements were resolved by discussion, or if necessary a third review author was consulted.
<MaM> The proportion of participants using rescue medication over both six and eight hours was also collated and compared.
<MaM> The number of patients experiencing adverse events or the total number of adverse events reported or both were analysed for comparison.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies were included, they were all parallel-group studies, two studies were assessed as at low risk of bias and three at high risk of bias; two were considered to have unclear bias in their methodology.
<RES> A total of 2241 participants were enrolled in these trials.
<RES> Ibuprofen was found to be a superior analgesic to paracetamol at several doses with high quality evidence suggesting that ibuprofen 400 mg is superior to 1000 mg paracetamol based on pain relief (estimated from TOTPAR data) and the use of rescue medication meta-analyses.
<RES> The risk ratio for at least 50% pain relief (based on TOTPAR) at six hours was 1.47 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 1.69; five trials) favouring 400 mg ibuprofen over 1000 mg paracetamol, and the risk ratio for not using rescue medication (also favouring ibuprofen) was 1.50 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.79; four trials).
<RES> The combined drug showed promising results, with a risk ratio for at least 50% of the maximum pain relief over six hours of 1.77 (95% CI 1.32 to 2.39) (paracetamol 1000 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg) (one trial; moderate quality evidence), and risk ratio not using rescue medication 1.60 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.88) (two trials; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The information available regarding adverse events from the studies (including nausea, vomiting, headaches and dizziness) indicated that they were comparable between the treatment groups.
<RES> However, we could not formally analyse the data as it was not possible to work out how many adverse events there were in total.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The majority of this evidence (five out of six trials) compared ibuprofen 400 mg with paracetamol 1000 mg, these are the most frequently prescribed doses in clinical practice.
<CON> The novel combination drug is showing encouraging results based on the outcomes from two trials when compared to the single drugs.

<H1> Routine scale and polish for periodontal health in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Routine scale and polish for periodontal health in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Scaling and polishing of the teeth may reduce deposits (plaque and calculus), as well as bleeding and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis).
<ABS> Over time a reduction in gingivitis (a milder form of gum disease) will reduce progression to periodontitis (a severe gum disease).
<ABS> This review examines the evidence for the effects of routine scale and polish treatment.
<ABS> It has been carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group to assess the benefits or otherwise of routine scale and polish treatments for healthy adults; to establish whether different time intervals between treatments influence these; to assess if the treatment is more effective if given together with instruction on how best to maintain healthy gums, and to compare the effectiveness of the treatment when given either by a dentist or by a dental therapist or hygienist.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many dentists or hygienists provide regular scaling and polishing for most patients at regular intervals even if they are considered to be at low risk of developing gum disease.
<ABS> There is debate about the clinical effectiveness of scaling and polishing and what is the best time interval between treatments.
<ABS> For the purposes of this review a 'routine scale and polish' is scaling and polishing of both the crown and root surfaces to remove deposits of (mainly) bacteria called plaque, and also hardened plaque known as calculus (tartar).
<ABS> Scaling or removal of hardened deposits is done with specially designed dental instruments or ultrasonic scalers and polishing is done mechanically with special pastes.
<ABS> In this review scaling above and below the gum level is included, however any surgical procedure on the gums, any chemical washing of the space between gum and tooth (pocket) and more intense (root planing) scraping of the root than simple scaling is excluded.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was correct as of 15 July 2013.
<ABS> Three trials with 836 participants were included in this review, ranging from 61 to 470 in each trial.
<ABS> Participants in two trials were adults aged 18 to 73, in the other trial young air force cadets.
<ABS> One study included patients attending three general dental practices for check-up appointments.
<ABS> Only patients with calculus or bleeding on probing and pockets between teeth and gums less than 3.5 mm were included.
<ABS> One study included young adult male US Air Force cadets and the other patients attending a dental school hygiene clinic.
<ABS> All participants had varying degrees of gingivitis but no evidence of loss of the bone that the teeth are anchored in (alveolar bone) which is caused by periodontitis.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The most pertinent result found was from one study which was based in general practice, the most appropriate setting.
<ABS> This study did not show either a benefit or harm for regular six or 12-month scale and polish treatments when compared to no scale and polish.
<ABS> However, the study on young air force cadets compared scale and polish treatments at different time intervals and did find some differences for gingivitis, plaque and calculus when three-month treatments were compared with annual treatments, favouring the three-month treatments.
<ABS> This study also looked at whether the treatment should include both scale and polish and oral hygiene instruction.
<ABS> There were reductions in gingivitis, plaque and calculus.
<ABS> No studies compared dentists with other oral health professionals.
<ABS> Scaling is an invasive procedure and associated with a number of adverse effects including damaged to tooth surfaces and tooth sensitivity.
<ABS> This information was not captured or reported on by the included studies.
<ABS> None of the studies included in this review reported on patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life or economic outcomes.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Given the considerable resources involved in providing this treatments for adults in many countries it is disappointing that there is so little good quality, reliable research evidence available to inform clinical practice.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was generally low, with one of the included studies being more appropriate than the others.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Many dentists or hygienists provide scaling and polishing for patients at regular intervals, even if those patients are considered to be at low risk of developing periodontal disease.
<INT> There is debate over the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of 'routine scaling and polishing' and the 'optimal' frequency at which it should be provided for healthy adults.
<INT> A 'routine scale and polish' treatment is defined as scaling or polishing or both of the crown and root surfaces of teeth to remove local irritational factors (plaque, calculus, debris and staining), that does not involve periodontal surgery or any form of adjunctive periodontal therapy such as the use of chemotherapeutic agents or root planing.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 15 July 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 15 July 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 15 July 2013).
<MaM> There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We calculated mean differences (MDs) (standardised mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted where possible and where deemed necessary for missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies were included in this review with 836 participants included in the analyses.
<RES> All three studies are assessed as at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> The numerical results are only presented here for the primary outcome gingivitis.
<RES> There were no useable data presented in the studies for the outcomes of attachment change and tooth loss.
<RES> No studies reported any adverse effects.
<RES> - Objective 1: Scale and polish versus no scale and polishOnly one trial provided data for the comparison between scale and polish versus no scale and polish.
<RES> This study was conducted in general practice and compared both six-monthly and 12-monthly scale and polish treatments with no treatment.
<RES> This study showed no evidence to claim or refute benefit for scale and polish treatments for the outcomes of gingivitis, calculus and plaque.
<RES> The MD for six-monthly scale and polish, for the percentage of index teeth with bleeding at 24 months was -2% (95% CI -10% to 6%; P value = 0.65), with 40% of the sites in the control group with bleeding.
<RES> The MD for 12-monthly scale and polish was -1% (95% CI -9% to 7%; P value = 0.82).
<RES> The body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 2: Scale and polish at different time intervalsTwo studies, both at unclear risk of bias, compared routine scale and polish provided at different time intervals.
<RES> When comparing six with 12 months there was insufficient evidence to determine a difference for gingivitis at 24 months SMD -0.08 (95% CI -0.27 to 0.10).
<RES> There were some statistically significant differences in favour of scaling and polishing provided at more frequent intervals, in particular between three and 12 months for the outcome of gingivitis at 24 months, with OHI, MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.05; P value = 0.003) and without OHI MD -0.21 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.12; P value < 0.001) (mean per patient measured on 0-3 scale), based on one study.
<RES> There was some evidence of a reduction in calculus.
<RES> This body of evidence was assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 3: Scale and polish with and without OHIOne study provided data for the comparison of scale and polish treatment with and without OHI.
<RES> There was a reduction in gingivitis for the 12-month scale and polish treatment when assessed at 24 months MD -0.14 (95% CI -0.22 to -0.06) in favour of including OHI.
<RES> There were also significant reductions in plaque for both three and 12-month scale and polish treatments when OHI was included.
<RES> The body of evidence was once again assessed as of low quality.
<RES> - Objective 4: Scale and polish provided by a dentist compared with a dental care professionalNo studies were found which compared the effects of routine scaling and polishing provided by a dentist or dental care professional (dental therapist or dental hygienist) on periodontal health.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of routine scale and polish treatments.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Children under 3 years of age who have HIV infection have a high risk of dying without antiretroviral therapy (ART).
<ABS> However, treatment in this age group is challenging because there are high levels of virus in the blood and few suitable drug choices.
<ABS> Results from this systematic review show that ART soon after birth is preferable to delaying treatment, because infants are less likely to die or become sick.
<ABS> Starting a first-line treatment regimen that includes lopinavir/ritonavir rather than nevirapine is preferable, because infants and young children are less likely to have to stop treatment, whether or not they had previously been exposed to nevirapine.
<ABS> However, lopinavir/ritonavir is more expensive than nevirapine.
<ABS> It is also currently only available as an inconvenient liquid, which tastes bitter and has to be refrigerated, making it challenging to implement in all parts of the world.
<ABS> While waiting for better formulations to become available, it may be possible to switch from lopinavir/ritonavir to nevirapine once the HIV virus levels become undetectable.
<ABS> However, based on the evidence currently available, a viral load test would be required to identify those children who could safely substitute lopinavir/ritonavir with nevirapine.
<ABS> Viral loads are expensive and not widely available in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
<ABS> An alternative treatment approach is to give a stronger drug combination (four different drugs together) when treatment is first started, then reduce down to three drugs after a short while.
<ABS> However, this strategy did not appear to have long-term benefits.
<ABS> A 'treatment interruption' strategy, in which infants start ART soon after birth but then stop medication after 1-2 years, is difficult to implement.
<ABS> Children stopping ART need to restart it very quickly to prevent them becoming sick, and monitoring a child off treatment is challenging in settings with few resources.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), over 50% of HIV-infected infants progress to AIDS and death by 2 years of age.
<INT> Key management decisions include when to start ART, what regimen to start, and whether and when to substitute drugs or interrupt therapy.
<INT> This review, an update of a previous review, aims to summarize the currently available evidence on this topic and inform the ART management in HIV-infected children less than 3 years of age.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Search methods
<MaM> We searched for published studies in the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Library, Pubmed, EMBASE and CENTRAL.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two reviewers independently applied study selection criteria, assessed study quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A search of the databases identified a total of 735 unique, previously unreviewed studies, of which 731 were excluded to leave 4 new studies to incorporate into the review.
<RES> Four additional studies were identified in conference proceedings, for a total of 8 studies addressing when to start treatment (n=2), what to start (n=3), whether to substitute lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) with nevirapine (NVP) (n=1), whether to use an induction-maintenance ART strategy (n=1) and whether to interrupt treatment (n=1).
<RES> Treatment initiation in asymptomatic infants with good immunological status was associated with a 75% reduction (HR=0.25; 95%CI 0.12-0.51; p=0.0002) in mortality or disease progression in the one trial with sufficient power to address this question.
<RES> In a smaller pilot trial, median CD4 cell count was not significantly different between early and deferred treatment groups 12 months after ART.
<RES> Regardless of previous exposure to nevirapine for PMTCT, the hazard for treatment failure at 24 weeks was 1.79 (95%CI 1.33, 2.41) times higher in children starting ART with a NVP-based regimen compared to those starting with a LPV/r-based regimen (p=0.0001) with no clear difference in the effect observed for children younger or older than 1 year.
<RES> The hazard for virological failure at 24 weeks was overall 1.84 (95%CI 1.29, 2.63) times higher for children starting ART with a NVP-based regimen compared to those starting with a LPV/r-based regimen (p=0.0008) with a larger difference in time to virological failure (or death) between the NVP and LPV/r-based regimens when ART was initiated in the first year of life.
<RES> Infants starting a LPV/r regimen and achieving sustained virological suppression who then substituted LPV/r with NVP after median 9 months on LPV/r were less likely to develop virological failure (defined as at least one VL greater than 50 copies/mL) compared with infants who started and stayed on LPV/r (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.41, 0.92, p=0.02).
<RES> However the hazard for confirmed failure at a higher viral load (>1000 copies/mL) was greater among children who switched to NVP compared to those who remained on LPV/r (HR=10.19, 95% CI 2.36, 43.94, p=0.002).
<RES> Children undergoing an induction-maintenance ART approach with a 4-drug NNRTI-based regimen for 36 weeks, followed by 3-drug ART, had significantly greater CD4 rise than children receiving a standard 3-drug NNRTI-based ART at 36 weeks (mean difference 1.70 [95%CI 0.61, 2.79] p=0.002) and significantly better viral load response at 24 weeks (OR 1.99 [95%CI 1.09, 3.62] p=0.02).
<RES> However, the immunological and virological benefits were short-term.
<RES> The one trial of treatment interruption that compared children initiating continuous ART from infancy with children interrupting ART was terminated early because the duration of treatment interruption was less than 3 months in most infants.
<RES> Children interrupting treatment had similar growth and occurrence of serious adverse events as those in the continuous arm.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> ART initiation in asymptomatic children under 1 year of age reduces morbidity and mortality, but it remains unclear whether there are clinical benefits to starting ART in asymptomatic children diagnosed with HIV infection between 1-3 years.
<CON> The available evidence shows that a LPV/r-based first-line regimen is more efficacious than a NVP-based regimen, regardless of PMTCT exposure status.
<CON> New formulations of LPV/r are urgently required to enable new WHO recommendations to be implemented.
<CON> An alternative approach to long-term LPV/r is substituting LPV/r with NVP once virological suppression is achieved.
<CON> This strategy looked promising in the one trial undertaken, but may be difficult to implement in the absence of routine viral load testing.
<CON> A 4-drug induction-maintenance approach showed short-term virological and immunological benefits during the induction phase but, in the absence of sustained benefits, is not recommended as a routine treatment strategy.
<CON> Treatment interruption following early ART initiation in infancy was challenging for children who were severely immunocompromised in the context of poor clinical immunological condition at ART initiation due to the short duration of interruption, and is therefore not practical in ART treatment programmes where close monitoring is not feasible.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of differing volumes of initial fluid administration (up to 72 hours) on death and various neurological sequelae in people with acute bacterial meningitis.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the fluid in the spinal cord and surrounding the brain.
<ABS> Antibiotics are prescribed as treatment.
<ABS> Supportive care includes other drugs and the regulation of fluid intake.
<ABS> Despite treatment, there is a risk of death or long-term complications from the infection, especially in the youngest and oldest patients.
<ABS> There has been disagreement as to whether fluids should be restricted (hormones secreted by very ill patients reduce normal fluid output by the body).
<ABS> There are potential risks from giving too much fluid (especially brain swelling) as well as too little fluid (especially shock).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to November 2013.
<ABS> We did not find any trials in adult populations.
<ABS> We included three trials involving 415 children (over 350 of whom were in a single trial).
<ABS> All trials were set in countries where death rates are high and where patients seek help late.
<ABS> In one study no funding source was mentioned.
<ABS> The remaining two studies were funded jointly by pharmaceutical concerns with government agencies and a charitable agency.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Analysis of available trials found no significant differences in death rates or overall effects on neurological function, either immediately or later.
<ABS> However, for acute neurological sequelae, one study found a significantly lower rate of seizures and spasticity (abnormal body tone) in children receiving normal amounts of fluid compared to those receiving restricted fluids.
<ABS> There was also some evidence favouring maintenance fluid therapy over restricted fluids for chronic severe neurological events at three months follow-up.
<ABS> An adverse effect in children with restricted fluid intake was that they were less likely to have low levels of sodium in their blood and therefore they would experience greater reductions in body fluids.
<ABS> An adverse effect of unrestricted fluid administration was reported in one study as short-term swelling of the face and low blood sodium levels one to two days after fluids were started, although the largest study found no difference in blood sodium levels.
<ABS> No studies reported important healthcare outcomes like duration of hospital stay, raised intracranial pressure and status epilepticus.
<ABS> The review found limited evidence from these trials in support of not restricting fluids in settings with high mortality rates.
<ABS> As there were no trials in other settings, there is no evidence to guide clinicians when children with meningitis present early in settings with low mortality rates.
<ABS> There is no evidence to guide clinicians about fluid therapy in adult patients with acute bacterial meningitis.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of evidence was moderate for the outcomes of death, chronic severe neurological sequelae and mild to moderate neurological sequelae.
<ABS> The quality of evidence was very low for acute severe neurological sequelae.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute bacterial meningitis remains a disease with high mortality and morbidity rates.
<INT> Careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance is an important supportive therapy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> For this update we identified two abstracts, but after obtaining full texts we excluded them.
<MaM> Previous searches had identified six trials; on careful inspection three trials (415 children) met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> All four of the original review authors extracted data and assessed trials for quality (one author, ROW, has died since the original review; see Acknowledgements).
<MaM> We combined data for meta-analysis using risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data or mean difference (MD) for continuous data.
<MaM> We used a fixed-effect statistical model.
<MaM> We assessed overall evidence quality using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There were no trials in adult populations.
<RES> All included trials were on paediatric patient groups.
<RES> The largest of the three trials was conducted in settings with high mortality rates.
<RES> The meta-analysis found no significant difference between the maintenance-fluid and restricted-fluid groups in number of deaths (RR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.27; 407 participants) (moderate trial quality); acute severe neurological sequelae (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 407 participants) (very low trial quality); or in mild to moderate sequelae (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.65; 357 participants) (moderate trial quality).
<RES> However, when neurological sequelae were defined further, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the maintenance-fluid group for spasticity (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.93; 357 participants); seizures at both 72 hours (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; 357 participants) and 14 days (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88; 357 participants); and chronic severe neurological sequelae at three months follow-up (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.89; 351 participants).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The quality of evidence regarding fluid therapy in children with acute bacterial meningitis is not high-grade and there is a need for further research.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration have conducted a review of two types of knee replacement surgery for people with knee osteoarthritis.
<ABS> In one type, the posterior cruciate ligament is kept and in the other, it is removed.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, they found 17 studies with up to 1810 patients.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with osteoarthritis who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved during total knee replacement surgery:
<ABS> - this may not improve their range of motion, pain, function and patient satisfaction compared with removing the ligament.
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects and complications, especially rare but serious side effects.
<ABS> Possible side effects may include infection, pain, and the need to have further surgery.
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what is the posterior cruciate ligament?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip.
<ABS> When the joint loses cartilage, the bone may grow abnormally to try and repair the damage and make things worse.
<ABS> For example, it can make the joint painful and unstable.
<ABS> This can affect your physical function or ability to use your knee.
<ABS> In some people, damage and pain in the knee from arthritis may be severe enough to require surgery.
<ABS> In total knee replacement surgery, a surgeon removes the damaged joint surface and replaces it with a metal and plastic implant.
<ABS> The posterior cruciate ligament provides support and stable movement of the knee.
<ABS> In total knee replacement surgery, the posterior cruciate ligament can be kept in place or removed.
<ABS> This choice depends on the condition of the ligament, the type of total knee replacement selected or preference of the surgeon.
<ABS> When the ligament is removed, a special peg is used to provide stability and give your knee forward and backward movement with the tibia stabilised in relation to the femur.
<ABS> What happens to people who have the posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed during total knee replacement surgery
<ABS> Range of motion (range of motion is the distance your knee can move from being bent to being fully extended.
<ABS> A lower range of motion is worse; you can’t bend or stretch your knee fully)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had 2 ° less range of motion compared to those who had it removed.
<ABS> This may be a result of chance - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed had a range of motion of 118 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °- People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved had a range of motion of 116 ° of a possible 0 ° to 140 °
<ABS> Knee pain (lower score means worse pain)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their pain to be the same as those who had it removed.
<ABS> This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their pain to be 48 on a scale of 0 to 50
<ABS> Health related quality of life and functional measures (higher means worse)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 1 point worse than those who had it removed.
<ABS> This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their quality of life to be 16 on a scale of 0 to 100
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament removed rated their quality of life to be 15 on a scale of 0 to 100
<ABS> Patient satisfaction (lower means worse)
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved rated their satisfaction the same as those who had it removed.
<ABS> This may be a result of chance
<ABS> - People who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed rated their satisfaction to be 8 on a scale of 0 to 10
<ABS> Complications and the need to have further surgery
<ABS> - There were no differences in the number of revision surgeries, complications, or other further surgeries in people who had their posterior cruciate ligament preserved or removed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Several new trials have been conducted since then.
<INT> Hence, an update of the review was performed.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> An extensive search was conducted in CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier, Current Contents Connect and Science Direct.
<MaM> All databases were searched, without any limitations, up to 6 December 2012.
<MaM> References of the articles were checked and citation tracking was performed.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were collected with a pre-developed form.
<MaM> Risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors (WV, LB).
<MaM> The level of evidence was graded using the GRADE approach.
<MaM> Meta-analysis was performed by pooling the results of the selected studies, when possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen randomised controlled trials (with 1810 patients and 2206 knees) were found, described in 18 articles.
<RES> Ten of these were new studies compared to the previous Cochrane Review.
<RES> One study from the original Cochrane review was excluded.
<RES> Most new studies compared a posterior cruciate ligament retaining design with a posterior stabilised design, in which the posterior cruciate ligament is sacrificed (a posterior stabilised design has an insert with a central post which can engage on a femoral cam during flexion).
<RES> The quality of evidence (graded with the GRADE approach) and the risk of bias were highly variable, ranging from moderate to low quality evidence and with unclear or low risk of bias for most domains, respectively.
<RES> The performance outcome 'range of motion' was 2.4 ° higher in favour of posterior cruciate ligament sacrifice (118.3 ° versus 115.9 °; 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference 0.13 to 4.67; P = 0.04), however the results were heterogeneous.
<RES> On the item 'knee pain' as experienced by patients, meta-analysis could be performed on the Knee Society knee pain score; this score was 48.3 in both groups, yielding no difference between the groups.
<RES> Implant survival rate could not be meta-analysed adequately since randomised controlled trials lack the longer term follow-up in order to evaluate implant survival.
<RES> A total of four revisions in the cruciate-retention and four revisions in the cruciate-sacrifice group were found.
<RES> The well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) total score was not statistically significantly different between the groups (16.6 points for cruciate-retention versus 15.0 points for cruciate-sacrifice).
<RES> One study reported a patient satisfaction grade (7.7 points for cruciate-retention versus 7.9 points for cruciate-sacrifice on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being completely satisfied) which did not differ statistically significantly.
<RES> Complications were distributed equally between both groups.
<RES> Only one study reported several re-operations other than revision surgery; that is patella luxations, surgical manipulation because of impaired flexion.
<RES> The mean functional Knee Society Score was 2.3 points higher (81.2 versus 79.0 points; 95% CI of the difference 0.37 to 4.26; P = 0.02) in the posterior cruciate ligament sacrificing group.
<RES> Results from the outcome Knee Society functional score were homogeneous.
<RES> All other outcome measures (extension angle, knee pain, adverse effects, clinical questionnaire scores, Knee Society clinical scores, radiological rollback, radiolucencies, femorotibial angle and tibial slope) showed no statistically significant differences between the groups.
<RES> In the subgroup analyses that allowed pooling of the results of the different studies, no homogeneous statistically significant differences were identified.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The methodological quality and the quality of reporting of the studies were highly variable.
<CON> These differences are clinically not relevant.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In newborn infants, the number of red blood cells in the circulation decreases after birth.
<ABS> In infants born before term this decrease is exaggerated by frequent withdrawal of blood, which may be necessary to monitor the infant's clinical condition.
<ABS> Therefore, infants born before term are likely to require transfusions of red blood cells.
<ABS> Low levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production, in preterm infants provide a rationale for the use of EPO to prevent or treat anaemia.
<ABS> EPO can be given 'early' (before the infant reaches eight days of age) in order to prevent or decrease the use of red blood cell transfusions.
<ABS> A total of 2209 infants born before term have been enrolled in 27 studies that used this approach.
<ABS> Early EPO treatment reduced the number of red blood cell transfusions and donor exposures following its use.
<ABS> However, the overall benefit of EPO may not be clinically important as many of these infants had been exposed to red blood cell transfusions prior to entry into the trials.
<ABS> Treatment with early EPO did not have any important effects on mortality or common complications of preterm birth with the exception that EPO may increase the risk for retinopathy of prematurity, a serious complication that can cause blindness in babies born before term.
<ABS> Based on our findings EPO is not recommended for routine use in preterm infants.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The methods of the Neonatal Cochrane Review Group were used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The updated review includes 27 studies enrolling 2209 infants.
<RES> One study enrolling infants at a mean age of > eight days and one duplicate publication were excluded.
<RES> One new study using darepoetin was identified.
<RES> Early EPO reduced the risk of the 'use of one or more RBC transfusions' (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.85; typical risk difference (RD) -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; I2 = 54% for both; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 6 to 10; 16 studies, 1661 infants).
<RES> The total volume of RBCs transfused per infant was reduced (typical mean difference (MD) 7 mL/kg, 95% CI -12 to - 2; I2 = 63%; 7 studies, 581 infants).
<RES> The number of RBC transfusions per infant was minimally reduced (typical MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.12; I2 = 64%; 13 studies, 951 infants).
<RES> The number of donors to whom the infants were exposed was significantly reduced (MD-0.54, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.20; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 254 infants).
<RES> There was a non-significant increase in the risk of stage ≥ 3 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with early EPO (typical RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.17; I2 = 0%; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06; I2 = 29%; 7 studies, 801 infants).
<RES> A post hoc analysis including all studies that reported on ROP stage ≥ 3, regardless of the age of the infant when EPO treatment was started, showed a significantly increased typical RR of 1.48 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.13; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%) and typical RD of 0.03 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.06; P = 0.03; I2 = 50%; 10 studies, 1303 infants) with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 33 (95% CI 17 to infinity).
<RES> In an Italian study in which the authors compared the use of early intravenous EPO with subcutaneous EPO the overall incidence of stage ≥ 3 was 15%, similar to the incidence of 17% in the study by Romagnoli and co-workers.
<RES> The rates for mortality and morbidities including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis were not significantly changed by early EPO treatment.
<RES> Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months varied.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Early administration of EPO reduces the use of RBC transfusions, the volume of RBCs transfused, and donor exposure after study entry.
<CON> The small reductions are likely to be of limited clinical importance.
<CON> Donor exposure is probably not avoided since all but one study included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry.
<CON> In this update there was no significant increase in the rate of ROP (stage ≥ 3) for studies that initiated EPO treatment at less than eight days of age.
<CON> In a post hoc analysis including all studies that reported on ROP stage ≥ 3 regardless of age at initiation of treatment there was an increased risk of ROP.
<CON> The rates for mortality and morbidities including intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis were not significantly changed by early EPO treatment.
<CON> Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months vary in the studies published to date.
<CON> Ongoing research should deal with the issue of ROP and evaluate current clinical practice that will limit donor exposure.
<CON> Due to the limited benefits and the possibly increased risk of ROP, administration of EPO is not recommended.
<CON> Darbepoetin requires further study.
<CON> The possible neuroprotective role of EPO in neonates will be reviewed in separate Cochrane reviews.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of erythropoietin treatment between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The percentage of circulating red blood cells (hematocrit) falls after birth in all infants.
<ABS> This is particularly true in preterm infants due to their poor response to anaemia and to the amount of blood that is drawn for necessary testing.
<ABS> Low plasma levels of erythropoietin (a substance in the blood that stimulates red blood cell production) in preterm infants provide a rationale for the use of erythropoietin to prevent/treat anaemia.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> The evidence is current to July, 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> To date 1591 infants (between eight and 28 days of age) born preterm have been enrolled in 30 studies of late administration of EPO to reduce the use of red blood cell transfusions and to prevent donor exposure.
<ABS> Study funding sources
<ABS> We as reviewers have not received any funding for this review and we have no conflict of interest to declare.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> The risk of receiving red blood transfusion is reduced following initiation of EPO treatment.
<ABS> However, the overall benefit of EPO is reduced as many of these infants had been exposed to donor blood prior to entry into the trials.
<ABS> Treatment with late EPO did not have any important effects on death or common complications of preterm birth, except for trends in an increased risk for retinopathy of prematurity.
<ABS> Retinopathy of prematurity is a disease of the eye affecting babies born preterm.
<ABS> It is thought to be caused by disorganized growth of retinal blood vessels, which may result in scarring and retinal detachment.
<ABS> Retinopathy of prematurity can be mild and may resolve spontaneously, but it may lead to blindness in serious cases.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The study quality varied and important information regarding the random sequence generation and whether the allocation was concealed or not was often missing.
<ABS> Sample sizes were small and long-term outcomes (18 to 24 months corrected age) were not reported.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in July 2013.
<MaM> Additional searches included the Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meetings from 2000 to 2013 (Abstracts2View™) and clinical trials registries (www.clinicaltrials.gov; www.controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp/en).
<MaM> For this update we moved one study from the early EPO review to this late EPO review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 30 studies (31 comparisons) randomising 1591 preterm infants.
<RES> Literature searches in 2013 did not identify any new study for inclusion.
<RES> For this update we moved one study enrolling 230 infants from the early EPO review to this late EPO review.
<RES> Most included trials were of small sample size.
<RES> The meta-analysis showed a significant effect of the use of one or more RBC transfusions (20 studies (n = 1142); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8).
<RES> There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 68%; RD I² = 60%).
<RES> We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation.
<RES> There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant [typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants].
<RES> There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%).
<RES> There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06).
<RES> There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%).
<RES> Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18).
<RES> There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%).
<RES> Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3).
<RES> The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10).
<RES> There was minimal heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%).
<RES> There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes.
<RES> There was no reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis in spite of a reduction in the use of RBC transfusions.
<RES> Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (ml/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant.
<CON> Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry.
<CON> Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP.
<CON> Further research of the use of late EPO treatment to prevent donor exposure is not indicated.
<CON> Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment.
<CON> The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Damage to the nervous system can lead to a lack of co-ordination (dyssynergia) between the bladder (detrusor) and the muscle at the exit of the bladder that allows people to control their bladder emptying (external urethral sphincter muscle).
<ABS> This urologic condition is called detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) and is most frequently seen in people with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis.
<ABS> Insufficient relaxation of the sphincter during a voiding contraction prevents effective bladder emptying and can lead to high pressures in the bladder.
<ABS> People with increased bladder pressures are at an increased risk for bladder and kidney infections, which may lead to kidney damage and even failure.
<ABS> Treatment is aimed at lowering these pressures by promoting proper bladder emptying.
<ABS> This can be achieved by inserting a thin tube (catheter) in the urethra (i.e. the tube connected to the bladder through which urine is released from the body) to empty the bladder on a regular basis (intermittent catheterisation), use of drugs, or surgery.
<ABS> The first step in treatment is usually not surgery, but surgical options should be considered if this is not possible or feasible.
<ABS> Different types of surgical treatment exist, but the optimal surgical treatment for this condition in adults is as yet unknown.
<ABS> This question is the subject of this review.
<ABS> We found five trials, which included a total of 199 people (with an average age of 40 years) with a variety of causes of DSD.
<ABS> One trial showed that a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the sphincter (sphincterotomy) is better in lowering bladder pressure than placing a permanent thin tube into the urethra (urethral stent), but only after two years.
<ABS> Botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) is a toxin that targets the nervous system locally and interferes with the communications between nerves and muscles.
<ABS> Four trials used botulinum A toxin injections to weaken or paralyse the sphincter.
<ABS> These four trials independently showed that in some outcomes, BTX-A was more effective than placebo, lidocaine, or a treatment combined with drugs.
<ABS> Compared to placebo, BTX-A was more effective in lowering pre-voiding and maximum bladder pressure after 30 days.
<ABS> Comparing BTX-A to lidocaine injections, bladder emptying improved seven and 30 days after botulinum A toxin injection, however, not after one day.
<ABS> Botulinum A toxin injection without the addition of drugs (baclofen) was possibly more effective in increasing the ability of the bladder to stretch than botulinum A toxin injection combined with drugs.
<ABS> However, the quality of the trial reporting this was poor.
<ABS> The botulinum A toxin injection is effective for two to three months and therefore requires frequent reinjection, while the effects of sphincter incision seem to last for at least two years.
<ABS> Two trials reported blood in the urine after injection as an undesired harmful effects (adverse effects) due to the injection of an agent.
<ABS> Also, muscle weakness was reported, which may relate to the BTX-A dose injected.
<ABS> Overall, results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that BTX-A injection improves some outcomes relating to the dynamics of the bladder and urethra in storing and releasing urine 30 days after injection.
<ABS> However, this review showed that there was not enough evidence to identify the most effective surgical treatment for DSD.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The most common type of functional bladder outlet obstruction in patients with neurogenic bladder is detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five trials (total of 199 participants, average age of 40 years).
<RES> The neurological diseases causing DSD were traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), multiple sclerosis (MS), or congenital malformations.
<RES> One trial compared placement of sphincteric stent prosthesis with sphincterotomy.
<RES> Four trials considered botulinum A toxin (BTX-A) injection in the EUS, either alone or in combination with other treatments.
<RES> The comparators included oral baclofen, oral alpha blocker, lidocaine, and placebo.
<RES> The BTX-A trials all differed in protocols, and therefore we did not undertake meta-analysis.
<RES> Results for maximum uroflow rate, maximal cystometric capacity, and volume per voiding were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either BTX-A injection or BTX-A injection with the addition of oral baclofen.
<RES> However, the poor quality of reporting in this trial caused us to question the relevance of bladder compliance as an adequate outcome measure.
<RES> However, after seven and 30 days of BTX-A injection, PVRs were lower (MD -163 and -158 mL, 95% CI -308.65 to -17.35 and 95% CI -277.57 to -39.03, respectively) compared to participants who received lidocaine injections.
<RES> Finally, one small trial consisting of five men with SCI compared weekly BTX-A injections with normal saline as placebo.
<RES> The placebo had no effect on DSD in the two participants allocated to the placebo treatment.
<RES> Their urodynamic parameters were unchanged from baseline values until subsequent injections with BTX-A once a week for three weeks.
<RES> These subsequent injections resulted in similar responses to those of the three participants who were allocated to the BTX-A treatment.
<RES> Unfortunately, the report presented no data on placebo treatment.
<RES> Only the trial that compared sphincterotomy with stent placement reported outcome measures renal function and urologic complications related to DSD.
<RES> Results for renal function at 12 and 24 months, and urologic complications related to DSD at three, six, 12, and 24 months were inconclusive and consistent with benefit of either sphincteric stent prosthesis or sphincterotomy.
<RES> Adverse effects reported were haematuria due to the cystoscopic injection and muscle weakness, of which the latter may be related to the BTX-A dose used.
<RES> All trials had some methodological shortcomings, so insufficient information was available to permit judgement of risk of bias.
<RES> At least half of the trials had an unclear risk of selection bias and reporting bias.
<RES> One trial had a high risk of attrition bias, and another trial had a high risk of reporting bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Results from small studies with a high risk of bias have identified evidence of limited quality that intraurethral BTX-A injections improve some urodynamic measures after 30 days in the treatment of functional bladder outlet obstruction in adults with neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
<CON> The necessity of reinjection of BTX-A is a significant drawback; a sphincterotomy might therefore be a more effective treatment option for lowering bladder pressure in the long-term.
<CON> However, because of the limited availability of eligible trials, this review was unable to provide robust evidence in favour of any of the surgical treatment options.
<CON> More RCTs are needed, measuring improvement on quality of life, and on other types of surgical treatment options for DSD since these are lacking.
<CON> Future RCTs assessing the effectiveness of BTX-A injections also need to address the uncertainty about the optimal dose and mode of injection for this specific type of urological condition.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stomach contents can regurgitate up the gullet into the wind pipe and enter the lungs when there is no cough reflex, e.g. during general anaesthesia.
<ABS> The acidic liquid from the stomach can damage the lungs.
<ABS> This is called aspiration pneumonitis or Mendelson’s syndrome.
<ABS> It can lead to serious illness or even death.
<ABS> Many caesarean sections now are undertaken using epidural or spinal anaesthesia, and here the risk is much lower because the woman stays awake and the cough reflex remains intact.
<ABS> A breathing tube, which provides a seal, is normally placed in the windpipe when setting up a general anaesthetic to try to prevent this problem.
<ABS> Thirty-two studies were included in this review.
<ABS> However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis, looking at interventions given prior to caesarean section for reducing the risk of aspiration.
<ABS> There were several different drugs and drug combinations being considered and the studies were generally of poor or questionable quality.
<ABS> Antacids (like sodium citrate), H2 receptor antagonists (like ranitidine), proton pump antagonists (like omeprazole), all reduced the acidity of the stomach contents.
<ABS> An antacid plus an H2 receptor antagonist also reduced acidity.
<ABS> In theory, a combination like this, where the antacid acts quickly and the H2 receptor antagonists takes a little longer, should protect at periods of greatest risk, i.e. the beginning and end of the procedure (i.e. intubation and extubation).
<ABS> More research is needed to identify the best combination of drugs and to check for possible adverse effects.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Aspiration pneumonitis is a syndrome resulting from the inhalation of gastric contents.
<INT> However, aspiration pneumonitis is still a cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and it is important to use effective prophylaxis.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials were included.
<MaM> Quasi-randomised trials were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction.
<MaM> Data entry was checked.
<MaM> Fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to combine data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect.
<MaM> If substantial clinical or statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-effects analysis to produce an overall summary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-two studies were included in this review.
<RES> However, only 22 studies, involving 2658 women, provided data for analysis.
<RES> All the women in the included studies had a caesarean section under general anaesthesia.
<RES> The studies covered a number of comparisons, but were mostly small and of unclear or poor quality.
<RES> When compared with no treatment or placebo, there was a significant reduction in the risk of intragastric pH < 2.5 with antacids (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.32, two studies, 108 women), H2 antagonists (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.18, two studies, 170 women) and proton pump antagonists (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46, one study 80 women).
<RES> H2 antagonists were associated with a reduced the risk of intragastric pH < 2.5 at intubation when compared with proton pump antagonists (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.97, one study, 120 women), but compared with antacids the findings were unclear.
<RES> The combined use of 'antacids plus H2 antagonists' was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of intragastric pH < 2.5 at intubation when compared with placebo (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15, one study, 89 women) or compared with antacids alone (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, one study, 119 women).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> These findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Non-surgical management after non-surgical repositioning of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is an injury in which the top end of the upper arm bone is pushed out of the joint socket in a forward direction.
<ABS> Afterwards, the shoulder is less stable and is prone to re-dislocation or subluxation (partial re-dislocation), especially in active young adults.
<ABS> Initial treatment involves putting the joint back in place.
<ABS> This is called 'closed reduction' when it is done without surgery.
<ABS> Subsequent treatment is often conservative (non-surgical) and generally involves placement of the injured arm in a sling or in another immobilising device followed by specific exercises.
<ABS> After a comprehensive search, completed in September 2013, for randomised controlled trials that compared different methods of conservative management of these injuries we included only four trials, one of which was not truly randomised.
<ABS> These trials involved a total of 470 participants (371 male).
<ABS> All had primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods.
<ABS> Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers.
<ABS> All trials were at some risk of bias (systematic errors that could lead to overestimation or underestimation of treatment effectiveness), with two trials in particular being at high risk of bias in a number of aspects.
<ABS> Overall, the quality of the evidence was very low, meaning that we are very uncertain about the direction and size of effect.
<ABS> All four trials compared immobilisation of the arm in external rotation (when the arm is orientated outwards with the forearm away from the chest) versus immobilisation in internal rotation (the usual sling position, where the arm rests against the chest) following closed reduction.
<ABS> Investigators followed patients for at least two years.
<ABS> The results showed no difference between the two groups in any of our pre-defined outcomes.
<ABS> These included re-dislocations, scores on validated shoulder function questionnaires, return to pre-injury activity or sport, and any instability.
<ABS> Other pre-defined outcomes (patient satisfaction with the intervention, and health-related quality of life outcome data) were not reported.
<ABS> Adverse events were poorly recorded.
<ABS> In our recommendations for future research, we point out the importance of completing and publishing the eight other trials making the same comparison as the four included trials.
<ABS> We also note that other important questions need to be studied, such as how long the shoulder should be immobilised for the best outcomes.
<ABS> In conclusion, current evidence from randomised controlled trials is insufficient to inform choices for conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute anterior dislocation, which is the most common type of shoulder dislocation, usually results from an injury.
<INT> Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to re-dislocation, especially in active young adults.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.
<OBJ> These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information.
<MaM> Results of comparable groups of trials were pooled.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three randomised trials and one quasi-randomised trial, which involved 470 participants (371 male) with primary traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder reduced by various closed methods.
<RES> Three studies evaluated mixed populations; in the fourth study, all participants were male and 80% were soldiers.
<RES> All trials were at some risk of bias but to a differing extent.
<RES> One was at high risk in all domains of the risk of bias tool, and one was at unclear or high risk in all domains; the other two trials were deemed to have predominantly low risk across all domains.
<RES> Overall, reflecting both the risk of bias and the imprecision of findings, we judged the quality of evidence to be "very low" for all outcomes, meaning that we are very uncertain about the estimates of effect.
<RES> The four trials evaluated the same comparison - immobilisation in external rotation versus internal rotation - and each of our three primary outcomes (re-dislocation, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for shoulder instability and resumption of activities) was reported by one or more of the trials, with two-year or longer follow-up.
<RES> Pooling was possible for "re-dislocation" (three trials) and for aspects of "resumption of sport/activities at pre-injury level" (two trials).
<RES> There was no evidence to show a difference between the two groups in re-dislocation at two-year or longer follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.06 favouring internal rotation, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.54; P value 0.77; 252 participants; three trials).
<RES> In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 247 re-dislocations per 1000, these data equate to 15 more (95% CI 67 fewer to 133 more) re-dislocations per 1000 after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> In a medium-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 436 re-dislocations per 1000, the data equate to 26 more (95% CI 118 fewer to 235 more) re-dislocations after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> Nor was evidence found to show a difference between the two groups in return to pre-injury levels of activity at two-year or longer follow-up (RR 1.25 favouring external rotation, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.2; P value 0.43; 278 participants; two trials).
<RES> In a low-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 204 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 41 more (95% CI 59 fewer to 245 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> In a high-risk population, with an illustrative baseline risk of 605 participants per 1000 returning to pre-injury levels of activity, this equates to 161 more (95% CI 76 fewer to 395 more) participants per 1000 resuming activity after immobilisation in external rotation.
<RES> One trial reported that the difference between the two groups in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index scores, analysed using non-parametric statistics, was "not significant (P = 0.32)".
<RES> Of our secondary outcomes, pooling was possible for "any instability" (two trials) and for important adverse events (three events, two trials).
<RES> However, adverse event data were collected only in an ad hoc way, and it is unclear whether identification and reporting of such events was comprehensive.
<RES> No report addressed participant satisfaction or health-related quality of life outcome measures.
<RES> There was no evidence confirming a difference between the two positions of immobilisation in any of the primary or secondary outcomes; for each outcome, the confidence intervals were wide, covering the possibility of substantial benefit for each intervention.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Numerous conservative strategies may be adopted after closed reduction of a traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder, and many warrant investigation.
<CON> However, our review reveals that evidence from randomised controlled trials is only available for a single approach: immobilisation in external rotation versus immobilisation in the traditional position of internal rotation.
<CON> Moreover, this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate whether immobilisation in external rotation confers any benefit over immobilisation in internal rotation.
<CON> We identified six unpublished trials and two ongoing trials that compare immobilisation in external versus internal rotation.
<CON> Given this, the main priority for research on this question consists of the publication of completed trials, and the completion and publication of ongoing trials.
<CON> Meanwhile, increased attention to other interventions is required.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Antibiotic use for irreversible pulpitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are oral antibiotics effective and safe for treating pain in irreversible pulpitis (inflammation of the nerve inside the tooth/nerve damage)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Irreversible pulpitis occurs where the dental pulp (tissue inside the tooth which contains the nerve) has been damaged beyond repair.
<ABS> It is characterised by intense pain (toothache), sufficient to wake someone up at night and is considered to be one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care.
<ABS> Any tooth may be affected, it is not restricted to particular age groups, and it usually occurs as a direct result of dental decay, a cracked tooth or trauma and thus tends to occur more frequently in older patients.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 5 September 2013.
<ABS> One study involving 40 people with irreversible pulpitis (nerve damage) was included.
<ABS> There were two groups of 20 people, one group was treated with penicillin 500 mg, the other with placebo (no active ingredient) every six hours over a seven-day period.
<ABS> In addition, all of the participants received painkillers (ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) combined with codeine).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Antibiotics do not appear to significantly reduce toothache caused by irreversible pulpitis.
<ABS> Furthermore, there was no difference in the total number of ibuprofen or Tylenol tablets used over the study period between both groups.
<ABS> The administration of penicillin does not significantly reduce the pain perception, the percussion (tapping on the tooth) perception or the quantity of pain medication required by people with irreversible pulpitis.
<ABS> There was no reporting on adverse events or reactions.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This was a study with a small number of participants and the quality of the evidence for the different outcomes was rated as low.
<ABS> There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to decide if antibiotics help for this condition.
<ABS> This review highlights the need for more and better quality studies on the use of antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Irreversible pulpitis, which is characterised by acute and intense pain, is one of the most frequent reasons that patients attend for emergency dental care.
<INT> However, a significant number of dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics to stop the pain of irreversible pulpitis.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> There were no language restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened studies and extracted data independently.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADEPro software.
<MaM> Pooling of data was not possible and a descriptive summary is presented.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One trial assessed at low risk of bias, involving 40 participants was included in this update of the review.
<RES> The quality of the body of evidence was rated low for the different outcomes.
<RES> There was a close parallel distribution of the pain ratings in both the intervention and placebo groups over the seven-day study period.
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to claim or refute a benefit for penicillin for pain intensity.
<RES> There was no significant difference in the mean total number of ibuprofen tablets over the study period: 9.2 (standard deviation (SD) 6.02) in the penicillin group versus 9.6 (SD 6.34) in the placebo group; mean difference -0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.23 to 3.43; P value = 0.84).
<RES> This applied equally for the mean total number of Tylenol tablets: 6.9 (SD 6.87) used in the penicillin group versus 4.45 (SD 4.82) in the placebo group; mean difference 2.45 (95% CI -1.23 to 6.13; P value = 0.19).
<RES> Our secondary outcome on reporting of adverse events was not addressed in this study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review which was based on one low powered small sample trial assessed as a low risk of bias, illustrates that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether antibiotics reduce pain or not compared to not having antibiotics.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysms

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with heart disease and diseased leg arteries often undergo investigations and treatments that involve placing a needle into the main artery in the groin (endovascular procedures, for example diagnostic arteriogram, angioplasty, cardiac catheterization).
<ABS> One possible complication is the formation of a large swelling in the artery (a pseudoaneurysm) in the groin.
<ABS> This happens when the hole that the needle makes in the wall of the artery does not seal properly afterwards and blood collects, causing pain, swelling and bruising.
<ABS> Small pseudoaneurysms may clot spontaneously or surgery may be required.
<ABS> Less invasive treatment is now possible to stop the blood flow into the swelling.
<ABS> This involves sedation or analgesia to allow pressure to be placed over the puncture in the artery using a special mechanical device or a probe guided by ultrasound.
<ABS> Another option is injection of a clotting agent (thrombin) through the skin into the swelling.
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature and found four randomised controlled trials.
<ABS> No new studies were included in this update.
<ABS> Application of pressure (compression) with a mechanical device for some 30 minutes caused clotting of the blood in the pseudoaneurysm in three-quarters of people (38 people aged between 40 and 85 years) within 24 hours.
<ABS> It made no difference if the probe was placed blindly or using ultrasound.
<ABS> A further study of 168 people found that compression caused clotting of the pseudoaneurysm in more than 90% of people at 24 hours; again, using ultrasound did not seem to make any difference.
<ABS> Injection of bovine thrombin appeared to be more effective that ultrasound-guided compression (in two studies, including 68 patients in total).
<ABS> There are, however, concerns about allergy to the thrombin and introduction of infectious agents, thought to be responsible for transmission of some degenerative diseases, as well as the possibility of causing a blood clot in the artery.
<ABS> No complications were reported in these studies apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the people treated with compression.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures.
<INT> Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, but sometimes definitive treatment is needed.
<INT> Surgery has traditionally been considered the 'gold standard' treatment, although it is not without risk in patients with severe cardiovascular disease.
<INT> Less invasive treatment options such as Duplex ultrasound-guided compression and percutaneous thrombin injection are available, however, evidence of their efficacy is limited.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Four studies were included in the analyses comparing: manual compression versus ultrasound-guided compression; ultrasound-guided application of a mechanical device (FemoStop) versus blind application; and ultrasound-guided compression versus percutaneous thrombin injection (two studies).
<MaM> There were no studies with a surgical intervention arm.
<MaM> Data were extracted independently by both authors.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Compression (manual or FemoStop) was effective in achieving pseudoaneurysm thrombosis although ultrasound-guided application failed to confer any benefit (risk ratio (RR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.04).
<RES> Percutaneous thrombin injection was more effective than a single session of ultrasound-guided compression in achieving primary pseudoaneurysm thrombosis within individual RCTs but merged data failed to show statistical significance (RR 2.81; 95% CI 0.44 to 18.13).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups and no complications were reported apart from one deep vein thrombosis in the compression group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The limited evidence base appears to support the use of thrombin injection as an effective treatment for femoral pseudoaneurysm.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that is seen as periods of high mood called mania, or hypomania if less severe, and periods of low mood (depression).
<ABS> Medication is the main treatment for mania, with the first aim to decrease agitation, aggression and dangerous behaviour.
<ABS> Antipsychotics and other antimanic medicines are included in guidelines for treating mania.
<ABS> This review considers the antipsychotic, aripiprazole, and assesses how effective it is in the treatment of acute mania.
<ABS> It also examines the side effects of aripiprazole and discusses whether people find aripiprazole to be an acceptable treatment for themselves.
<ABS> Ten studies are included (3340 participants).
<ABS> Most studies compared aripiprazole versus placebo, but some researchers compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (two studies) and versus lithium (one study).
<ABS> Two studies examined the effect of adding aripiprazole to another treatment (valproate or lithium) and compared this combination versus placebo combined with these other treatments.
<ABS> We assessed the overall risk of bias in the ten studies as unclear.
<ABS> The main measure of effect was the mean change on the Young Mania Rating Scale from the start to the end of the trial; this tool is used by clinicians to assess the severity of mania.
<ABS> After three weeks of treatment, aripiprazole was better than placebo at reducing the severity of mania when used on its own or when added to other mood stabilisers.
<ABS> The effect was modest.
<ABS> However, aripiprazole caused more inner restlessness (akathisia), nausea, and constipation than placebo.
<ABS> Aripiprazole was similarly effective in reducing the symptoms of mania when compared with other drug treatments (haloperidol and lithium).
<ABS> Aripiprazole caused fewer movement disorders and less raised prolactin (a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland) than haloperidol.
<ABS> People taking aripiprazole were more likely to remain on treatment than those taking haloperidol but were no more or less likely than those taking placebo or lithium.
<ABS> The main reason for the difference in dropouts between aripiprazole and haloperidol groups was the adverse effects associated with haloperidol.
<ABS> In summary, aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania when compared with placebo.
<ABS> This finding is based on studies that included mixed populations (i.e. children, adolescents and adults).
<ABS> For the adult population, studies have directly compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol, lithium and placebo, but evidence obtained for treatment of the child and adolescent population is available only from placebo-controlled studies.
<ABS> Given the lack of evidence obtained by comparing aripiprazole versus other drugs, its exact place in therapy is unclear.
<ABS> Further studies focused on particular populations are needed to determine whether this treatment is equally effective in different age groups.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Drug treatment is the first-line treatment for acute mania with the initial aim of rapid control of agitation, aggression and dangerous behaviour.
<INT> Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, is used in the treatment of mania both as monotherapy and combined with other medicines.
<INT> The British Association of Psychopharmacology guidelines report that, in monotherapy placebo-controlled trials, the atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, have been shown to be effective for acute manic or mixed episodes.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) was searched, all years to 31st July 2013.
<MaM> This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date).
<MaM> We also searched Bristol-Myers Squibb clinical trials register, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (to August 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The drug manufacturer or the trial authors were contacted for missing data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies (3340 participants) were included in the review.
<RES> Seven studies compared aripiprazole monotherapy versus placebo (2239 participants); two of these included a third comparison arm—one study used lithium (485 participants) and the other used haloperidol (480 participants).
<RES> Two studies compared aripiprazole as an adjunctive treatment to valproate or lithium versus placebo as an adjunctive treatment (754 participants), and one study compared aripiprazole versus haloperidol (347 participants).
<RES> The overall risk of bias was unclear.
<RES> A high dropout rate from most trials (> 20% for each intervention in eight of the trials) may have affected the estimates of relative efficacy.
<RES> Evidence shows that aripiprazole was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms in adults and children/adolescents at three and four weeks but not at six weeks (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS); mean difference (MD) at three weeks (random effects) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.82 to -2.05; six studies; N = 1819, moderate quality evidence) - a modest difference.
<RES> Aripiprazole was compared with other drug treatments in three studies in adults—lithium was used in one study and haloperidol in two studies.
<RES> No statistically significant differences between aripiprazole and other drug treatments in reducing manic symptoms were noted at three weeks (YMRS MD at three weeks (random effects) 0.07, 95% CI -1.24 to 1.37; three studies; N = 972, moderate quality evidence) or at any other time point up to and including 12 weeks.
<RES> Compared with placebo, aripiprazole caused more movement disorders, as measured on the Simpson Angus Scale (SAS), on the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS) and by participant-reported akathisia (high quality evidence), with more people requiring treatment with anticholinergic medication (risk ratios (random effects) 3.28, 95% CI 1.82 to 5.91; two studies; N = 730, high quality evidence).
<RES> Aripiprazole also led to more gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea (high quality evidence), and constipation) and caused more children/adolescents to have a prolactin level that fell below the lower limit of normal.
<RES> Significant heterogeneity was present in the meta-analysis of movement disorders associated with aripiprazole and other treatments and was most likely due to the different side effect profiles of lithium and haloperidol.
<RES> At the three-week time point, meta-analysis was not possible because of lack of data; however, at 12 weeks, haloperidol resulted in significantly more movement disorders than aripiprazole, as measured on the SAS, the BAS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and by participant-reported akathisia.
<RES> By 12 weeks, investigators reported no difference between aripiprazole and lithium (SAS, BAS, AIMS), except in terms of participant-reported akathisia (RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.37 to 6.43; one study; N = 313).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Aripiprazole is an effective treatment for mania in a population that includes adults, children and adolescents, although its use leads to gastrointestinal disturbances and movement disorders.
<CON> Comparative trials with medicines other than haloperidol and lithium are few, so the precise place of aripiprazole in therapy remains unclear.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Kidney transplant patients experience heart disease more often than the general population.
<ABS> Statins have been shown to decrease cholesterol, heart attacks, strokes and deaths for the general population.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to find out whether statins prevent death and complications from heart disease in people who have had a kidney transplant.
<ABS> We included 17 studies in 3282 adults with a functioning kidney transplant which compared statin therapy to a placebo or standard treatment.
<ABS> Based largely on information from a single, large and well-conducted study, statins may reduce complications from heart disease although information from the available research is imprecise.
<ABS> The effects of statin treatment on death overall, stroke, kidney function and side-effects are uncertain in people with a kidney transplant.
<ABS> Large additional studies of statin therapy may improve our confidence that statin treatment can safely prevent serious complications from heart disease for people who have a kidney transplant.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have higher risks of cardiovascular disease compared to the general population.
<INT> Specifically, cardiovascular deaths account most deaths in kidney transplant recipients.
<INT> Statins are a potentially beneficial intervention for kidney transplant patients given their established benefits in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 22 studies (3465 participants); 17 studies (3282 participants) compared statin with placebo or no treatment, and five studies (183 participants) compared two different statin regimens.
<RES> From data generally derived from a single high-quality study, it was found that statins may reduce major cardiovascular events (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.84, CI 0.66 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (4 studies, 2322 participants: RR 0.68, CI 0.45 to 1.01), and fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 0.70, CI 0.48 to 1.01); although effect estimates lack precision and include the possibility of no effect.
<RES> Statins had uncertain effects on all-cause mortality (6 studies, 2760 participants: RR 1.08, CI 0.63 to 1.83); fatal or non-fatal stroke (1 study, 2102 participants: RR 1.18, CI 0.85 to 1.63); creatine kinase elevation (3 studies, 2233 participants: RR 0.86, CI 0.39 to 1.89); liver enzyme elevation (4 studies, 608 participants: RR 0.62, CI 0.33 to 1.19); withdrawal due to adverse events (9 studies, 2810 participants: RR 0.89, CI 0.74 to 1.06); and cancer (1 study, 2094 participants: RR 0.94, CI 0.82 to 1.07).
<RES> Statins significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (12 studies, 3070 participants: MD -42.43 mg/dL, CI -51.22 to -33.65); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3004 participants: MD -43.19 mg/dL, CI -52.59 to -33.78); serum triglycerides (11 studies, 3012 participants: MD -27.28 mg/dL, CI -34.29 to -20.27); and lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (11 studies, 3005 participants: MD -5.69 mg/dL, CI -10.35 to -1.03).
<RES> Statins had uncertain effects on kidney function: ESKD (6 studies, 2740 participants: RR 1.14, CI 0.94 to 1.37); proteinuria (2 studies, 136 participants: MD -0.04 g/24 h, CI -0.17 to 0.25); acute allograft rejection (4 studies, 582 participants: RR 0.88, CI 0.61 to 1.28); and GFR (1 study, 62 participants: MD -1.00 mL/min, CI -9.96 to 7.96).
<RES> Due to heterogeneity in comparisons, data directly comparing differing statin regimens could not be meta-analysed.
<RES> Evidence for statins in people who have had a kidney transplant were sparse and lower quality due to imprecise effect estimates and provided limited systematic evaluation of treatment harm.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Statins may reduce cardiovascular events in kidney transplant recipients, although treatment effects are imprecise.
<CON> Statin treatment has uncertain effects on overall mortality, stroke, kidney function, and toxicity outcomes in kidney transplant recipients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Heart failure is a major public health issue worldwide.
<ABS> Despite advances in treatment, many people are affected and hundreds of thousand of people die each year.
<ABS> Shengmai is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine and is a mixture extracted from three herbs: Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus and Schisandra chinensis.
<ABS> In China it has been used to treat heart failure and ischemiac heart disease.
<ABS> In this Cochrane Review update, we included 14 trials which compared Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone, or compared Shengmai with placebo.
<ABS> Shengmai may be beneficial in improving heart function (low quality evidence) and in most trials, people who took Shengmai had few unwanted side effects.
<ABS> However, many of the included trials were of poor quality and included a small number of people.
<ABS> More high quality, large trials of Shengmai of treatment heart failure are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Heart failure is a major public health problem worldwide.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2012.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also handsearched Chinese journals and did not apply any language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> In this update we only included studies with a clear description of randomisation methods and classified as true RCTs.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> We used a fixed-effect model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes without heterogeneity; and a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis for outcomes with heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included a total of 14 RCTs (858 patients) in this review update, four of which were new trials.
<RES> Of these 14 RCTs, 11 trials compared Shengmai plus usual treatment with usual treatment alone, and three trials compared Shengmai with placebo.
<RES> Improvement of NYHA functional classification was more common in patients taking Shengmai plus usual treatment than in those receiving usual treatment alone (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.51; 10 trials, 672 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> Beneficial effects of Shengmai in treating heart failure were also observed in other outcomes, including exercise test, ejection fraction and cardiac output.
<RES> The three RCTs (106 patients) comparing Shengmai with placebo reported improvement in NYHA functional classification and in stroke volume.
<RES> Three of the 14 RCTs reported a total of six patients with mild adverse effects and two were withdrawn due to the adverse effects.
<RES> The adverse events rate was 1.21%.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Shengmai may exert a positive effect on heart failure, especially for improving NYHA functional classification when Shengmai plus usual treatment is used.
<CON> The review results should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias of the included studies (particularly regarding allocation concealment and blinding), the small sample size of these studies, and the significant heterogeneity in outcomes such as ejection function, cardiac output and stroke volume.
<CON> There was no evidence available concerning the effect of Shengmai on mortality, and more high quality studies with long-term follow-up are warranted.

<H1> Acupuncture for epilepsy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Acupuncture for epilepsy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with epilepsy are currently treated with antiepileptic drugs but a significant number of people continue to have seizures and many experience adverse effects to the drugs.
<ABS> As a result, there is increasing interest in alternative therapies and acupuncture is one of those.
<ABS> Seventeen randomised controlled trials with 1538 participants were included in the current systematic review (literature search conducted on 3rd June 2013).
<ABS> Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control (at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency).
<ABS> If we assumed that 500 out of 1000 patients treated with Chinese herbs alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that 485 to 655 out of 1000 patients treated with needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs would achieve satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture plus valproate was not effective in achieving freedom from seizures or satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 97 to 177 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 289 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture plus valproate would achieve satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> If we assumed that 700 out of 1000 patients treated with phenytoin alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 322 to 1000 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Compared with valproate, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving seizure freedom but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> If we assumed that 136 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved seizure freedom, we estimated that about 126 to 445 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve seizure freedom; if we assumed that 556 out of 1000 patients treated with valproate alone normally achieved satisfactory seizure control, we estimated that about 583 to 923 out of 1000 patients treated with acupuncture alone would achieve satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Compared with antiepileptic drugs, catgut implantation at acupoints plus antiepileptic drugs was not effective in achieving seizure freedom, but it may have been better in achieving satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Compared with valproate, catgut implantation may have been better in achieving seizure freedom but not satisfactory seizure control.
<ABS> Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials.
<ABS> However, the included trials were small, heterogeneous and had a high risk of bias.
<ABS> It remains uncertain whether acupuncture is effective and safe for treating people with epilepsy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acupuncture is increasingly used in people with epilepsy.
<INT> It remains unclear whether existing evidence is rigorous enough to support its use.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in people with epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (June 2013) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 5), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and other databases (from inception to June 2013).
<MaM> We reviewed reference lists from relevant trials.
<MaM> We did not impose any language restrictions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 17 RCTs with 1538 participants that had a wide age range and were suffering mainly from generalized epilepsy.
<RES> The duration of treatment varied from 7.5 weeks to 1 year.
<RES> All included trials had a high risk of bias with short follow-up.
<RES> Compared with Chinese herbs, needle acupuncture plus Chinese herbs was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (80% in control group versus 90% in intervention group, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31, 2 trials; assumed risk 500 per 1000, corresponding risk 485 to 655 per 1000).
<RES> Compared with phenytoin, needle acupuncture was not effective in achieving at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency (70% in control group versus 94.4% in intervention group, RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.44, 2 trials; assumed risk 700 per 1000, corresponding risk 322 to 1000 per 1000).
<RES> Acupuncture did not have excess adverse events compared to control treatment in the included trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Available RCTs are small, heterogeneous and have high risk of bias.
<CON> The current evidence does not support acupuncture for treating epilepsy.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Diacerein for osteoarthritis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Diacerein for osteoarthritis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what is diacerein?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis.
<ABS> In OA, the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones breaks down, causing pain and swelling.
<ABS> OA can affect any joint, but the knees, hips and hands are the joints most often studied in clinical trials.
<ABS> In all, 10% of the world’s population aged 60 or older have pain or disability from OA.
<ABS> Diacerein is a slow-acting drug taken as a pill that may slow the breakdown of cartilage and relieve pain and swelling.
<ABS> The review searched for studies up to March 2013 about primary osteoarthritis affecting men and women (18 years and older) of any disease severity.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with osteoarthitis:
<ABS> - Pain may improve slightly more in people taking diacerein.
<ABS> - Improvement in physical function is about the same for people taking diacerein,- or a placebo (fake pill).
<ABS> This may have happened by chance.
<ABS> - Diacerein may slow the process of joint space narrowing slightly of the hip but may have little or no difference on the knee joint as it is seen on an x-ray.
<ABS> - Diacerein may cause side effects in the lower digestive tract, such as diarrhoea.
<ABS> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in these findings and is likely to change the estimates.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who take diacerein
<ABS> Pain after three to 36 months
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their pain to be 9 points lower on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 100 (extreme pain) after taking the medication for three to 36 months (9% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their pain to be 34 on a scale of 0 to 100 after taking the medication compared to people who took a fake pill and rated their pain to be 43 points on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> Physical function after two to 36 months (lower score means worse function)
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their physical function to be 0.30 points lower on a scale of 0 to 24 after taking the medication for two to 36 months (0% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who took diacerein rated their physical function to be 9.3 on a scale of 0 to 24 after taking the medication compared to people who took a fake pill and rated their physical function to be 9 points on a scale of 0 to 24.
<ABS> Radiographic progression - how the joint looks on an x-ray (reduction in joint space narrowing of at least 0.5 mm)
<ABS> - Seven more people who took placebo had radiographic progression (absolute difference of 7%).
<ABS> - 42 of every 100 people who took diacerein experienced reduction in joint space narrowing of at least 0.5 mm compared to 49 of every 100 people who took a fake pill.
<ABS> Quality of life
<ABS> - The review authors found no studies about quality of life of people who took diacerein compared with placebo.
<ABS> - There was no difference in quality of life of people who took diacerein compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
<ABS> This may have happened by chance.
<ABS> Side effects
<ABS> - Twenty-six more people who took diacerein experienced diarrhoea as a side effect (absolute difference of 26%).
<ABS> - 36 of every 100 people who took diacerein experienced diarrhoea as a side effect compared to 10 of every 100 who took a fake pill.
<ABS> Diarrhoea was the most common side effect and usually occurred during the first two weeks after the start of diacerein.
<ABS> People who took diacerein were not more likely than people who took a placebo to stop taking the medication because of side effects.
<ABS> In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) recommended that the marketing authorisation of diacerein should be suspended across Europe because of harms outweighing benefits.
<ABS> However, this guidance is not final as the PRAC recommendation will be re-examined.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal diseases.
<INT> There is currently no consensus on what is the best treatment to improve OA symptoms and slow disease progression.
<INT> Diacerein is an anthraquinone synthesised in 1980 that interferes with interleukin-1, an inflammatory mediator.
<INT> It has been proposed that diacerein acts as a slow-acting, symptom-modifying and perhaps disease-structure-modifying drug for OA.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) - The Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 2013, MEDLINE (1966 to 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013), LILACS (1982 to 2013), and ACP Journal Club, and we handsearched reference lists of published articles.
<MaM> We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform ( http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to identify ongoing trials and screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.
<MaM> All searches were up to date as of March 2013.
<MaM> Pharmaceutical companies and authors of published articles were contacted.
<MaM> We searched the websites of the regulatory agencies using the keyword ‘diacerein’ in November 2013.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data abstraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent investigators, and their results were compared.
<MaM> The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used.
<MaM> The quality of evidence obtained was assessed using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified three new trials (141 participants), and this updated review now includes 10 trials, totalling 2,210 participants.
<RES> The most frequent risk of bias was incomplete outcome data, identified in approximately 80% of the studies.
<RES> Allocation concealment and random sequence generation were unclear in 90% and 40% of the studies, respectively, because of poor reporting.
<RES> Low-quality evidence from six trials (1,283 participants) indicates that diacerein has a small beneficial effect on overall pain (measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale) at three to 36 months (mean difference (MD) -8.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.62 to -1.68), which is equivalent to a 9% pain reduction in the diacerein group (95% CI -16% to -2%) compared with the placebo group.
<RES> This benefit may not be clinically significant.
<RES> No statistically significant differences in physical function (4 studies, 1006 participants) were noted between the diacerein and placebo groups (Lequesne impairment index, 0 to 24 points) (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.28).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from two trials (616 participants) on slowing of joint space narrowing (a decrease greater than 0.50 mm) in the knee or hip favoured diacerein over placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99), with an absolute risk difference of -6% (95% CI -15% to 2%) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 14 (95% CI 8 to 203).
<RES> Analysis of the knee joint alone (1 study, 170 participants) did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.74).
<RES> None of the trials of diacerein versus placebo measured quality of life.
<RES> According to one trial (161 participants), which compared diacerein versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the quality of life of participants in the two groups (as assessed by the Short Form (SF)-36 health survey questionnaire (0 to 800 sum score)) did not differ significantly (MD -40.70, 95% CI -85.20 to 3.80).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from seven trials showed significantly more adverse events in the diacerein group compared with the placebo group after two to 36 months, mainly diarrhoea (RR 3.52, 95% CI 2.42 to 5.11), with an absolute risk increase of 24% (95% CI 12% to 35%), and a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7).
<RES> No statistically significant differences in participant withdrawal due to adverse events were seen at two to 36 months for diacerein compared with placebo (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.01).
<RES> A search of regulatory websites found a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) that the marketing authorization of diacerein should be suspended across Europe because of harms (particularly the risk of severe diarrhoea and potentially harmful effects on the liver) outweighing benefits.
<RES> However, this guidance is not final as the PRAC recommendation will be re-examined.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In this update, the strength of evidence for effectiveness outcomes was low to moderate.
<CON> We confirmed that symptomatic benefit provided by diacerein in terms of pain reduction is minimal.
<CON> The small benefit derived in terms of joint space narrowing is of questionable clinical relevance and was observed only for OA of the hip.
<CON> With respect to adverse effects of diacerein, diarrhoea was most frequent.
<CON> Given the recent guidance issued by the EMA recommending suspension of diacerein in Europe, the EMA website should be consulted for further recommendations regarding the use of diacerein.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We examined the available evidence regarding occlusion treatment for stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) with respect to vision at the end of treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Amblyopia or 'lazy eye' occurs when vision does not develop normally in early childhood.
<ABS> Stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA), the type that occurs due to blockage of vision in the eye, for example by a cloudy lens or droopy eyelid, or unequal refractive error in the two eyes (unequal focus of the images, for example one eye is nearsighted and the other eye is farsighted).
<ABS> Eye doctors consider this type of amblyopia to be the most difficult to treat successfully.
<ABS> Although about 1% to 5% of people have some type of amblyopia, SDA is much less common, about 3% of all people with any type of amblyopia.
<ABS> Usually SDA is diagnosed after parents observe a whitish pupil or a droopy eyelid before a baby's first birthday.
<ABS> SDA is often diagnosed after the problem causing these signs is treated and refractive correction (for example, wearing spectacles) is prescribed.
<ABS> The goal of treatment of SDA is to improve vision in the affected eye and to provide stereopsis, that is, '3-D' vision and depth perception.
<ABS> Treatment may last for several months in order to assure that the affected eye gains as much vision as possible.
<ABS> Also, participation in sports and future employment may be affected by poor vision in one eye or loss of 3-D vision.
<ABS> A common treatment is to occlude or cover the unaffected eye, often with an adhesive patch, in order to force the amblyopic eye to be used.
<ABS> Because young children find occlusion confusing or uncomfortable, occlusion therapy may be difficult for their parents to implement.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomized controlled trials (trials in which participants are randomly assigned to one treatment group or another) that evaluated the effectiveness of occlusion therapy for SDA.
<ABS> Thus, well-designed research studies of SDA are needed before we have the information we need to make treatment decisions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Stimulus deprivation amblyopia (SDA) develops due to an obstruction to the passage of light secondary to a condition such as cataract.
<INT> The obstruction prevents formation of a clear image on the retina.
<INT> SDA can be resistant to treatment, leading to poor visual prognosis.
<INT> In developed countries, most patients present under the age of one year; in less developed parts of the world patients are likely to be older at the time of presentation.
<INT> The mainstay of treatment is removal of the cataract and then occlusion of the better-seeing eye, but regimens vary, can be difficult to execute, and traditionally are believed to lead to disappointing results.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of occlusion therapy for SDA in an attempt to establish realistic treatment outcomes.
<OBJ> Where data were available, we also planned to examine evidence of any dose response effect and to assess the effect of the duration, severity, and causative factor on the size and direction of the treatment effect.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 28 October 2013.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence on the effectiveness of any treatment for SDA.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Psychological interventions (for example, distraction, hypnosis, coping skills training) are treatments used to reduce pain and distress (anxiety and fear, or both) that children and adolescents experience while undergoing medical procedures involving needles.
<ABS> There is strong evidence that distraction and hypnosis are effective in reducing the pain and distress that children and adolescents experience during needle procedures.
<ABS> Distraction techniques can often be quite simple, such as reading the child stories, watching television, listening to music, or talking about something other than the needle.
<ABS> Sometimes parents or nurses are involved in helping to distract the child, although that is not always necessary.
<ABS> Interventions such as hypnosis may require some teaching by a trained professional for a child to learn.
<ABS> Other psychological treatments, such as explaining what is going to happen before or during the procedure (labelled 'providing information or preparation or both'), using virtual reality (for example, interactive video equipment, goggles, computers showing images, games, stories), or a combination of various strategies have been tested.
<ABS> More research is needed to know whether they are effective for reducing children's pain and distress during needles.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2006.
<INT> Needle-related procedures are a common source of pain and distress for children.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Searches of the following databases were conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; PsycINFO; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and Web of Science.
<MaM> Requests for relevant studies were also posted on various electronic list servers.
<MaM> We ran an updated search in March 2012, and again in March 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Participants included children and adolescents aged two to 19 years undergoing needle-related procedures.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality and a third author helped with data extraction and coding for one non-English study.
<MaM> Included studies were coded for quality using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool.
<MaM> Standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were computed for all analyses using Review Manager 5.2 software.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-nine trials with 3394 participants were included.
<RES> The most commonly studied needle procedures were venipuncture, intravenous (IV) line insertion, and immunization.
<RES> Studies included children aged two to 19 years, with the most evidence available for children under 12 years of age.
<RES> Consistent with the original review, the most commonly studied psychological interventions for needle procedures were distraction, hypnosis, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
<RES> The majority of included studies (19 of 39) examined distraction only.
<RES> The additional studies from this review update continued to provide strong evidence for the efficacy of distraction and hypnosis.
<RES> No evidence was available to support the efficacy of preparation and information, combined CBT (at least two or more cognitive or behavioural strategies combined), parent coaching plus distraction, suggestion, or virtual reality for reducing children's pain and distress.
<RES> No conclusions could be drawn about interventions of memory alteration, parent positioning plus distraction, blowing out air, or distraction plus suggestion, as evidence was available from single studies only.
<RES> In addition, the Risk of bias scores indicated several domains with high or unclear bias scores (for example, selection, detection, and performance bias) suggesting that the methodological rigour and reporting of RCTs of psychological interventions continue to have considerable room for improvement.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There are continuing issues with the quality of trials examining psychological interventions for needle-related pain and distress.

<H1> Selenium for preventing cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Selenium for preventing cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence suggesting that selenium can help to prevent cancer.
<ABS> This review updates the first Cochrane review on this topic (Dennert 2011).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Selenium is a naturally occurring element found in crops, animal products and water.
<ABS> Small amounts of selenium are needed for proper human nutrition.
<ABS> Starting in the 1960s, numerous studies reported that people with high levels of selenium in their diet or in their body tissues had lower rates of cancer.
<ABS> Some laboratory studies also suggested that selenium could inhibit the growth of cancer cells.
<ABS> This led to widespread interest and claims that taking selenium supplements could prevent cancer.
<ABS> Over the next decades, many more studies were conducted to compare cancer rates among individuals with high and low selenium levels, and several trials were conducted in which individuals were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo and then were followed so their cancer rates could be determined.
<ABS> Particular interest focused on whether selenium could prevent prostate, skin or other specific types of cancer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review includes 55 studies in which adults observed to have high or low selenium levels were followed over time to determine whether they developed cancer, along with eight trials in which adults were randomly assigned to receive selenium supplements or placebo.
<ABS> The evidence is current to February 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found limited evidence suggesting that individuals observed to have higher selenium levels have a lower incidence of cancer.
<ABS> However, it is not possible to conclude from these studies that selenium was the reason for the lower cancer risk, because a high selenium level might be associated with other factors that reduce cancer risk, such as a healthier diet or lifestyle.
<ABS> Also, selenium comes in many different chemical forms that have different biological activity, and these studies did not identify which chemical forms were being measured.
<ABS> Selenium levels in body tissues in which people might develop cancer (e.g. the prostate) also were not examined.
<ABS> The randomised controlled trials that assessed whether taking selenium supplements might prevent cancer differed considerably in methodological quality and are not equally reliable.
<ABS> Several studies reported that individuals receiving selenium supplements decreased their liver cancer risk, but these studies reported insufficient details about their randomisation process and participant follow-up to be convincing.
<ABS> Recent trials that were judged to be well conducted and reliable have found no effects of selenium on reducing the overall risk of cancer or on reducing the risk of particular cancers, including prostate cancer.
<ABS> In contrast, some trials suggest that selenium may increase the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, as well as of type 2 diabetes, raising concern about the safety of selenium supplements.
<ABS> Overall, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer.
<ABS> However, for a full understanding of the role of this metalloid in cancer development, more research is needed on how selenium may act differently in individuals with different genetic backgrounds or nutritional status, and on the different biological activities of the various selenium compounds, which are still largely unknown.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an update of the first Cochrane publication on selenium for preventing cancer (Dennert 2011).
<INT> Selenium is a metalloid with both nutritional and toxicological properties.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Two research questions were addressed in this review: What is the evidence for:

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to February 2013 week 1), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 6), CancerLit (February 2004) and CCMed (February 2011).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> For RCTs, we performed random effects meta-analyses when two or more studies were available.
<MaM> The risk of bias in observational studies was assessed using forms adapted from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies; the criteria specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were used to evaluate the risk of bias in RCTs.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 55 prospective observational studies (including more than 1,100,000 participants) and eight RCTs (with a total of 44,743 participants).
<RES> For the observational studies, we found lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.91, N = 8) and cancer mortality (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93, N = 6) associated with higher selenium exposure.
<RES> Gender-specific subgroup analysis provided no clear evidence of different effects in men and women (P value 0.47), although cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05, N = 6) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, N = 2).
<RES> The most pronounced decreases in risk of site-specific cancers were seen for stomach, bladder and prostate cancers.
<RES> However, these findings have limitations due to study design, quality and heterogeneity that complicate interpretation of the summary statistics.
<RES> Some studies suggested that genetic factors may modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk—a hypothesis that deserves further investigation.
<RES> In RCTs, we found no clear evidence that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.17, two studies, N = 4765) or cancer-related mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32, two studies, N = 18,698), and this finding was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to studies with low risk of bias.
<RES> The effect on prostate cancer was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.14, four studies, N = 19,110), and when the analysis was limited to trials with low risk of bias, the interventions showed no effect (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14, three studies, N = 18,183).
<RES> The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was increased (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17, three studies, N = 1900).
<RES> Results of two trials—the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT) and the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial (SELECT)—also raised concerns about possible increased risk of type 2 diabetes, alopecia and dermatitis due to selenium supplements.
<RES> An early hypothesis generated by NPCT that individuals with the lowest blood selenium levels at baseline could reduce their risk of cancer, particularly of prostate cancer, by increasing selenium intake has not been confirmed by subsequent trials.
<RES> As the RCT participants were overwhelmingly male (94%), gender differences could not be systematically assessed.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution.
<CON> These studies have many limitations, including issues with assessment of exposure to selenium and to its various chemical forms, heterogeneity, confounding and other biases.
<CON> Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types.
<CON> RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results, although the most recent studies, characterised by a low risk of bias, found no beneficial effect on cancer risk, more specifically on risk of prostate cancer, as well as little evidence of any influence of baseline selenium status.
<CON> Rather, some trials suggest harmful effects of selenium exposure.
<CON> To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Colorectal (large bowel) cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world.
<ABS> The risk of developing rectal cancer increases with age and is most common in people around 70 years of age.
<ABS> The treatment consists of complete surgical resection of the tumour and surrounding tissue by a technique called total mesorectal excision (TME), sometimes combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
<ABS> This surgery can be performed by either normal open abdominal surgery with a large incision or by keyhole laparoscopic surgery with several small incisions for the instruments and camera.
<ABS> For colon cancer, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results.
<ABS> These results are expected to be equal for rectal surgery.
<ABS> However, surgery for rectal cancer is technically more difficult than for colon cancer due to the location deeper in the pelvis and close to important nerves.
<ABS> In this updated review, we have assessed all randomised studies of laparoscopic and open TME for rectal cancer, to compare and combine their results.
<ABS> We included 14 trials reporting on a total of 3528 patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery.
<ABS> In 14.5% of those having laparoscopic surgery needed conversion to open surgery by a large incision in the abdomen due to difficulties or problems during the procedure.
<ABS> There is currently moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) has similar effects to open TME (OTME) on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer.
<ABS> The estimated effect was imprecise and further research could impact on our confidence int this result.
<ABS> There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay.
<ABS> We found that pain was lower in the LTME group and that resumption of diet was better.
<ABS> We did not find clear evidence of a difference in quality of life between the two groups, but costs were higher for LTME.
<ABS> We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to our understanding of the effects of these surgical approaches on long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Colorectal cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world.
<INT> For colon carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results with equal oncologic results.
<INT> These short-term benefits are expected to be similar for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery.
<INT> However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remained controversial due to the lack of definitive long-term results.
<INT> Thus, the expected short-term benefits can only be of interest when oncological results are at least equal.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1990 to February 2013), EMBASE (January 1990 to February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (February 2013).
<MaM> We handsearched the reference lists of the included articles for missed studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality according to the CONSORT statement, and resolved disagreements by discussion.
<MaM> We rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 45 references out of 953 search results, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3528 rectal cancer patients.
<RES> We did not consider the risk of bias of the included studies to have impacted on the quality of the evidence.
<RES> Data were analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle with a mean conversion rate of 14.5% (range 0% to 35%) in the laparoscopic group.There was moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic and open TME had similar effects on five-year disease-free survival (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.76 to1.38, 4 studies, N = 943).
<RES> The estimated effects of laparoscopic and open TME on local recurrence and overall survival were similar, although confidence intervals were wide, both with moderate quality evidence (local recurrence: OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.57 to1.39 and overall survival rate: OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.87 to1.52).
<RES> There was moderate to high quality evidence that the number of resected lymph nodes and surgical margins were similar between the two groups.For the short-term results, length of hospital stay was reduced by two days (95% CI -3.22 to -1.10), moderate quality evidence), and the time to first defecation was shorter in the LTME group (-0.86 days; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.54).
<RES> There was moderate quality evidence that 30 days morbidity were similar in both groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1).
<RES> The costs were higher for LTME with differences up to GBP 2000 for direct costs only.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We have found moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has similar effects to open TME on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer.
<CON> The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and further research could impact on our confidence in this result.
<CON> There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of recovery for non-locally advanced rectal cancer.
<CON> Currently results are consistent in showing a similar disease-free survival and overall survival, and for recurrences after at least three years and up to 10 years, although due to imprecision we cannot rule out superiority of either approach.
<CON> We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to a more robust analysis of long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, alone or in combination with thrombolytic agents, in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.
<ABS> Background: Most strokes are due to a sudden blockage of an artery in the brain (this type of stroke is called an ischaemic stroke).
<ABS> In most ischaemic strokes, the blockage is caused by a blood clot.
<ABS> Clots form because platelets circulating in the blood in determined conditions aggregate.
<ABS> Glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibitors are potent, fast and selective blockers of the platelet aggregation and, thus, might help to dissolve blood clots, prevent new clots from forming, and so improve the blood supply to the brain.
<ABS> However, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors can also cause bleeding in the brain, which are associated with poorer outcomes.
<ABS> This review aimed to evaluate whether GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors, administered within six hours from stroke onset, reduce the proportion of dead or dependent individuals.
<ABS> Key results: The results showed that GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors cause bleeding in the brain, and that this complication offset any benefits.
<ABS> Therefore, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors should be avoided in people with acute ischaemic stroke.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: Overall, the studies were considered at low risk of bias.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of individuals with acute coronary syndromes and during coronary angioplasty, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors could also be useful for the treatment of people with acute ischaemic stroke.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We wished to examine the effects GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors alone or in combination with thrombolytic agents.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched reference lists and contacted trial authors and pharmaceutical companies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Only individuals who started treatment within six hours of stroke onset were included.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials involving 1365 participants.
<RES> Three trials compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Abciximab with intravenous placebo (1215 participants) and one trial compared the intravenous GP IIb-IIIa inhibitor Tirofiban with intravenous aspirin (150 participants).
<RES> Treatment with either of these GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors did not significantly reduce long-term death or dependency (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.22, for the comparison between Abciximab and placebo; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.92, for the comparison between Tirofiban and aspirin) and had no effect on deaths from all causes (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.53, for the comparison between Abciximab and placebo; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.82, for the comparison between Tirofiban and aspirin).
<RES> Abciximab was associated with a significant increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 4.6, 95% CI 2.01 to 10.54) and with a non-significant increase in major extracranial haemorrhage (OR 1.81, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.41), whereas the only small trial comparing Tirofiban with aspirin showed no increased risk of bleeding complications with Tirofiban (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.19, for symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage; OR 3.04, 95% CI 0.12 to 75.83, for major extracranial haemorrhages).
<RES> There was no significant inconsistency across the studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The available trial evidence showed that, for individuals with acute ischaemic stroke, GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors are associated with a significant risk of intracranial haemorrhage with no evidence of any reduction in death or disability in survivors.
<CON> These data do not support their routine use in clinical practice.
<CON> The conclusion is driven by trials of Abciximab, which contributed 89% of the total number of study participants considered.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treatments to prevent or reduce damage to nerves from the anticancer (chemotherapy) drug cisplatin or other platinum-containing drugs.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cisplatin and other related platinum-containing drugs that are used to treat solid tumours are toxic to the peripheral nervous system.
<ABS> Most people who complete a full course of cisplatin chemotherapy develop a sensory neuropathy (damage to nerves that carry sensation).
<ABS> Symptoms can include tingling in the extremities and numbness.
<ABS> The neuropathy may only partially recover or not recover at all when the chemotherapy is stopped.
<ABS> To try to reduce the toxicity of platinum drugs, researchers have looked for therapies to protect the nerves.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We carried out a wide search for studies of treatments to prevent this type of nerve damage.
<ABS> We identified a total of 29 clinical trials, which involved almost 3000 participants who were receiving platinum-containing anticancer drugs (mostly cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) for various types of cancer (mainly colon, ovary, and lung cancers).
<ABS> The nine treatments studied were: amifostine (seven trials), calcium and magnesium (four trials), glutathione (seven trials), Org 2766 (four trials) and vitamin E (three trials).
<ABS> There was one trial each of acetylcysteine, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), oxcarbazepine, and retinoic acid.
<ABS> We chose an objective clinical test of sensation to report as our preferred measure of the effects of treatment.
<ABS> Only seven of the studies used this measure.
<ABS> Nine reported the results of nerve conduction studies which are another objective measure of nerve function.
<ABS> Most of the studies used a subjective assessment of neuropathy, such as the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) neuropathy grading scale.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most of the included studies were fairly well performed, where it was possible to obtain this information.
<ABS> Based on the combined results that generally described secondary and non-quantitative measures such as the NCI-CTC neuropathy grading scale, modest but promising (borderline statistically significant) results favoured the use of amifostine, calcium and magnesium, and glutathione to reduce the neurotoxicity of cisplatin and related chemotherapies.
<ABS> Three studies of vitamin E could only be studied individually but the results of each imply some mild subjective benefits.
<ABS> Nevertheless, given the limitations of the studies, such as small numbers of participants, lack of objective measures of neuropathy, and differing results among similar trials, the data remain insufficient to conclude that any of the neuroprotective agents tested prevent or limit the neurotoxicity of platinum drugs.
<ABS> Most of the treatments were not associated with adverse events.
<ABS> Amifostine infusions were associated with temporary low blood pressure in a significant number of cases, and retinoic acid with low levels of calcium in the blood.
<ABS> About one-fifth of people treated with DDTC stopped taking it because of harmful effects.
<ABS> Amifostine, calcium and magnesium, vitamin E, and glutathione require further well designed trials to clarify if they are effective or not.
<ABS> This is an updated review.
<ABS> The evidence is current to 4 March 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Effective neuroprotective therapies have been sought.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs in which the participants received chemotherapy with cisplatin or related compounds, with a potential chemoprotectant (acetylcysteine, amifostine, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), BNP7787, calcium and magnesium (Ca/Mg), diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), glutathione, Org 2766, oxcarbazepine, or vitamin E) compared to placebo, no treatment, or other treatments.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> As of 2013, the review includes 29 studies describing nine possible chemoprotective agents, as well as description of two published meta-analyses.
<RES> Among these trials, there were sufficient data in some instances to combine the results from different studies, most often using data from secondary non-quantitative measures.
<RES> Nine of the studies were newly included at this update.
<RES> Few of the included studies were at a high risk of bias overall, although often there was too little information to make an assessment.
<RES> At least two review authors performed a formal review of an additional 44 articles but we did not include them in the final review for a variety of reasons.
<RES> Of seven eligible amifostine trials (743 participants in total), one used quantitative sensory testing (vibration perception threshold) and demonstrated a favourable outcome in terms of amifostine neuroprotection, but the vibration perception threshold result was based on data from only 14 participants receiving amifostine who completed the post-treatment evaluation and should be regarded with caution.
<RES> Furthermore the change measured was subclinical.
<RES> None of the three eligible Ca/Mg trials (or four trials if a single retrospective study was included) described our primary outcome measures.
<RES> The four Ca/Mg trials included a total of 886 participants.
<RES> Of the seven eligible glutathione trials (387 participants), one used quantitative sensory testing but reported only qualitative analyses.
<RES> Four eligible Org 2766 trials (311 participants) employed quantitative sensory testing but reported disparate results; meta-analyses of three of these trials using comparable measures showed no significant vibration perception threshold neuroprotection.
<RES> The remaining trial reported only descriptive analyses.
<RES> Similarly, none of the three eligible vitamin E trials (246 participants) reported quantitative sensory testing.
<RES> The eligible single trials involving acetylcysteine (14 participants), diethyldithiocarbamate (195 participants), oxcarbazepine (32 participants), and retinoic acid (92 participants) did not perform quantitative sensory testing.
<RES> In all, this review includes data from 2906 participants.
<RES> However, only seven trials reported data for the primary outcome measure of this review, (quantitative sensory testing) and only nine trials reported our objective secondary measure, nerve conduction test results.
<RES> Additionally, methodological heterogeneity precluded pooling of the results in most cases.
<RES> Nonetheless, a larger number of trials reported the results of secondary (non-quantitative and subjective) measures such as the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) for neuropathy (15 trials), and these results we pooled and reported as meta-analysis.
<RES> Amifostine showed a significantly reduced risk of developing neurotoxicity NCI-CTC (or equivalent) ≥ 2 compared to placebo (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61).
<RES> Glutathione was also efficacious with an RR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.85).
<RES> In three vitamin E studies subjective measures not suitable for combination in meta analysis each favoured vitamin E. For other interventions the qualitative toxicity measures were either negative (N-acetyl cysteine, Ca/Mg, DDTC and retinoic acid) or not evaluated (oxcarbazepine and Org 2766).
<RES> Adverse events were infrequent or not reported for most interventions.
<RES> Amifostine was associated with transient hypotension in 8% to 62% of participants, retinoic acid with hypocalcaemia in 11%, and approximately 20% of participantss withdrew from treatment with DDTC because of toxicity.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> At present, the data are insufficient to conclude that any of the purported chemoprotective agents (acetylcysteine, amifostine, calcium and magnesium, diethyldithiocarbamate, glutathione, Org 2766, oxcarbazepine, retinoic acid, or vitamin E) prevent or limit the neurotoxicity of platin drugs among human patients, as determined using quantitative, objective measures of neuropathy.
<CON> Amifostine, calcium and magnesium, glutathione, and vitamin E showed modest but promising (borderline statistically significant) results favouring their ability to reduce the neurotoxicity of cisplatin and related chemotherapies, as measured using secondary, non-quantitative and subjective measures such as the NCI-CTC neuropathy grading scale.
<CON> Among these interventions, the efficacy of only vitamin E was evaluated using quantitative nerve conduction studies; the results were negative and did not support the positive findings based on the qualitative measures.
<CON> In summary, the present studies are limited by the small number of participants receiving any particular agent, a lack of objective measures of neuropathy, and differing results among similar trials, which make it impossible to conclude that any of the neuroprotective agents tested prevent or limit the neurotoxicity of platinum drugs.

<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are different treatments and what are the best timings for these treatments following accidental damage during surgery to the nerves that supply sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The nerves (alveolar and lingual) supplying sensation to the tongue, lower lip and chin, may be injured as a result of surgical treatments to the mouth and face, including surgery to remove lower wisdom teeth.
<ABS> The vast majority (90%) of these injuries are temporary and get better within eight weeks.
<ABS> However if they last for longer than six months they are considered to be permanent.
<ABS> Damage to these nerves can lead to altered sensation in the region of the lower lip and chin, or tongue or both.
<ABS> Furthermore, damage to the nerve supplying the tongue may lead to altered taste perception.
<ABS> These injuries can affect people's quality of life leading to emotional problems, problems with socialising and disabilities.
<ABS> Accidental injury after surgery can also give rise to legal action.
<ABS> There are many interventions or treatments available, surgical and non-surgical, that may enhance recovery, including improving sensation.
<ABS> They can be grouped as.
<ABS> 1.
<ABS> Surgical – a variety of procedures.2.
<ABS> Laser treatment – low-level laser treatment has been used to treat partial loss of sensation.3.
<ABS> Counselling – including cognitive behavioural and relaxation therapy, changing behaviour and hypnosis.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review, and the evidence is current as of 9 October 2013.
<ABS> There are two studies included, both published in 1996, which compared low-level laser treatment to placebo or fake treatment for partial loss of sensation following surgery to the lower jaw.
<ABS> There were 15 participants in one study and 16 in the other, their ages ranging from 17 to 55 years.
<ABS> All had suffered accidental damage to nerves of the lower jaw and tongue causing some loss of sensation following surgery.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Low-level laser therapy was the only treatment to be evaluated in the included studies and this was compared to fake or placebo laser therapy.
<ABS> No studies were found that evaluated other surgical, medical or counselling treatments.
<ABS> There was some evidence of an improvement when participants reported whether or not sensation was better in the lip and chin areas with low-level laser therapy.
<ABS> This is based on the results of a single, small study, so the results should be interpreted with caution.
<ABS> No studies reported on the effects of the treatment on other outcomes such as pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste.
<ABS> No studies reported on quality of life or harm.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence is very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the two included studies and the low number of participants, and evidence from participants with only partial sensory loss.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Iatrogenic injury of the inferior alveolar or lingual nerve or both is a known complication of oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures.
<INT> Injury to these two branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve may result in altered sensation associated with the ipsilateral lower lip or tongue or both and may include anaesthesia, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia, hyperalgesia, allodynia, hypoaesthesia and hyperaesthesia.
<INT> Injury to the lingual nerve may also affect taste perception on the affected side of the tongue.
<INT> The vast majority (approximately 90%) of these injuries are temporary in nature and resolve within eight weeks.
<INT> However, if the injury persists beyond six months it is deemed to be permanent.
<INT> Surgical, medical and psychological techniques have been used as a treatment for such injuries, though at present there is no consensus on the preferred intervention, or the timing of the intervention.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trial Register (to 9 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 9 October 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 October 2013).
<MaM> No language restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> We performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We contacted authors to clarify the inclusion criteria of the studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies assessed as at high risk of bias, reporting data from 26 analysed participants were included in this review.
<RES> The age range of participants was from 17 to 55 years.
<RES> Both trials investigated the effectiveness of low-level laser treatment compared to placebo laser therapy on inferior alveolar sensory deficit as a result of iatrogenic injury.
<RES> Patient-reported altered sensation was partially reported in one study and fully reported in another.
<RES> Following treatment with laser therapy, there was some evidence of an improvement in the subjective assessment of neurosensory deficit in the lip and chin areas compared to placebo, though the estimates were imprecise: a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the chin of 8.40 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 13.13) and a difference in mean change in neurosensory deficit of the lip of 21.79 cm (95% CI 5.29 to 38.29).
<RES> The overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was very low; the outcome data were fully reported in one small study of 13 patients, with differential drop-out in the control group, and patients suffered only partial loss of sensation.
<RES> No studies reported on the effects of the intervention on the remaining primary outcomes of pain, difficulty eating or speaking or taste.
<RES> No studies reported on quality of life or adverse events.
<RES> The overall quality of the evidence was very low as a result of limitations in the conduct and reporting of the studies, indirectness of the evidence and the imprecision of the results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is clearly a need for randomised controlled clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of surgical, medical and psychological interventions for iatrogenic inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Anxiety disorders are common.
<ABS> Overall, self-help with some support from a professional appears to be more effective than no treatment.
<ABS> Only half of the people who used self-help were better at the end of treatment, but self-help may still be considered effective because people with anxiety do not tend to get better without treatment.
<ABS> Self-help may be less effective than normal face-to-face therapy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problems.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Published and unpublished studies were considered without restriction by language or date.
<MaM> The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR) was searched all years to 1 January 2013.
<MaM> The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date).
<MaM> Complementary searches were carried out on Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 23 February 2013) and PsycINFO (1987 to February, Week 2, 2013), together with International trial registries (the trials portal of the World Health Organization (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov).
<MaM> Reference lists from previous meta-analyses and reports of randomised controlled trials were checked, and authors were contacted for unpublished data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One hundred and one studies with 8403 participants were included; 92 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis.
<RES> These trials compared several types of media-delivered interventions (with varying levels of support) with no treatment and with face-to-face interventions.
<RES> Inconsistency and risk of bias reduced our confidence in the overall results.
<RES> For the primary outcome of symptoms of anxiety, moderate-quality evidence showed medium effects compared with no intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.80; 72 studies, 4537 participants), and low-quality evidence of small effects favoured face-to-face therapy (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.09; 24 studies, 1360 participants).
<RES> The intervention was associated with greater response than was seen with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 2.34, 95% CI 1.81 to 3.03; 21 studies, 1547 participants) and was not significantly inferior to face-to-face therapy in these studies (RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.56 to 1.09; 10 studies, 575 participants), but the latter comparison included versions of therapies that were not as comprehensive as those provided in routine clinical practice.
<RES> Evidence suggested benefit for secondary outcome measures (depression, mental-health related disability, quality of life and dropout), but this evidence was of low to moderate quality.
<RES> Evidence regarding harm was lacking.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Self-help may be useful for people who are not able or are not willing to use other services for people with anxiety disorders; for people who can access it, face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy is probably clinically superior.
<CON> Economic analyses were beyond the scope of this review.
<CON> Important heterogeneity was noted across trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> After a stroke, people with high levels of sugar in their blood have increased mortality regardless of their age, how severe the stroke was, or what type of stroke they had.
<ABS> Insulin can reduce blood sugar levels.
<ABS> We do not know what the optimal level of blood sugar should be after a stroke.
<ABS> We searched for trials that compared usual care with intensive insulin treatment (trying to keep blood sugar levels within the normal range of 4 to 7.5 mmol/L) after stroke.
<ABS> We found 11 trials involving 1583 participants.
<ABS> Trying to keep the blood sugar level within a tight range immediately after a stroke did not improve the outcomes of neurological deficit and dependency.
<ABS> It did, however, significantly increase the chance of experiencing very low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which can be harmful and can cause brain damage and death.
<ABS> On balance, the trials did not show any benefit from intensive control of blood sugar levels after stroke.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched ongoing trials registers and SCOPUS.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We obtained a total of 1565 titles through the literature search.
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected the included articles and extracted the study characteristics, study quality, and data to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD) of outcome measures.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements by discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 11 RCTs involving 1583 participants (791 participants in the intervention group and 792 in the control group).
<RES> We found that there was no difference between the treatment and control groups in the outcomes of death or dependency (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23) or final neurological deficit (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.01).
<RES> The rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was higher in the intervention group (OR 14.6, 95% CI 6.6 to 32.2).
<RES> The number needed to treat was not significant for the outcomes of death and final neurological deficit.
<RES> The number needed to harm was nine for symptomatic hypoglycaemia.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Breast cancer accounts for one in 10 of all new cancer cases diagnosed and surgical removal of the breast is a common treatment approach.
<ABS> An infection of the surgical wound is often a complication of surgery and taking antibiotics just before the operation significantly reduces the chances of developing an infection.
<ABS> The review is not able to establish which antibiotic is most appropriate.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language or date restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of pre- and perioperative antibiotics for patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer were included.
<MaM> Primary outcomes were rates of surgical site infection (SSI) and adverse reactions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of eleven studies (2867 participants) were included in the review.
<RES> Ten studies evaluated preoperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic or placebo.
<RES> One study evaluated perioperative antibiotic compared with no antibiotic.
<RES> Pooling of the results demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively significantly reduce the incidence of SSI for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery without reconstruction (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.85).
<RES> Analysis of the single study comparing perioperative antibiotic with no antibiotic found no statistically significant effect of antibiotics on the incidence of SSI (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95).
<RES> No studies presented separate data for patients who underwent reconstructive surgery at the time of removal of the breast tumour.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Prophylactic antibiotics administered preoperatively reduce the risk of SSI in patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Babies born too early (premature babies) are often cared for in a fashion that minimizes physical activity to reduce stress and stress-related complications.
<ABS> However, lack of physical activity might lead to poor bone development and growth, as seen in bedridden children and adults.
<ABS> It is believed that physical activity programs (moving and pressing all joints on all limbs for several minutes a day) may promote bone development and growth in premature babies.
<ABS> This review found that physical activity might provide a small benefit for bone development and growth over a short term.
<ABS> Data were inadequate to allow assessment of long-term benefits and harms.
<ABS> Based on current knowledge, physical activity programs cannot be recommended as a standard procedure for premature babies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Physical activity programs combined with adequate nutrition might help to promote bone mineralization and growth.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective was to assess whether physical activity programs in preterm infants improve bone mineralization and growth and reduce the risk of fracture.
<OBJ> The secondary objectives included other potential benefits in terms of length of hospital stay, skeletal deformities and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and adverse events.
<OBJ> Subgroup analysis:
<OBJ> • Given that the smallest infants are most vulnerable for developing osteopenia (Bishop 1999), a subgroup analysis was planned for infants with birth weight < 1000 g.
<OBJ> • Calcium and phosphorus intake may affect an infant's ability to increase bone mineral content (Kuschel 2004).
<OBJ> Therefore, an additional subgroup analysis was planned for infants receiving different amounts of calcium and phosphorus, along with full enteral feeds as follows.
<OBJ> ∘ Below 100 mg/60 mg calcium/phosphorus or equal to/above 100 mg/60 mg calcium/phosphorus per 100 mL milk.
<OBJ> ∘ Supplementation of calcium without phosphorus.
<OBJ> ∘ Supplementation of phosphorus without calcium.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) was used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials enrolling 324 preterm infants (gestational age 26 to 34 weeks) were included in this review.
<RES> All were small (N = 16 to 50) single-center studies that evaluated daily physical activity for three and one-half to eight weeks during initial hospitalization.
<RES> Methodological quality and reporting of included trials were variable.
<RES> Four trials demonstrated moderate short-term benefits of physical activity for bone mineralization at completion of the physical activity program.
<RES> The only trial assessing long-term effects on bone mineralization showed no effect of physical activity administered during initial hospitalization on bone mineralization at 12 months corrected age.
<RES> Meta-analysis from four trials demonstrated a positive effect of physical activity on daily weight gain (weighted mean difference (WMD) 2.21 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.19).
<RES> Data from four trials showed a positive effect on linear growth (WMD 0.12 cm/wk, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.24) but not on head growth (WMD -0.03 cm/wk, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.08) during the study period.
<RES> Only one trial reported on fractures (this outcome did not occur in intervention and control groups) and complications of preterm birth (no significant differences between intervention and control groups).
<RES> None of the trials assessed other outcomes relevant to this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Some evidence suggests that physical activity programs might promote short-term weight gain and bone mineralization in preterm infants.
<CON> Data are inadequate to allow assessment of harm or long-term effects.
<CON> Current evidence does not support the routine use of physical activity programs in preterm infants.
<CON> Further trials incorporating infants with a high baseline risk of osteopenia are required.
<CON> These trials should address adverse events, long-term outcomes, and the effects of nutritional intake (calories, protein, calcium, phosphorus).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Seizures (epileptic attacks) after stroke are a major clinical problem.
<ABS> It is unclear whether antiepileptic drugs are effective in preventing seizures after stroke in adults.
<ABS> This review searched in August 2013 for high quality evidence to help clarify this problem.
<ABS> We found only one high quality clinical trial that looked at whether antiepileptic drugs may be more effective than placebo in preventing seizures after stroke.
<ABS> Study Characteristics
<ABS> The only study that was included in this review was Gilad 2011.
<ABS> This was a prospective randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial studying the efficacy of valproic acid versus placebo in the primary prevention of seizure in 72 adults (over 18 years of age) with spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.
<ABS> Patients were randomly allocated to either the treatment or the placebo group with active treatment lasting one month; the primary outcome was seizure occurrence at one year.
<ABS> People with very early seizures (within 24 hours of onset of haemorrhage) were excluded from the study.
<ABS> Seizure was diagnosed on the basis of eye-witness evidence from staff, relatives or other eye witnesses.
<ABS> Quality Of The Evidence
<ABS> There does not appear to be bias in Gilad 2011, on the basis of the information available within the study.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> Gilad 2011 did not show a statistically significant benefit when comparing valproic acid with placebo for the primary prevention of seizures after spontaneous non-aneurysmal, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.
<ABS> Currently, therefore, there is not enough evidence to justify the routine use of antiepileptic drugs to prevent seizures after stroke (evidence current to 08/2013).
<ABS> Further research is needed for this important clinical problem.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2010, Issue 1.
<INT> Seizures after stroke are an important clinical problem, and they may be associated with poor outcome.
<INT> The effects of antiepileptic drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of seizures after stroke remain unclear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Specialised Registers of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group (12 August 2013) and the Cochrane Stroke Group (12 August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7), and MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to 12 August 2013).
<MaM> We also checked the reference lists of articles retrieved from these searches.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We included only one study for data collection and analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found only one trial that fulfilled the study inclusion criteria of comparison of the effects of an antiepileptic drug with placebo (or no drug) for the primary or secondary prevention of seizures after stroke.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further well-conducted research is needed for this important clinical problem.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Lipid-lowering agents for nephrotic syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Nephrotic syndrome is a relatively rare disease in which the kidneys leak protein into the urine.
<ABS> A common early sign is swelling in the feet and face.
<ABS> Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include low levels of protein in the blood, and high levels of fats in the blood, particularly cholesterol and triglycerides.
<ABS> Managing nephrotic syndrome includes therapies to reduce fats (lipids) in the blood.
<ABS> Several types of lipid-lowering agents including statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and ezetimibe can be used.
<ABS> We looked for evidence from RCTs to establish if lipid-lowering drugs were beneficial for people with nephrotic syndrome.
<ABS> We found five small studies that investigated four different lipid-lowering drugs (simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, gemfibrozil) in 203 participants with nephrotic syndrome.
<ABS> There is currently not enough high quality evidence from published studies to determine if lipid-lowering agents are helpful in managing dyslipidaemia in people with nephrotic syndrome.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Nephrotic syndrome is the collective name given to a group of symptoms that include proteinuria, lipiduria, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, hypercholesterolaemia, elevated triglycerides, and hyperlipidaemia.
<INT> Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease.
<INT> Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases.
<INT> In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia.
<INT> However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain.
<INT> Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> Statistical analyses were performed using a random effects model.
<MaM> Dichotomous results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> For continuous measures mean difference (MD) was used, or the standardised mean difference (SMD) where different scales had been used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five RCTs enrolling a total of 203 participants.
<RES> Of these, four studies compared statins with no treatment or placebo, and one compared fibrates with placebo.
<RES> We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment.
<RES> Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias.
<RES> Most outcomes were supported by single study data.
<RES> Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06).
<RES> No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred.
<RES> One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided).
<RES> Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).
<RES> One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> High quality RCTs need to be conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for people with nephrotic syndrome.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute diarrhoea, typically due to bacterial or viral infection, is a common childhood illness and, in low-income countries, remains an important cause of death.
<ABS> Over two million children under five years of age die each year in poorer countries because of acute diarrhoea.
<ABS> In richer countries, it does not usually cause death but it is a common reason for young children needing medical advice or hospital admission.
<ABS> Young children with acute diarrhoea may temporarily be unable to digest lactose, the most common type of sugar in milk.
<ABS> Inability to digest and absorb lactose can make the diarrhoea worse and last longer.
<ABS> We looked for evidence that reducing children's lactose intake, either by feeding lactose-free milk or by diluting lactose-containing milk, shortens the duration of diarrhoea and prevents complications such as dehydration.
<ABS> We looked for research up to 13 May 2013 and included 33 trials in our analyses.
<ABS> Twenty-two trials compared outcomes for children given a lactose-free feed with those for children given a lactose-containing feed and 11 trials compared outcomes for children fed a diluted milk feed with those for children given an undiluted milk feed.
<ABS> We found evidence that feeds that do not contain lactose may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (low quality evidence).
<ABS> Lactose-free feeds probably lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> We did not find any evidence that diluted milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea (low quality evidence) but these feeds may lower the risk of children having prolonged or worsening diarrhoea (low quality evidence).
<ABS> The majority of trials excluded breast fed infants, and none were conducted in low-income countries where diarrhoea can cause death, so the review is relevant to infants and young children who are receiving formula or are weaned in high- and middle-income countries.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction.
<MaM> Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR).
<MaM> We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea.
<RES> Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries.
<RES> Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed.
<RES> Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding.
<CON> There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Importance of the review/background on the condition
<ABS> Liver damage can lead to liver failure and other complications, including liver cancer.
<ABS> The goal of treatment of chronic hepatitis C is to prevent complications of hepatitis C infection; this could possibly be achieved by clearing the virus from the blood of the patient (sustained virological response, that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment).
<ABS> However, we still need to understand whether the sustained virological response outcome induced by antiviral treatment has any association with patient-relevant and clinically relevant outcomes.
<ABS> A combination of weekly injections of peginterferon and oral ribavirin represents the current standard of care.
<ABS> Main findings of the review
<ABS> If we disregard bias from lack of blinding and industry support, then 14 trials were considered to have a lower risk of bias.
<ABS> All trials were able to inform on clearing virus from blood six months after the end of treatment (sustained virological response).
<ABS> We could not be certain that peginterferon plus ribavirin has an effect on liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality when compared with interferon plus ribavirin.
<ABS> Because so few events occurred, we cannot exclude major beneficial or detrimental effects.
<ABS> This review shows that peginterferon plus ribavirin compared with interferon plus ribavirin significantly increases the number of patients with sustained virological response (50.2% compared with 38.5%), but we do not yet know about any patient-relevant outcomes.
<ABS> Adverse effects
<ABS> Peginterferon plus ribavirin compared with interferon plus ribavirin significantly increased the risk of adverse events such as neutropenia (lack of white blood cells in the blood), thrombocytopenia (lack of blood platelets in the blood), arthralgia (joint pain), injection site reaction, and nausea, but adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation remained comparable for both treatments (12.3% versus 18.7%).
<ABS> Data about the influence of treatment on quality of life are insufficient.
<ABS> Limitations of the review
<ABS> This effect on virological response seems robust to analysis controlling for the risk of random errors ('play of chance'), but it may be due to the fact that all trials were considered at high risk of bias.
<ABS> Furthermore, we still need to have proof that sustained virological response induced by antiviral treatment has any association with patient-relevant and clinically relevant outcomes.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index-Expanded, and LILACS.
<MaM> We also searched conference abstracts, journals, and grey literature.
<MaM> The last searches were conducted in September 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Our primary outcomes were liver-related morbidity, all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, other adverse events, and quality of life.
<MaM> Our secondary outcome was sustained virological response in serum, that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitive tests six months after the end of treatment.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently used a standardised data collection form.
<MaM> We meta-analysed data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) (for liver-related morbidity or all-cause mortality) or the risk ratio (RR) along with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis.
<MaM> We used domains of the trials to assess the risk of systematic errors (bias) and trial sequential analyses to assess the risk of random errors (play of chance).
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the RR with 95% CI based on intention-to-treat analysis.
<MaM> Effects of interventions on outcomes were assessed according to GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 27 randomised trials with 5938 participants.
<RES> All trials had high risk of bias.
<RES> We considered that the risk of bias did not impact on the quality of evidence for liver-related mortality and adverse event outcomes, but it did for virological response.
<RES> The effect observed between the two intervention groups regarding liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality (5/907 (0.55%) versus 4/882 (0.45%) was imprecise: OR 1.14 ( 95% CI 0.38 to 3.42; five trials; low quality of evidence), as was the risk of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (332/2692 (12.3%) versus 409/2176 (18.8%); RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.09; 15 trials; low quality of evidence) or regarding adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (332/2692 (12.3%) versus 409/2176 (18.8%); RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.12; 17 trials; low quality of evidence).
<RES> However, peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin significantly increased the risk of neutropenia (332/2202 (15.1%) versus 117/1653 (7.1%); RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.76 to 2.61; 13 trials), thrombocytopenia (65/1113 (5.8%) versus 23/1082 (2.1%); RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.11; 10 trials), arthralgia (517/1740 (29.7%) versus 282/1194 (23.6%); RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.35; four trials), injection site reaction (627/1168 (53.7%) versus 186/649 (28.7%); RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.93; four trials), and nausea (606/1784 (34.0%) versus 354/1239 (28.6%); RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.26; four trials).
<RES> The most frequent adverse event was fatigue, which occurred in 57% of participants (2024/3608).
<RES> No significant difference was noted between peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin in terms of fatigue (1177/2062 (57.1%) versus 847/1546 (54.8%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07; 12 trials).
<RES> No significant differences were reported between the two treatment groups regarding anaemia, headache, rigours, myalgia, pyrexia, weight loss, asthenia, depression, insomnia, irritability, alopecia, pruritus, skin rash, thyroid malfunction, decreased appetite, or diarrhoea.
<RES> We were unable to identify any data on quality of life.
<RES> Peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin seemed to significantly increase the number of participants achieving sustained virological response (1673/3300 participants (50.7%) versus 1081/2804 patients (36.7%); RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.56; I2 = 64%; 27 trials; very low quality of evidence).
<RES> However, the risk of bias in the 13/27 (48.1%) trials reporting on this outcome was high and was considered only 'lower' in the remainder.
<RES> Because the conventional meta-analysis did not reach its required information size (n = 14,486 participants), we used trial sequential analysis to control for risks of random errors.
<RES> Again, in this analysis, the estimated effect was statistically significant in favour of peginterferon.
<RES> Subgroup analyses according to risk of bias, viral genotype, baseline viral load, past treatment history, and type of intervention yielded similarly significant results favouring peginterferon over interferon on the outcome of sustained virological response.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin seems to significantly increase the proportion of patients with sustained virological response, as well as the risk of certain adverse events.
<CON> However, we have insufficient evidence to recommend or reject peginterferon plus ribavirin for liver-related morbidity plus all-cause mortality compared with interferon plus ribavirin.
<CON> The clinical consequences of achieved sustained virological response are unknown, as sustained virological response is still an unvalidated surrogate outcome.
<CON> We found no evidence of the potential benefits on quality of life in patients with achieved sustained virological response.
<CON> There is evidence that it also increases the risk of certain adverse events.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for osteoporosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We conducted a review of the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for people with primary osteoporosis.
<ABS> We found 108 studies with 10,655 people.
<ABS> Background: what is primary osteoporosis and what are Chinese herbal medicines?
<ABS> Bone is a living, growing part of your body.
<ABS> Throughout your lifetime, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone.
<ABS> When you have osteoporosis, the old bone breaks down faster than the new bone can replace it.
<ABS> As this happens, the bones lose minerals (such as calcium).
<ABS> This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury, like a little bump or fall.
<ABS> Chinese herbal medicines are products made from any part of medicinal plants (leaves, stems, buds, flowers or roots).
<ABS> Sometimes non-plant based components (for example insects, deer horn, snake, various shells and powdered fossil) are included.
<ABS> These can be used in the form of raw plant materials, or water or alcohol extracts of raw plant materials.
<ABS> Herbs can also be taken by mouth as capsules, tablets or liquids, or as injections.
<ABS> Chinese herbal medicines are widely used in China for primary osteoporosis but their benefits and harms have not been appraised in order to inform clinical practice.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies up to January 2013, we found 108 studies with 10,655 people with osteoporosis.
<ABS> Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medicine were compared with conventional medicine (47 trials).
<ABS> The average length of treatment was 5.7 months (ranging from 3 to 12 months).
<ABS> Key results: what happens to people with osteoporosis who take Chinese herbal medicines?
<ABS> New fractures
<ABS> We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture.
<ABS> Seven trials evaluated the incidence of fractures.
<ABS> However, these trials were small and had flaws in their methods.
<ABS> Quality of life
<ABS> People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 5.30 points better on a scale of 0 to 100 after three months compared to people who did not take the herbal medicine.
<ABS> People who took Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 56.05 on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> People who took calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol rated their quality of life to be 50.75 on a scale of 0 to 100.
<ABS> Serious side effects or deaths
<ABS> No serious side effects or deaths occurred in the trials.
<ABS> We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications.
<ABS> This is particularly true for rare but serious side effects.
<ABS> Possible side effects may include a mild stomach ache or diarrhoea.
<ABS> Bone mineral density (the amount and type of minerals in the bone)
<ABS> We found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines with placebo (fake treatment), with no treatment and with conventional medicine.
<ABS> We also found studies that compared Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication with just conventional medication.
<ABS> Compared to placebo (fake treatment), three studies showed that bone mineral density increased slightly with Chinese herbal medicines.
<ABS> Compared to no treatment or conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density with Chinese herbal medicines while others did not.
<ABS> When Chinese herbal medicines plus conventional medication was compared with just conventional medicine, some studies showed an increase in bone mineral density while others did not.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> In people with osteoporosis:
<ABS> - Chinese herbal medicines may improve bone mineral density and quality of life slightly.
<ABS> Further research is likely to change this estimate of how Chinese herbal medicines affect bone mineral density and quality of life.
<ABS> - We are uncertain whether Chinese herbal medicines reduce the chance of having a new bone fracture.
<ABS> - No trial reported death or serious side effects.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chinese herbal medicines have been used for a long time to treat osteoporosis.
<INT> The evidence of their benefits and harms needs to be systematically reviewed.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently.
<MaM> Disagreement was resolved by discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One hundred and eight randomised trials involving 10,655 participants were included.
<RES> Ninety-nine different Chinese herbal medicines were tested and compared with placebo (three trials), no intervention (five trials) or conventional medicine (61 trials), or Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine were compared with western medicine (47 trials).
<RES> The risk of bias across all studies was unclear for most domains primarily due to inadequate reporting of study design.
<RES> Although we rated the risk of selective reporting for all studies as unclear, only a few studies contributed numerical data to the key outcomes.
<RES> Seven trials reported fracture incidence, but they were small in sample size, suffered from various biases and tested different Chinese herbal medicines.
<RES> These trials compared Kanggusong capsules versus placebo, Kanggusong granule versus Caltrate or ipriflavone plus Caltrate, Yigu capsule plus calcium versus placebo plus calcium, Xianlinggubao capsule plus Caltrate versus placebo plus Caltrate, Bushen Zhuanggu granules plus Caltrate versus placebo granules plus Caltrate, Kanggusong soup plus Caltrate versus Caltrate, Zhuangguqiangjin tablets and Shujinbogu tablets plus calcitonin ampoule versus calcitonin ampoule.
<RES> The results were inconsistent.
<RES> One trial showed that Bushenhuoxue therapy plus calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol had a better effect on quality of life score (scale 0 to 100, higher is better) than calcium carbonate tablets and alfacalcidol (mean difference (MD) 5.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.67 to 6.93).
<RES> Compared with conventional medicine in 61 trials, 23 showed that Chinese herbal medicines had a statistically significant effect on increase in BMD.
<RES> In 48 trials evaluating Chinese herbal medicines plus western medication against western medication, 26 showed better effects of the combination therapy on increase in BMD.
<RES> No trial reported death or serious adverse events of Chinese herbal medicines, while some trials reported minor adverse effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, etc.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pressure ulcers (also known as pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue, believed to be caused by pressure, shear or friction.
<ABS> Pressure-relieving devices such as beds, mattresses, heel troughs, splints and pillows are used as part of the treatment to reduce or relieve the pressure on the ulcer.
<ABS> Heel ulcers were studied specifically as their structure is very different to the other body sites which are prone to pressure ulcers (such as the bottom) and they are more prone to diseases, such as poor circulation, which do not affect other pressure ulcer sites.
<ABS> We identified one study that was at moderate to high risk of bias.
<ABS> This study lost over half the participants to follow up.
<ABS> More high quality research is needed to inform the selection of pressure relieving devices to treat pressure ulcers of the heel.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pressure ulcers are areas of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue caused by pressure or shear.
<INT> Pressure redistribution devices are used as part of the treatment to reduce the pressure on the ulcer.
<INT> The anatomy of the heel and the susceptibility of the foot to vascular disease mean that pressure ulcers located there require a particular approach to pressure relief.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In May 2013, for this first update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid EMBASE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); and EBSCO CINAHL.
<MaM> No language or publication date restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Interventions were any pressure-relieving devices including mattresses and specific heel devices.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Both review authors independently extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In our original review, only one study met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> We did not find any further relevant studies during this first update.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> More research is needed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Probiotics for prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious disease that affects the bowel of premature infants in the first few weeks of life.
<ABS> Although the cause of NEC is not entirely known, milk feeding and bacterial growth play a role.
<ABS> Probiotics (dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacteria or yeast) have been used to prevent NEC.
<ABS> Our review of studies found that the use of probiotics reduces the occurrence of NEC and death in premature infants born weighing less than 1500 grams.
<ABS> There is insufficient data with regard to the benefits and potential adverse effects in the most at risk infants weighing less than 1000 grams at birth.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and nosocomial sepsis are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in preterm infants.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials were included if they involved enteral administration of any live microbial supplement (probiotics) and measured at least one prespecified clinical outcome.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-four eligible trials were included.
<RES> Included trials were highly variable with regard to enrolment criteria (that is birth weight and gestational age), baseline risk of NEC in the control groups, timing, dose, formulation of the probiotics, and feeding regimens.
<RES> In a meta-analysis of trial data, enteral probiotics supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of severe NEC (stage II or more) (typical relative risk (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.56; 20 studies, 5529 infants) and mortality (typical RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.81; 17 studies, 5112 infants).
<RES> There was no evidence of significant reduction of nosocomial sepsis (typical RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03; 19 studies, 5338 infants).
<RES> The included trials reported no systemic infection with the supplemental probiotics organism.
<RES> Probiotics preparations containing either lactobacillus alone or in combination with bifidobacterium were found to be effective.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Enteral supplementation of probiotics prevents severe NEC and all cause mortality in preterm infants.
<CON> Our updated review of available evidence strongly supports a change in practice.
<CON> Head to head comparative studies are required to assess the most effective preparations, timing, and length of therapy to be utilized.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is: what is the best method for preparing the enamel on the surface of teeth so as to improve the bonding (sticking) of fixed orthodontic braces?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many people need to wear fixed orthodontic devices, such as braces, to correct problems with the teeth and jaw (e.g. overcrowding or front teeth that stick out (protrude) or go too far backwards (retroclined)).
<ABS> How these braces are fixed in place will be of interest to them.
<ABS> In order to attach an orthodontic device, such as a brace, to a tooth, the surface of the appropriate tooth first needs to be prepared so that it can retain the glue or bonding agent used to enable the device to be attached securely.
<ABS> For the past 50 years, the usual way of doing this has been to etch (roughen) the surface of the tooth with acid, commonly phosphoric acid, although maleic acid or polyacrylic acid are also sometimes used.
<ABS> Possible harms of etching include the permanent loss of enamel (hard surface) from the surface of the tooth making it more likely for it to lose calcium or weaken during and after treatment.
<ABS> Recently, to reduce the length of time and complexity of the process, a technique using self etching primers (SEPs) has been developed as an alternative to conventional etchants or acids.
<ABS> However, whether SEPs or conventional etchants are better, and the best SEP, acid, concentration and etching time, remain to be determined.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The Cochrane Oral Health Group carried out this review of existing studies, which includes evidence current up to 8 March 2013.
<ABS> This review includes 13 published studies in which a total of 417 children and adults randomly received different tooth preparations before fixed orthodontic braces were bonded to their teeth.
<ABS> Eleven of these studies compared SEPs with conventional etching, and two compared two different SEPs.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Only five of the studies provided usable evidence for this review and the combined results did not enable a conclusion to be made about whether or not there is a difference in bond failure (when the orthodontic fixings come away from the tooth) between SEPs and conventional etching.
<ABS> There was also no usable evidence to suggest whether SEPs or conventional etchants lead to less decay around the etching site, or are associated with fewer costs or better participant satisfaction.
<ABS> There was also no usable evidence to enable conclusions to be drawn about which was the best SEP, acid, concentration or etching time.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is of low quality due to issues with the way in which some of the studies were conducted.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Various types of orthodontic etchants and etching techniques have been introduced in the past five decades.
<INT> Although a large amount of information on this topic has been published, there is a significant lack of consensus regarding the clinical effects of different dental etchants and etching techniques.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 8 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), EMBASE via OVID (to 8 March 2013), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to 12 March 2011), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to 8 March 2013) and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry (to 8 March 2013).
<MaM> There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements by discussion among the review team.
<MaM> We contacted the corresponding authors of the included studies to obtain additional information, if necessary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 studies randomizing 417 participants with 7184 teeth/brackets.
<RES> We assessed two studies (15%) as being at low risk of bias, 10 studies (77%) as being at high risk of bias and one study (8%) as being at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> Self etching primers (SEPs) versus conventional etchants
<RES> Eleven studies compared the effects of SEPs with conventional etchants.
<RES> Only five of these studies (three of split-mouth design and two of parallel design) reported data at the participant level, with the remaining studies reporting at the tooth level, thus ignoring clustering/the paired nature of the data.
<RES> A meta-analysis of these five studies, with follow-up ranging from 5 to 37 months, provided low-quality evidence that was insufficient to determine whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and convention etchants (risk ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.73; 221 participants).
<RES> The uncertainty in the CI includes both no effect and appreciable benefit and harm.
<RES> Subgroup analysis did not show a difference between split-mouth and parallel studies.
<RES> There were no data available to allow assessment of the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.
<RES> One study reported decalcification, but only at the tooth level.
<RES> SEPs versus SEPs
<RES> Two studies compared two different SEPs.
<RES> Both studies reported bond failure rate, with one of the studies also reporting decalcification.
<RES> However, as both studies reported outcomes only at the tooth level, there were no data available to evaluate the superiority of any of the SEPs over the others investigated with regards to any of the outcomes of this review.
<RES> We did not find any eligible studies evaluating different etching materials (e.g. phosphoric acid, polyacrylic acid, maleic acid), concentrations or etching times.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found low-quality evidence that was insufficient to conclude whether or not there is a difference in bond failure rate between SEPs and conventional etching systems when bonding fixed orthodontic appliances over a 5- to 37-month follow-up.
<CON> Insufficient data were also available to allow any conclusions to be formed regarding the superiority of SEPs or conventional etching for the outcomes: decalcification, participant satisfaction and cost-effectiveness, or regarding the superiority of different etching materials, concentrations or etching times, or of any one SEP over another.
<CON> Further well-designed RCTs on this topic are needed to provide more evidence in order to answer these clinical questions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Use of pregabalin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs can reduce the frequency of seizures, but has some adverse effects.
<ABS> The overall evidence for reducing seizures was rated as moderate in quality.
<ABS> Approximately one in 400 people have epileptic seizures that continue despite antiepileptic drug treatment.
<ABS> This review summarises data from six trials that included a total of 2009 participants.
<ABS> In addition to their usual antiepileptic drugs, participants were randomised to take pregabalin (an antiepileptic drug) or control drug.
<ABS> Results showed that patients taking pregabalin were two to three times more likely to reduce their seizure frequency by more than 50% than those taking placebo and two to three times more likely to increase seizure freedom over a 12-week interval.
<ABS> Pregabalin was shown to be effective across a range of doses (150 mg to 600 mg) with increasing effectiveness at higher doses.
<ABS> There was also an increasing likelihood of treatment withdrawal.
<ABS> Side effects associated with pregabalin included co-ordination problems, dizziness, sleepiness, and weight gain.
<ABS> All included studies were rated as low or unclear in risk of bias.
<ABS> Overall, the risk of bias was rated as unclear due to a suspicion of publication bias.
<ABS> Publication bias may occur when studies that report non-significant findings are not published.
<ABS> In this review, authors suspected this bias because all the included studies showed significant findings and they were all sponsored by the same drug company.
<ABS> Evidence was further rated as moderate in quality for the primary outcome of seizure reduction.
<ABS> A limitation of this review is that there are no data regarding the longer-term effectiveness of pregabalin and this should be investigated in future studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the UK.
<INT> Approximately one third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment.
<INT> In order to try to improve outcomes a number of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed and pregabalin is one of these.
<INT> This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (Pulman 2008); no further studies have been added since the previous update in 2012 and only one study has been identified as an ongoing trial.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on antiepileptic treatment in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
<OBJ> The definitions of drug resistance used were those employed by the authors of the included trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (JP and AGM) independently selected and assessed suitable trials and extracted data.
<MaM> Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat (ITT).
<MaM> Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Included studies were assessed for risk of bias by two authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six suitable industry-sponsored trials (2009 participants) were identified and included in the analysis.
<RES> Trials tested doses of pregabalin ranging from 50 mg/day to 600 mg/day.
<RES> For the primary outcome, 50% or higher seizure reduction was significantly more likely in patients randomised to pregabalin than to placebo (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.01).
<RES> A dose-response analysis suggested increasing effect with increasing dose.
<RES> Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.05 to 6.36).
<RES> Patients were significantly more likely to have withdrawn from pregabalin treatment than placebo treatment for any reason (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.72) or for adverse effects (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86).
<RES> Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain were significantly associated with pregabalin.
<RES> The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.54).
<RES> Overall, the evidence was rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to the possibility of publication bias.
<RES> The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate using the GRADE approach.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant partial epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at achieving a 50% or greater seizure reduction and significantly increasing seizure freedom.
<CON> Results demonstrate efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses.
<CON> The trials included in this review were of short duration and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making better.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, addressed the question of how effective tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are compared with conventional amalgam fillings when placed directly into cavities in permanent teeth in the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> There is controversy over the best materials to use when restoring or filling holes caused by tooth decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Amalgam fillings have been successfully used for over 150 years and are cost effective.
<ABS> However, their use has declined over recent years partly because of the way they look and because of the perceived risk of mercury that is used in them.
<ABS> Tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are frequently used in the front teeth and also in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 22 October 2013.
<ABS> We searched scientific databases and found seven studies to include in this review comparing composite resin fillings with amalgam fillings and we included two of these studies in the main analysis.
<ABS> Study centers were located in the UK, USA, Portugal, Sweden, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The main result including only two studies in 921 children suggests that amalgam fillings had lower failure rates than tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings used to fill holes caused by decay in permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> The other five studies only reported the rate of failure of the fillings and the amount of further tooth decay occurring next to or under the fillings (secondary caries) and the results supported those of the two studies above.
<ABS> The results suggest that tooth-colored (composite resin) fillings are almost twice as likely to fail compared with amalgam fillings when used for filling permanent teeth at the back of the mouth.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was low to moderate.
<ABS> Because there was an obvious difference in the color of the fillings, it was not possible to do the comparisons 'blind' so there was, therefore, a high risk of bias.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In recent times, however, there have been concerns over the use of amalgam restorations (fillings), relating to the mercury release in the body and the environmental impact following its disposal.
<INT> Resin composites have become an esthetic alternative to amalgam restorations and there has been a remarkable improvement of its mechanical properties to restore posterior teeth.
<INT> There is need to review new evidence comparing the effectiveness of both restorations.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 22 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 22 October 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 22 October 2013), and LILACs via BIREME Virtual Health Library (1980 to 22 October 2013).
<MaM> We applied no restrictions on language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.
<MaM> We contacted manufacturers of dental materials to obtain any unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized controlled trials comparing dental resin composites with dental amalgams in permanent posterior teeth.
<MaM> We excluded studies having a follow-up period of less than three years.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the 2205 retrieved references, we included seven trials (10 articles) in the systematic review.
<RES> Two trials were parallel group studies involving 1645 composite restorations and 1365 amalgam restorations (921 children) in the analysis.
<RES> The other five trials were split-mouth studies involving 1620 composite restorations and 570 amalgam restorations in an unclear number of children.
<RES> Due to major problems with the reporting of the data for the five split-mouth trials, the primary analysis is based on the two parallel group trials.
<RES> We judged all seven trials to be at high risk of bias and we analyzed 3265 composite restorations and 1935 amalgam restorations.
<RES> The parallel group trials indicated that resin restorations had a significantly higher risk of failure than amalgam restorations (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 2.35, P value < 0.001 (fixed-effect model) (low-quality evidence)) and increased risk of secondary caries (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.74, P value < 0.001 (low-quality evidence)) but no evidence of an increased risk of restoration fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.64, P value = 0.66 (moderate-quality evidence)).
<RES> The results from the split-mouth trials were consistent with those of the parallel group trials.
<RES> Adverse effects of dental restorations were reported in two trials.
<RES> The outcomes considered were neurobehavioral function, renal function, psychosocial function, and physical development.
<RES> The investigators found no difference in adverse effects between composite and amalgam restorations.
<RES> However, the results should be interpreted with caution as none of the outcomes were reported in more than one trial.

<H1> Peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b for chronic hepatitis C

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Peginterferon alpha-2a versus peginterferon alpha-2b for chronic hepatitis C

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Importance of the review or background on the condition
<ABS> Liver damage can lead to liver failure and other complications, including liver cancer.
<ABS> However, we still need to understand if clearance of virus from blood has any association with patient-relevant and clinically-relevant outcomes.
<ABS> The main findings of the review
<ABS> The review identified 17 randomised clinical trials.
<ABS> The trials reported on patient-relevant outcomes only occasionally.
<ABS> All trials had high risk of bias ie, a trial might systematically overestimate benefits or underestimate harms of the treatments).
<ABS> Both treatments were associated with a high risk of experiencing adverse events, which may lead to discontinuation of the treatment.
<ABS> Twelve trials reported on clearing the virus from blood six months after the end of treatment.
<ABS> A summary of the current evidence in this review suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a has higher chances of clearing the virus from the patient's blood than peginterferon alpha-2b (in 50% compared with 43%).
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We were unable to identify any evidence on the benefits of one peginterferon over the other on patient-important outcomes.
<ABS> Any limitations of the review
<ABS> There is lack of data regarding patient-important outcomes on this topic.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, it is not established which of the two licensed peginterferon products, peginterferon alpha-2a or peginterferon alpha-2b, is the most effective and has a better safety profile.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and LILACS until October 2013.
<MaM> We also searched conference abstracts, journals, and grey literature.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, other adverse events, and quality of life.
<MaM> The secondary outcome was sustained virological response in the blood serum.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently used a standardised data collection form.
<MaM> We meta-analysed data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models.
<MaM> For each outcome we calculated the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis.
<MaM> We used domains of the trials to assess the risk of systematic errors (bias) and trial sequential analyses to assess the risks of random errors (play of chance).
<MaM> Intervention effects on the outcomes were assessed according to GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 17 randomised clinical trials which compared peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin versus peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin in 5847 patients.
<RES> All trials had a high risk of bias.
<RES> Very few trials reported data on very few patients for the patient-relevant outcomes all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, serious adverse events, and quality of life.
<RES> Accordingly, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses on all-cause mortality, liver-related morbidity, and quality of life.
<RES> Twelve trials reported on adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment without clear evidence of a difference between the two peginterferons (197/2171 (9.1%) versus 311/3169 (9.9%); RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.22; I2 = 44%; low quality evidence).
<RES> A trial sequential analysis showed that we could exclude a relative risk reduction of 20% or more on this outcome.
<RES> Peginterferon alpha-2a significantly increased the number of patients who achieved a sustained virological response in the blood serum compared with peginterferon alpha-2b (1069/2099 (51%) versus 1327/3075 (43%); RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18; I2= 0%, 12 trials; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Trial sequential analyses supported this result.
<RES> Subgroup analyses based on risk of bias, viral genotype, and treatment history yielded similar results.
<RES> Trial sequential analyses supported the results in patients with genotypes 1 and 4, but not in patients with genotypes 2 and 3.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes and paucity of evidence on adverse events.
<CON> Moderate quality evidence suggests that peginterferon alpha-2a is associated with a higher sustained virological response in serum than with peginterferon alpha-2b.
<CON> This finding may be affected by the high risk of bias of the included studies .
<CON> The lack of evidence on patient-important outcomes and the paucity of evidence on adverse events means that we are unable to draw any conclusions about the effects of one peginterferon over the other.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preterm labour is indicated by regular contractions of the uterus and changes in the cervix (the opening of the womb) before 37 weeks of pregnancy.
<ABS> Preterm labour and birth may be associated with illness or death of the baby, and often place a substantial emotional burden on families.
<ABS> Preterm birth may also result in childhood disability.
<ABS> Even a short-term prolongation of pregnancy after the onset of threatened or actual preterm labour can allow the administration of corticosteroids to the mother to hasten fetal lung maturation and transfer of the mother to a centre with neonatal intensive care facilities.
<ABS> A range of drugs (tocolytic) are used to suppress labour.
<ABS> The oxytocin antagonist atosiban is one of these.
<ABS> Once the episode of threatened preterm labour settles, maintenance treatment with a tocolytic can then be used to try to prevent any reoccurrence.
<ABS> This has to be balanced against potential adverse outcomes such as intrauterine infection, fetal death, an increase in severe disability for survivors, and side-effects of the drugs.
<ABS> This review identified only one good quality multicentre controlled trial which showed that subcutaneously administered atosiban as maintenance therapy did not reduce the incidence of preterm birth or improve neonatal outcomes when compared with placebo treatment.
<ABS> The trial randomised 513 women in whom preterm labour (with intact membranes and limited cervical dilatation) ceased following intravenous treatment with atosiban.
<ABS> The mean gestation at enrolment was around 31 weeks and the proportion of multiple births was similar in the two groups.
<ABS> Atosiban infused at 6 mL/hr (30 µg/min) did not reduce preterm birth before 28, 32, or 37 weeks.
<ABS> Women on maintenance therapy were discharged home with a continuous subcutaneous infusion pump and daily nursing contact.
<ABS> There was an increase in injection site reaction for the atosiban group.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence of benefit to justify this intervention.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In some women, an episode of preterm labour settles and does not result in immediate preterm birth.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review includes one trial of 513 women.
<RES> No difference was shown in neonatal morbidity, or perinatal mortality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Future research should also focus on the pathophysiological pathways that precede preterm labour.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Over the last 10 years, the number of children found to have blood clots in their blood vessels, called veins, has become more common.
<ABS> As blood clots can either block these vessels and change their normal blood flow or shower pieces into other veins placed in important organs, serious health problems including death can occur.
<ABS> Venous clots are usually found in children with plastic tubes placed inside their blood vessels, called central lines, which are inserted to help or save the patient's life.
<ABS> However, these lines can also cause blood clots.
<ABS> We do not know if giving a medication to protect against blood clots, called an anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), would protect against the clots.
<ABS> Therefore, we looked at all the research in children with central lines who received, or not, LMWH and only found one study with a total of 186 participants.
<ABS> This study did not have enough participants to show if this medication protects children with central lines from getting blood clots.
<ABS> The study also did not show that children on LMWH, at the doses given, experience too much bleeding because of its use.
<ABS> The included study did not report any additional adverse events.
<ABS> There were two deaths within the study in the standard care arm, and neither were due to a blood clot.
<ABS> Future studies looking at the role of this medication (LMWH) and if it protects children with central venous lines from getting blood clots are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The most common thrombosis risk factor in neonates, infants and children is the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC).

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective of this review was to determine the effect of LMWH prophylaxis on reducing the incidence of CVC-related thrombosis in children.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched June 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 5) and clinical trial databases.
<MaM> The authors searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (July 2013).
<MaM> Bibliographies of identified articles were searched.
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We selected studies conducted in children aged 0 to 18 years.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified eligible studies, which were assessed for study quality including bias, and extracted unadjusted data where available.
<MaM> In the data analysis step, all outcomes were analysed as binary or dichotomous outcomes.
<MaM> The effects of interventions were summarised with risk ratios (RR) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One of 17 studies retrieved for full-text assessment for eligibility was included in the final analysis.
<RES> This study included a total of 186 participants and investigated the effect of LMWH to prevent CVC-related thrombosis compared to standard care.
<RES> The risk of bias of the study was assessed to be low, except for the unclear risk of selection bias (allocation concealment not reported) and detection bias since it was an open-label study.
<RES> Nonetheless, outcome adjudication was blinded.
<RES> However, overall the quality of the evidence was low due to the fact that the study was underpowered.
<RES> The CIs for the risk of CVC-related thrombosis (symptomatic and asymptomatic events) were compatible with benefits of either LMWH (reviparin) or the control (RR for symptomatic thrombosis 1.03, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.93; RR for asymptomatic thrombosis 1.17, 95% CI 0.45 to 3.08).
<RES> Similarly, only one patient in the standard care group suffered a major bleeding event, while minor bleeding was found in 53.3% of patients in the reviparin arm and in 44.7% of patients in the standard care arm (major bleeding RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.26; minor bleeding RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.58).
<RES> Lastly, there were two deaths within the study and neither were the result of a venous thrombotic event (VTE), occurring in the standard care arm.
<RES> No additional adverse effects were reported.
<RES> Other pre-specified outcomes for this review were not reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> A single study reported imprecise effects for the risk of CVC-related thrombosis in children on a CVC anticoagulant prophylaxis regimen.
<CON> Further prospective randomised studies are highly encouraged.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Heparin-bonded catheters for prolonging the patency of central venous catheters in children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Heparin-bonded catheters for prolonging the patency of central venous catheters in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Central venous catheters are used for prolonged intravenous therapy in the management of critically ill children, for parenteral nutrition, medication and monitoring.
<ABS> Having these catheters in place can cause blood clots in or around the end of the catheter as well as infection, either local or a blood stream infection.
<ABS> Anticoagulant drugs such as heparin can be given to prolong the usefulness of the catheter or the catheters can be coated with heparin (heparin-bonded catheters).
<ABS> Heparin can cause side effects such as bleeding, allergic reactions, induced thrombocytopenia (an abnormal drop in the number of platelets in the blood) and osteoporosis with long-term use.
<ABS> The review authors identified two good quality controlled trials that randomized 287 children aged one day to 16 years to either a heparin-bonded catheter or a standard catheter.
<ABS> There was a no difference between the two groups for risk of catheter-related thrombosis over the time the catheter was in.
<ABS> There was a trend towards a reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion in the first week after catheter placement, reported in one study only.
<ABS> The risks of catheter-related blood stream infections and bacterial colonization of the catheter were significantly reduced using the heparin-bonded catheter, with a longer time to develop infection (delayed in the heparin-bonded catheter group); however, it was reported in one study only and the strength of evidence was low.
<ABS> There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Central venous catheters (CVCs) are a mainstay in the management of critically ill children.
<INT> However, these catheters are associated with mechanical and infectious complications which reduce their life span.
<INT> Heparin bonding of catheters has shown promise in animal studies and in adults.
<INT> This is the first update of a review published in 2007.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary objective was to determine the effect of heparin-bonded CVCs on the duration of catheter patency in children.
<OBJ> Secondary objectives were to determine the effects of heparin-bonded catheters on catheter-related thrombosis, occlusion, blood stream infection and side effects.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The authors searched MEDLINE (1946 to week 3 August 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We assessed the methodological quality of the trials using the information provided in the studies and by contacting authors.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two eligible studies with a total of 287 participants; both had good methodological quality.
<RES> There was no difference in the duration of catheter patency between heparin-bonded and non-heparin bonded catheters (median duration seven days versus six days) reported in one study.
<RES> There was no difference in the risk of catheter-related thrombosis (two studies, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.68; I2 = 80%; RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.06).
<RES> Data from one study revealed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of catheter occlusion (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.07; RD -0.08, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.02; NNT 13, 95% CI 8 to 50), catheter-related blood stream infections (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.41; RD -0.17, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.10; NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 10) and catheter colonization (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; RD -0.11, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.04; NNT 9, 95% CI 5 to 25) in the heparin-bonded catheter group.
<RES> The second study did not report on these outcomes.
<RES> There was no significant difference in risk of thrombocytopenia after catheter placement (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.39; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.07).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Two eligible studies on the use of heparin-bonded catheters versus placebo in children were identified.
<CON> Meta-analysis of the two studies revealed no reduction in catheter-related thrombosis with heparin-bonded catheters.
<CON> One study reported a reduction in catheter-related blood stream infection and colonization following the use of heparin-bonded catheters.
<CON> The strength of evidence is low and further well-designed multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The liver produces bile which has many functions, including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat.
<ABS> The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel.
<ABS> Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones.
<ABS> Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult western population.
<ABS> Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic in a year.
<ABS> The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolourisation of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ which secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis).
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).
<ABS> Drain is a tube that is left inside the tummy to allow drainage of fluids to outside the tummy.
<ABS> Some surgeons have routinely drained after laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of the fear of collection of bile or blood requiring re-operation.
<ABS> As the name indicates, the drain may drain out these collections to the exterior, thereby avoiding open surgery.
<ABS> However, routine use of drains may necessitate the patient to stay overnight or require drain removal after discharge both of which increase resource utilisation in this era of day surgery (where patients are admitted and discharged on the same day of surgery).
<ABS> The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to use routine drainage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> A systematic search of medical literature was performed in order to identify studies which provided information on the above question.
<ABS> The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well.
<ABS> Two authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.
<ABS> A total of 1831 participants received drain (915 patients) versus 'no drain' (916 patients) in 12 trials included in this review.
<ABS> The decision of whether the patients received drain or not was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin.
<ABS> The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information.
<ABS> The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information.
<ABS> There was no significant or clinically important differences in the short-term mortality, serious complications, quality of life, length of hospital stay, operating time, return to normal activity, or return to work in the trials that reported these outcomes.
<ABS> The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than in the 'no drain' group in one trial of high risk of bias involving 68 participants.
<ABS> Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the main method of treatment of symptomatic gallstones.
<INT> Drains are used after laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent abdominal collections.
<INT> However, drain use may increase infective complications and delay discharge.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures defined by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 1831 participants were randomised to drain (915 participants) versus 'no drain' (916 participants) in 12 trials included in this review.
<RES> Only two trials including 199 participants were of low risk of bias.
<RES> Nine trials included patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy exclusively.
<RES> One trial included patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis exclusively.
<RES> One trial included patients undergoing elective and emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and one trial did not provide this information.
<RES> The average age of participants in the trials ranged between 48 years and 63 years in the 10 trials that provided this information.
<RES> The proportion of females ranged between 55.0% and 79.0% in the 11 trials that provided this information.
<RES> There was no significant difference between the drain group (1/840) (adjusted proportion: 0.1%) and the 'no drain' group (2/841) (0.2%) (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.37) in short-term mortality in the ten trials with 1681 participants reporting on this outcome.
<RES> There was no significant difference between the drain group (7/567) (adjusted proportion: 1.1%) and the 'no drain' group (3/576) (0.5%) in the proportion of patients who developed serious adverse events in the seven trials with 1143 participants reporting on this outcome (RR 2.12; 95% CI 0.67 to 7.40) or in the number of serious adverse events in each group reported by eight trials with 1286 participants; drain group (12/646) (adjusted rate: 1.5 events per 100 participants) versus 'no drain' group (6/640) (0.9 events per 100 participants); rate ratio 1.60; 95% CI 0.66 to 3.87).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the quality of life between the two groups (one trial; 93 participants; SMD 0.22; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.63).
<RES> The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy seemed significantly lower in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (one trial; 68 participants; drain group (0/33) (adjusted proportion: 0.2%) versus 'no drain' group (11/35) (31.4%); RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.75).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (five trials; 449 participants; MD 0.22 days; 95% CI -0.06 days to 0.51 days).
<RES> The operating time was significantly longer in the drain group than the 'no drain' group (seven trials; 775 participants; MD 5.00 minutes; 95% CI 2.69 minutes to 7.30 minutes).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the return to normal activity and return to work between the groups in one trial involving 100 participants.
<RES> This trial did not provide any information from which the standard deviation could be imputed and so the confidence intervals could not be calculated for these outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently no evidence to support the routine use of drain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> Further well designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hypercalciuria, an inherited metabolic condition, is the presence of excessive calcium in the urine.
<ABS> The cause is often unknown (idiopathic), and may occur in people who are otherwise well.
<ABS> Although people with the condition have normal levels of calcium in their blood, calcium is lost through the urine.
<ABS> Adults with hypercalciuria are prone to developing kidney stones and losing calcium from their bones.
<ABS> In children, hypercalciuria can cause blood in the urine (haematuria), frequency-dysuria syndrome (frequent painful or difficult urination), urinary tract infections, abdominal and back pain.
<ABS> It has been suggested that altering the diets of people with hypercalciuria could help to prevent complications of the condition.
<ABS> We therefore aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of dietary interventions that had been investigated in clinical studies.
<ABS> We included five studies in our review, one of which compared a low calcium diet with a diet that included normal levels of calcium, low protein, low salt over five years.
<ABS> This study found that diets unrestricted for calcium intake significantly decreased numbers of new kidney stones.
<ABS> Other dietary interventions, such as unprocessed wheat bran, did not show any evidence of beneficial effects.
<ABS> We did not find any studies in children, and none investigating specific dietary recommendations for those who had hypercalciuria without symptoms.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Idiopathic hypercalciuria is an inherited metabolic abnormality that is characterised by excessive amounts of calcium excreted in the urine by people whose calcium serum levels are normal.
<INT> Morbidity associated with idiopathic hypercalciuria is chiefly related to kidney stone disease and bone demineralisation leading to osteopenia and osteoporosis.
<INT> Idiopathic hypercalciuria contributes to kidney stone disease at all life stages; people with the condition are prone to developing oxalate and calcium phosphate kidney stones.
<INT> In some cases, crystallised calcium can be deposited in the renal interstitium, causing increased calcium levels in the kidneys.
<INT> In children, idiopathic hypercalciuria can cause a range of comorbidities including recurrent macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, frequency dysuria syndrome, urinary tract infections and abdominal and lumbar pain.
<INT> Various dietary interventions have been described that aim to decrease urinary calcium levels or urinary crystallisation.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Studies were assessed for inclusion and data extracted using a standardised data extraction form.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five studies (379 adult participants) that investigated a range of interventions.
<RES> Lack of similarity among interventions investigated meant that data could not be pooled.
<RES> Overall, study methodology was not adequately reported in any of the included studies.
<RES> There was a high risk of bias associated with blinding (although it seems unlikely that outcomes measures were unduly influenced by lack of intervention blinding), random sequence generation and allocation methodologies were unclear in most studies, but selective reporting bias was assessed as low.
<RES> One study (120 participants) compared a low calcium diet with a normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet for five years.
<RES> There was a significant decrease in numbers of new stone recurrences in those treated with the normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98).
<RES> This diet also led to a significant decrease in oxaluria (MD 78.00 µmol/d, 95% CI 26.48 to 129.52) and the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation index (MD 1.20 95% CI 0.21 to 2.19).
<RES> One study (210 participants) compared a low salt, normal calcium diet with a broad diet for three months.
<RES> The low salt, normal calcium diet decreased urinary calcium (MD -45.00 mg/d, 95% CI -74.83 to -15.17) and oxalate excretion (MD -4.00 mg/d, 95% CI -6.44 to -1.56).
<RES> A small study (17 participants) compared the effect of dietary fibre as part of a low calcium, low oxalate diet over three weeks, and found that although calciuria levels decreased, oxaluria increased.
<RES> Phyllanthus niruri plant substrate intake was investigated in a small subgroup with hypercalciuria (20 participants); there was no significant effect on calciuria levels occurred after three months of treatment.
<RES> A small cross-over study (12 participants) evaluating the changes in urinary supersaturation indices among patients who consumed calcium-fortified orange juice or milk for one month found no benefits for participants.
<RES> None of the studies reported any significant adverse effects associated with the interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Adherence to a low salt, normal calcium level diet for some months can reduce calciuria and oxaluria.
<CON> However, the other dietary interventions examined did not demonstrate evidence of significant beneficial effects.
<CON> No studies were found investigating the effect of dietary recommendations on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria.

<H1> Steroidal contraceptives: effect on bone fractures in women

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Hormonal contraceptives and bone health in women

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hormonal contraceptives have been related to bone changes in women.
<ABS> Whether such changes lead to more bone fractures later in life is not clear.
<ABS> However, bone health is a major public health concern.
<ABS> Bone density declines with age, and the change increases the risk of fracture.
<ABS> Due to concern about bone health, health care providers may not suggest hormonal contraceptives and women may not want to use them.
<ABS> Through April 2014, we did computer searches for studies of birth control methods containing hormones and risk of fractures.
<ABS> Outcomes could also be bone mineral density or markers of bone changes.
<ABS> Birth control pills included types with both estrogen and progestin.
<ABS> Also included were implants and injectables with only progestin.
<ABS> We wrote to researchers to find other trials.
<ABS> We included randomized trials in any language that had at least three treatment cycles.
<ABS> The studies had to compare two types of birth control or one type of birth control or a supplement with a placebo or 'dummy' method.
<ABS> We found 19 trials.
<ABS> Fifteen studies compared one birth control method with another hormone method.
<ABS> Two trials used a placebo or 'dummy.'
<ABS> One compared a hormone method to a method without hormones.
<ABS> None had fractures as an outcome and most looked at bone density.
<ABS> Birth control methods with both estrogen and progestin did not appear to affect bone health.
<ABS> However, 'depo,' which is injected and has only progestin, was related to lower bone density.
<ABS> The two depo trials with placebos showed increased bone density when some estrogen was given to women on depo.
<ABS> Bone density decreased in women who got a 'dummy' with the depo.
<ABS> Whether this decrease is important to the woman's health is not known.
<ABS> For implants, an etonogestrel implant with one rod showed a greater decrease in bone density than a two-rod levonorgestrel implant.
<ABS> However, other implants studied did not show the same pattern.
<ABS> The studies had data of moderate quality.
<ABS> Whether hormonal contraceptives affect fracture risk cannot be judged from current information.
<ABS> These contraceptive methods work well for birth control.
<ABS> Health-care providers and women should think about the costs and benefits.
<ABS> For instance, injectable use can occur without a partner's knowledge, and is simpler than taking pills every day.
<ABS> Also, progestin-only methods are suggested for some women with health problems who should avoid estrogen.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Steroidal contraceptive use has been associated with changes in bone mineral density in women.
<INT> Whether such changes increase the risk of fractures later in life is not clear.
<INT> Osteoporosis is a major public health concern.
<INT> Age-related decline in bone mass increases the risk of fracture, especially of the spine, hip, and wrist.
<INT> Concern about bone health influences the recommendation and use of these effective contraceptives globally.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Through April 2014, we searched for studies of fracture or bone health and hormonal contraceptives in MEDLINE, POPLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and LILACS, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP.
<MaM> We examined reference lists of relevant articles for other trials.
<MaM> For the initial review, we wrote to investigators to find additional trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Eligible interventions included comparisons of a hormonal contraceptive with a placebo or with another hormonal contraceptive that differed in terms of drug, dosage, or regimen.
<MaM> They also included providing a supplement to one group.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We assessed all titles and abstracts identified through the literature searches.
<MaM> Mean differences were computed using the inverse variance approach.
<MaM> For dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) was calculated.
<MaM> Both included the 95% confidence interval (CI) and used a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> Due to differing interventions, no trials could be combined for meta-analysis.
<MaM> We applied principles from GRADE to assess the evidence quality and address confidence in the effect estimates.
<MaM> In addition, a sensitivity analysis included trials that provided sufficient data for this review and evidence of at least moderate quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found 19 RCTs that met our eligibility criteria.
<RES> Eleven trials compared different combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or regimens of COCs; five examined an injectable versus another injectable, implant, or IUD; two studied implants, and one compared the transdermal patch versus the vaginal ring.
<RES> No trial had fracture as an outcome.
<RES> BMD was measured in 17 studies and 12 trials assessed biochemical markers of bone turnover.
<RES> Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) was associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD).
<RES> The placebo-controlled trials showed BMD increases for DMPA plus estrogen supplement and decreases for DMPA plus placebo supplement.
<RES> COCs did not appear to negatively affect BMD, and some formulations had more positive effects than others.
<RES> However, no COC trial was placebo-controlled.
<RES> Where studies showed differences between groups in bone turnover markers, the results were generally consistent with those for BMD.
<RES> For implants, the single-rod etonogestrel group showed a greater BMD decrease versus the two-rod levonorgestrel group but results were not consistent across all implant comparisons.
<RES> The sensitivity analysis included 11 trials providing evidence of moderate or high quality.
<RES> Four trials involving DMPA showed some positive effects of an estrogen supplement on BMD, a negative effect of DMPA-subcutaneous on lumbar spine BMD, and a negative effect of DMPA on a bone formation marker.
<RES> Of the three COC trials, one had a BMD decrease for the group with gestodene plus EE 15 μg.
<RES> Another indicated less bone resorption in the group with gestodene plus EE 30 μg versus EE 20 μg.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information.
<CON> The evidence quality was considered moderate overall, largely due to the trials of DMPA, implants, and the patch versus ring.
<CON> The COC evidence varied in quality but was low overall.
<CON> Many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses.
<CON> Health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives.
<CON> For example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen.
<CON> Progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Patients with severe lung disease, such as acute respiratory failure, may require invasive mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy until their underlying disease is either treated or stabilized.
<ABS> Both early suspension of or delay in withdrawing mechanical ventilation can however lead to complications that may delay the weaning of patients from mechanical ventilation and prolong their length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital.
<ABS> Previous studies and systematic reviews suggest that a weaning protocol should be implemented in order to make daily assessments of patients who may be ready for weaning from mechanical ventilation.
<ABS> The ability to breathe spontaneously can be assessed with a spontaneous breathing trial using a T-tube (T-piece) or by reducing the applied airway pressure to provide low levels of pressure support (PS) (5 to 10 cm H2O).
<ABS> If over this period ventilatory support does not need to be reintroduced, this is taken to indicate successful weaning.
<ABS> For this Cochrane systematic review we searched the medical literature databases until June 2012 and included nine studies with 1208 adult patients who had been on invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours.
<ABS> The trials compared pressure support (PS) and the use of a T-tube (622 patients randomized to PS and 586 randomized to a T-tube).
<ABS> There was no clear evidence to confirm that PS was superior to a T-tube with regard to the success of weaning, need for reintubation, ICU mortality, and other factors including long-term weaning unit (LWU) length of stay, pneumonia and a rapid shallow breathing index.
<ABS> Among patients who received PS, a greater number of patients had a successful spontaneous breathing trial and the airway tube was removed.
<ABS> For respiratory rate and tidal volume outcomes PS was superior to using a T-tube in two trials.
<ABS> We reran the search in December 2013.
<ABS> We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Mechanical ventilation is important in caring for patients with critical illness.
<INT> Clinical complications, increased mortality, and high costs of health care are associated with prolonged ventilatory support or premature discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
<INT> Weaning refers to the process of gradually or abruptly withdrawing mechanical ventilation.
<INT> The weaning process begins after partial or complete resolution of the underlying pathophysiology precipitating respiratory failure and ends with weaning success (successful extubation in intubated patients or permanent withdrawal of ventilatory support in tracheostomized patients).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We reran the search in December 2013.
<MaM> We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies.
<MaM> Meta-analyses using the random-effects model were conducted for nine outcomes.
<MaM> Relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) were used to estimate the treatment effect, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies placed patients in two categories of weaning.
<RES> Pressure support ventilation (PSV) and a T-tube were used directly as SBTs in four studies (844 patients, 69.9% of the sample).
<RES> In 186 patients (15.4%) both interventions were used along with gradual weaning from mechanical ventilation; the PS was gradually decreased, twice a day, until it was minimal and periods with a T-tube were gradually increased to two and eight hours for patients with difficult and prolonged weaning.
<RES> PS was then compared to the trial with the T-tube (TT).
<RES> We identified 33 different reported outcomes in the included studies; we took 14 of them into consideration and performed meta-analyses on nine.
<RES> With regard to the sequence of allocation generation, allocation concealment, selective reporting and attrition bias, no study presented a high risk of bias.
<RES> We found no clear evidence of a difference between PS and TT for weaning success (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.17, 9 studies, low quality of evidence), intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.23, 5 studies, low quality of evidence), reintubation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26, 7 studies, low quality evidence), ICU and long-term weaning unit (LWU) length of stay (MD -7.08 days, 95% CI -16.26 to 2.1, 2 studies, low quality of evidence) and pneumonia (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.85, 2 studies, low quality of evidence).
<RES> PS was significantly superior to the TT for successful SBTs (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, 4 studies, moderate quality of evidence).
<RES> Four studies reported on weaning duration, however we were unable to combined the study data because of differences in how the studies presented their data.
<RES> One study was at high risk of other bias and four studies were at high risk for detection bias.
<RES> Three studies reported that the weaning duration was shorter with PS, and in one study the duration was shorter in patients with a TT.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The effects on weaning success, ICU mortality, reintubation, ICU and LWU length of stay, and pneumonia were imprecise.
<CON> However, PSV was more effective than a T-tube for successful spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) among patients with simple weaning.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in upper abdominal surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications after upper abdominal surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Previous studies have suggested that between 17% and 88% of people having surgery on the upper abdomen will suffer complications that affect their lungs after the operation (postoperative pulmonary complications).
<ABS> Incentive spirometers are mechanical devices developed to help people take long, deep, and slow breaths to increase lung inflation.
<ABS> Objective
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of incentive spirometry (IS), compared to no intervention or other therapy, to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications (for example, pneumonia, fever, death) in people following upper abdominal surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included adults (aged 18 years and above) admitted for any type of upper abdominal surgery.
<ABS> The evidence is current to August 2013.
<ABS> We found 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants.
<ABS> The maximum period of time that a patient was followed by the doctor was seven days postoperatively.
<ABS> The quality of the included studies was uncertain because of poor reporting in the published articles.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The following results were examined in this review: clinical complications, respiratory failure (that is, inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system), and pulmonary complications.
<ABS> The results from participants receiving IS were the same as for those receiving either no treatment, deep breathing exercises (DBE) or physiotherapy in the meta-analyses for clinical complications, respiratory failure, and pulmonary complications.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Because of poorly conducted studies (results not similar across studies; some issues with study design and; not enough data collected and organized) we ranked the overall quality of the evidence reported in this review as low.
<ABS> Conclusion and future research
<ABS> There is low quality evidence showing a lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery.
<ABS> This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3.
<INT> Upper abdominal surgical procedures are associated with a high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.
<INT> The risk and severity of postoperative pulmonary complications can be reduced by the judicious use of therapeutic manoeuvres that increase lung volume.
<INT> Our objective was to assess the effect of incentive spirometry compared to no therapy or physiotherapy, including coughing and deep breathing, on all-cause postoperative pulmonary complications and mortality in adult patients admitted to hospital for upper abdominal surgery.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS (from inception to August 2013).
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.
<MaM> The date of the most recent search was 12 August 2013.
<MaM> The original search was performed in June 2006.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 studies with a total of 1834 participants in this updated review.
<RES> The methodological quality of the included studies was difficult to assess as it was poorly reported, so the predominant classification of bias was 'unclear'; the studies did not report on compliance with the prescribed therapy.
<RES> We were able to include data from only 1160 patients in the meta-analysis.
<RES> Four trials (152 patients) compared the effects of IS with no respiratory treatment.
<RES> We found no statistically significant difference between the participants receiving IS and those who had no respiratory treatment for clinical complications (relative risk (RR) 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.18).
<RES> Two trials (194 patients) IS compared incentive spirometry with deep breathing exercises (DBE).
<RES> We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS and those receiving DBE in the meta-analysis for respiratory failure (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.04 to 10.50).
<RES> Two trials (946 patients) compared IS with other chest physiotherapy.
<RES> We found no statistically significant differences between the participants receiving IS compared to those receiving physiotherapy in the risk of developing a pulmonary condition or the type of complication.
<RES> There was no evidence that IS is effective in the prevention of pulmonary complications.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is low quality evidence regarding the lack of effectiveness of incentive spirometry for prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients after upper abdominal surgery.
<CON> This review underlines the urgent need to conduct well-designed trials in this field.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> There are many causes of acute cough, one of which is pneumonia.
<ABS> Cough is burdensome and impairs quality of life.
<ABS> Over-the-counter (OTC) medications are commonly purchased and used by patients, and are recommended by healthcare staff as additional medications in the treatment of pneumonia.
<ABS> There are many classes of OTC medications for cough, such as mucolytics (medications that can reduce the thickness of mucus) and antitussives (medications that suppress cough).
<ABS> This review aims to balance the possible benefits of these agents with their potential risks.
<ABS> In this review we found four studies with a total of 224 participants that were suitable for inclusion; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults.
<ABS> However, data could only be obtained from two studies; both studies used mucolytics (ambroxol and bromhexine) in conjunction with antibiotics.
<ABS> Combining these two studies, the rate of cure or improvement in cough of people who received mucolytics was similar to those who did not.
<ABS> However, in the secondary analysis, children who received a mucolytic were more likely to be cured of cough (the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 was 5 for children and 4 for adults).
<ABS> There were no reported increased adverse events in the treatment group.
<ABS> The range of possible adverse events associated with OTC medications for cough is wide and includes minimal adverse events (such as with the use of honey) to serious adverse events, such as altered heart rate patterns, drowsiness and death in young children.
<ABS> The studies included in this review did not report any detectable increase in adverse events.
<ABS> There were no obvious biases in the studies.
<ABS> This review has substantial limitations due to the unavailability of data from studies.
<ABS> Also there are no studies of other common OTC medications used for cough, such as antihistamines and antitussives.
<ABS> Thus, there is insufficient evidence to draw any definitive conclusions on the role of OTC medications taken as an additional treatment for cough associated with acute pneumonia.
<ABS> Mucolytics may be beneficial but the lack of consistent evidence precludes recommending the routine use of mucolytics as an addition in the treatment of troublesome cough associated with pneumonia in children or adults.
<ABS> The evidence is current to January 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cough is often distressing for patients with pneumonia.
<INT> Accordingly they often use over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications (mucolytics or cough suppressants).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We independently selected trials for inclusion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There are no new trials to include in this review update.
<RES> Previously, four studies with a total of 224 participants were included; one was performed exclusively in children and three in adolescents or adults.
<RES> One using an antitussive had no extractable pneumonia-specific data.
<RES> Three different mucolytics (bromhexine, ambroxol, neltenexine) were used in the remaining studies, of which only two had extractable data.
<RES> They demonstrated no significant difference for the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' for mucolytics.
<RES> A secondary outcome of 'not cured' was reduced (odds ratio (OR) for children 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.77; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) at day 10 = 5 (95% CI 3 to 16) and OR 0.32 for adults (95% CI 0.13 to 0.75); NNTB at day 10 = 5 (95% CI 3 to 19)).
<RES> In a post hoc analysis combining data for children and adults, again there was no difference in the primary outcome of 'not cured or not improved' (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.80) although mucolytics reduced the secondary outcome 'not cured' (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 8).
<RES> The risk of bias was low or unclear.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the effect of tamponade agents used in surgery involving pars plana vitrectomy in participants with retinal detachment (RD) associated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> RD, a physical separation of the retina from the RPE, remains an important cause of visual loss.
<ABS> The macula is the centermost part of the retina and is responsible for central vision and perception of fine details.
<ABS> RD may or may not involve the macula, but patients with macular detachment typically have more severe visual loss than patients without macular detachment.
<ABS> RD is generally treated with surgery, but surgery is not always successful.
<ABS> In some patients surgery is initially successful but RD may recur months or years later.
<ABS> Most recurrent RDs, and some primary RDs, are associated with varying degrees of PVR, or the growth of fibrous membranes (similar to scar tissue) along the surface of the retina.
<ABS> The only proven therapy for RD with PVR is further surgery; where the membranes must be physically removed from the surface of the retina.
<ABS> In addition, injection of a material to hold the newly attached retina in position, called a tamponade agent, is performed to reduce the rate of fluid flow through open retinal tears, which would cause recurrent RD.
<ABS> The major tamponade agents that are available today are various gases and silicone oils.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 516 participants that compared tamponade agents.
<ABS> All participants underwent surgery to treat RD associated with PVR.
<ABS> The Silicone Study compared the use of silicone oil to either sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas in two RCTs.
<ABS> The Heavy Silicone Oil Study compared the use of heavy silicone oil to standard silicone oil in participants with RD involving the lower parts of the retina.
<ABS> The evidence was current to June 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When silicone oil was compared to SF6 gas, eyes randomized to receive silicone oil more often achieved a visual acuity of 5/200 or better at one year, and more often achieved macular attachment at one year but with no difference at two years.
<ABS> When silicone oil was compared with C3F8 gas, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to visual acuity or macular attachment at one year.
<ABS> When heavy silicone oil was compared to standard silicone oil, there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to retinal re-attachment or visual acuity at one year.
<ABS> Heavy silicone oil did not demonstrate any significant benefit over standard silicone oil.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of these studies was moderately satisfactory.
<ABS> Although all trials employed proper randomization methods for participants, the masking of participants was unclear in all of the three RCTs, and masking of outcome assessors was not performed in two RCTs.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Retinal detachment (RD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) often requires surgery to restore normal anatomy and to stabilize or improve vision.
<INT> Either way, a tamponade agent (gas or silicone oil) is needed during surgery to reduce the rate of postoperative recurrent RD.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 26 June 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened the search results independently.
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review included 516 participants from three RCTs.
<RES> One study was conducted in the USA and consisted of two trials: the first trial randomized 151 adults to receive either silicone oil or sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponades; and the second trial randomized 271 adults to receive either silicone oil or perfluropropane (C3F8) gas tamponades.
<RES> The third trial was a multi-center international trial and randomized 94 participants (age range not specified) to receive heavy silicone oil (a mixture of perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8) and silicone oil) versus standard silicone oil (either 1000 centistokes or 5000 centistokes, per the surgeon's preference).
<RES> In participants with RD associated with PVR, outcomes after pars plana vitrectomy and infusion of either silicone oil, perfluropropane gas, or sulfur hexafluoride gas appeared comparable for a broad variety of cases.
<RES> There were no significant differences between silicone oil and perfluoropropane gas in terms of the proportion of participants achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity (risk ratio (RR) 0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.31) or achieving macular attachment (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15) at a minimum of one year.
<RES> Although sulfur hexafluoride gas was reported to be associated with significantly worse anatomic and visual outcomes than was silicone oil at one year (quantitative data not reported), there were no significant differences between silicone oil and sulfur hexafluoride gas in terms of achieving at least 5/200 visual acuity at two years (RR 1.57; 95% CI 0.93 to 2.66).
<RES> For macular attachment, participants treated with silicone oil received significantly more favourable outcomes than did participants who received sulfur hexafluoride at both one year (quantitative data not reported) and two years (RR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.86).
<RES> The first two trials did not perform any sample size calculation or power detection.
<RES> In the third trial, which had a power of 80% to detect differences, heavy silicone oil was not shown to be superior to standard silicone oil.
<RES> There were no significant differences between standard silicone oil and heavy silicone oil in the change in visual acuity at one year using adjusted mean logMAR visual acuity (mean difference -0.03 logMAR; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.29).
<RES> Adverse events were not reported for the first two trials.
<RES> For the third trial, only the total number of adverse events was reported, and adverse events for each group were not specified.
<RES> Of the 94 participants, four died, 26 had recurrent retinal detachment, 22 developed glaucoma, four developed a cataract, and two had capsular fibrosis.
<RES> All three trials employed adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment.
<RES> None of the trials employed masking of participants and surgeons, and only the third trial masked outcome assessors.
<RES> The first trial had a large portion of participants excluded from the final analyses, while the other two trials were at low risk of attrition bias.
<RES> All trials appear to be free of reporting bias.
<RES> The first two trials were funded by the National Eye Institute, and the third trial was funded by the German Research Foundation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The use of either perfluropropane or standard silicone oil appears reasonable for most patients with RD associated with PVR.
<CON> Because there do not appear to be any major differences in outcomes between the two agents, the choice of a tamponade agent should be individualized for each patient.
<CON> Heavy silicone oil, which is not available for routine clinical use in the USA, has not demonstrated evidence of superiority over standard silicone oil.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Interventions for Mooren's ulcer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Interventions for Mooren's ulcer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Mooren's ulcer is inflammation that occurs at the edge of the cornea (clear part of the front of the eye).
<ABS> Its cause is unknown.
<ABS> It is very painful and can or will lead to loss of vision if untreated.
<ABS> It occurs worldwide and affects all age groups.
<ABS> It is diagnosed by excluding other causes of ulcerations at the edge of the cornea such as chronic inflammation of the joints due to rheumatoid arthritis.
<ABS> Mooren's ulcer can be treated both medically and surgically.
<ABS> Medical treatment includes the use of drugs such as steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.
<ABS> Surgical methods include resection of the conjunctiva (the thin clear tissue that covers the surface of the eye) from the cornea, removal of dead cornea tissue and cornea transplant.
<ABS> We set out to determine the best available intervention for the treatment of Mooren’s ulcer by looking for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one form of treatment to another; and treatment versus no treatment.
<ABS> The electronic database searches did not find any RCTs on the treatment of Mooren’s ulcer.
<ABS> This review recommends the need for well conducted RCTs for both medical and surgical interventions for Mooren’s ulcer.
<ABS> These trials should look at outcomes such as number of participants that healed against those that did not, what percentage of area healed and the speed at which healing took place.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Mooren's ulcer is a chronic, painful peripheral ulcer of the cornea.
<INT> Its cause is unknown but it can or will lead to loss of vision if untreated.
<INT> Severe pain is common in patients with Mooren's ulcer and the eye(s) may be intensely reddened, inflamed and photophobic, with tearing.
<INT> The disease is rare in the northern hemisphere but more common in southern and central Africa, China and the Indian subcontinent.
<INT> There are a number of treatments used such as anti-inflammatory drugs (steroidal and non-steroidal), cytotoxic drugs (topical and systemic), conjunctivectomy and cornea debridement (superficial keratectomy).
<INT> There is no evidence to show which is the most effective amongst these treatment modalities.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to June 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to June 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 4 June 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or discuss any prospective non-RCTs in the absence of any RCTs.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence in the form of RCTs to assess the treatment effect for the various interventions for Mooren's ulcer.
<CON> High quality RCTs that compare medical or surgical interventions across different demographics are needed.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Tumours characterised by the presence of the HER2 protein are found in about one in five women with metastatic breast cancer.
<ABS> These tend to be more aggressive and the prognosis and choice of treatment are affected.
<ABS> Trastuzumab (Herceptin®) is a targeted biological drug (a monoclonal antibody) that attaches to the HER2 protein, blocking the growth of malignant cells.
<ABS> We included seven trials with 1497 women who had HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in this review.
<ABS> They were assigned by chance to receive trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy (taxane, anthracycline or capecitabine in four studies), hormonal therapy (aromatase inhibitors including letrozole or anastrozole in two studies) or targeted therapy (lapatinib in one study).
<ABS> Women treated with trastuzumab were followed up until disease progression in five studies and beyond disease progression in two studies.
<ABS> The length of trastuzumab administration varied between 8.7 and 30 months, and follow-up averaged two years after starting trastuzumab.
<ABS> All studies found that trastuzumab extends time to disease progression, with gains varying between two and 11 months, and in five studies it extended time to death by between five and eight months.
<ABS> However, some patients develop severe heart toxicity (congestive heart failure) during treatment.
<ABS> While trastuzumab reduces breast cancer mortality by one-fifth, the risk of heart toxicity is between three and four times more likely.
<ABS> If 1000 women were given standard therapy alone (with no trastuzumab) about 300 would survive and 10 would have heart toxicities.
<ABS> With the addition of trastuzumab to this treatment, an additional 73 would have their lives prolonged, and an additional 25 would have severe heart toxicity.
<ABS> Omitting the anthracycline-trastuzumab arms (which would not be regarded as standard of care) 21 patients would have severe heart toxicity (11 more than the chemotherapy alone group).
<ABS> These heart toxicities are often reversible if the treatment is stopped once heart disease is discovered.
<ABS> Women with advanced disease might choose to accept this risk.
<ABS> On balance, this review shows that with trastuzumab the time to disease progression and survival benefits outweigh the risk of heart harm.
<ABS> Trastuzumab does not increase the risk of haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia; however, it seems to raise the risk of neutropenia.
<ABS> There were insufficient data on the impact of trastuzumab on quality of life, treatment-related deaths and brain metastases to reach a conclusion for these outcomes.
<ABS> We rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate, with the main weaknesses being the fact that all studies included were open-label (not blinded), which may have affected the outcome assessments for time to disease progression and toxicities, and that two studies have not published their results for mortality.
<ABS> Furthermore, the recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at disease progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab on mortality.
<ABS> The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond disease progression is limited.
<ABS> It is important to highlight that, although trastuzumab is used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer, the women enrolled in these metastatic trials were not previously treated with trastuzumab.
<ABS> The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is still an open issue, although it is likely that it is offered to the majority of them.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Patients with breast cancer are classified as having cells that over-express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2-positive) or not (HER2-negative).
<INT> Typically, patients with HER2-positive disease have a worse prognosis.
<INT> Trastuzumab is a selective treatment that targets the HER2 pathway.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We collected data from published trials.
<MaM> We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes.
<MaM> Subgroup analyses included type of regimen (taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing, aromatase inhibitor-containing or other) and treatment line (first-line, beyond progression).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The review found seven trials, involving 1497 patients, which met the criteria to be included.
<RES> The trials were generally of moderate methodological quality; two studies have not published their results on overall survival so the presence of selective outcome reporting bias cannot be ruled out.
<RES> None of the studies used blinding to treatment allocation, though this is unlikely to have biased the results for overall survival.
<RES> Studies varied in terms of co-administered regimen and in terms of treatment line.
<RES> In four studies, trastuzumab was administered with a chemotherapy, such as a taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing or capecitabine-containing regimen.
<RES> Two studies considered postmenopausal women and administered trastuzumab with hormone-blocking medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor.
<RES> One study administered trastuzumab in addition to lapatinib.
<RES> Five studies out of seven included women treated with trastuzumab administered until progression as first-line treatment and two studies considered trastuzumab beyond progression.
<RES> The combined HRs for overall survival and progression-free survival favoured the trastuzumab-containing regimens (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.94, P = 0.004; and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70, P < 0.00001, respectively; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Trastuzumab increased the risk of congestive heart failure (RR 3.49, 90% CI 1.88 to 6.47, P = 0.0009; moderate-quality evidence) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline (RR 2.65, 90% CI 1.48 to 4.74, P = 0.006).
<RES> For haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia, there was no clear evidence that risks differed between groups, while trastuzumab seemed to raise the risk of neutropenia.
<RES> The overall survival improvement was maintained when considering patients treated as first-line or patients receiving taxane-based regimens.
<RES> The progression-free survival improvement was maintained when considering patients receiving taxane-based regimens, and patients treated as first-line or subsequent lines.
<RES> Few data were collected on central nervous system progression.
<RES> Similarly, few studies reported on quality of life and treatment-related deaths.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Trastuzumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival in HER2-positive women with metastatic breast cancer, but it also increased the risk of cardiac toxicities, such as congestive heart failure and LVEF decline.
<CON> The available subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of studies.
<CON> Studies that administered trastuzumab as first-line treatment, or along with a taxane-based regimen, improved mortality outcomes.
<CON> The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond progression is limited.
<CON> The recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab.
<CON> Trastuzumab is generally used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in clinical practice, while women enrolled in most of the trials in the metastatic setting were naive to trastuzumab.
<CON> The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is therefore still an open issue, although it is likely that the majority are being offered it again.


<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Demographic data in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand suggest a rapid growth in the number of persons over the age of 65 years as the baby boomer generation passes retirement age.
<INT> As older adults make up an increasing proportion of the population, they are an important consideration when designing future evidence-based traffic safety policies, particularly those that lead to restrictions or cessation of driving.
<INT> Research has shown that cessation of driving among older drivers can lead to negative emotional consequences such as depression and loss of independence.
<INT> Older adults who continue to drive tend to do so less frequently than other demographic groups and are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash, possibly due to what is termed the "low mileage bias".
<INT> Available research suggests that older driver crash risk estimates based on traditional exposure measures are prone to bias.
<INT> When annual driving distances are taken in to consideration, older drivers with low driving distances have an increased crash risk, while those with average or high driving distances tend to be safer drivers when compared to other age groups.
<INT> In addition, older drivers with lower distance driving tend to drive in urban areas which, due to more complex and demanding traffic patterns, tend to be more accident-prone.
<INT> Failure to control for actual annual driving distances and driving locations among older drivers is referred to as "low mileage bias" in older driver mobility research.
<INT> It is also important to note that older drivers are more vulnerable to serious injury and death in the event of a traffic crash due to changes in physiology associated with normal ageing.
<INT> Vision, cognition, and motor functions or skills (e.g., strength, co-ordination, and flexibility) are three key domains required for safe driving.
<INT> It is equally important that drivers must have appropriate peripheral vision to monitor objects and movement to identify possible threats in the driving environment.
<INT> It is, therefore, not surprising that there is agreement among researchers that vision plays a significant role in driving performance.
<INT> Several age-related processes/conditions impair vision, thus it follows that vision testing of older drivers is an important road safety issue.
<INT> The components of visual function essential for driving are acuity, static acuity, dynamic acuity, visual fields, visual attention, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity.
<INT> These indices are typically not fully assessed by licensing agencies.
<INT> Also, current vision screening regulations and cut-off values required to pass a licensing test vary from country to country.
<INT> Although there is a clear need to develop evidence-based and validated tools for vision screening for driving, the effectiveness of existing vision screening tools remains unclear.
<INT> This represents an important and highly warranted initiative to increase road safety worldwide.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> For the update of this review we searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and ISI Web of Science: (CPCI-S & SSCI).
<MaM> The searches were conducted up to 26 September 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> If suitable trials had been available, two review authors would have independently extracted data using a standardised extraction form.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Most countries require a vision screening test for the renewal of an individual's driver's licence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> It is common for palliative care patients to have reduced fluid intake during their illness.
<ABS> Management of this condition includes discussion with the patient, family and staff involved, and may include the provision of fluids with medical assistance.
<ABS> This can be performed using a small plastic tube inserted into a vein or under the skin, or via a tube inserted into the stomach.
<ABS> It is unknown whether this treatment helps people to feel better or live longer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted hydration in adults receiving palliative care.
<ABS> We conducted the searches in April 2013 and March 2014.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> We found only six studies looking at this issue.
<ABS> The studies did not show a significant benefit in the use of medically assisted hydration in palliative care patients; however, there are insufficient good-quality studies to make any definitive recommendations. .
<ABS> As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Many palliative care patients have reduced oral intake during their illness.
<INT> The management of this can include the provision of medically assisted hydration with the aim of prolonging the life of a patient, improving their quality of life, or both.
<INT> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 2, 2008, and updated in February 2011.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effect of medically assisted hydration in palliative care patients on their quality and length of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CANCERLIT, Caresearch, Dissertation abstracts, SCIENCE CITATION INDEX and the reference lists of all eligible studies, key textbooks and previous systematic reviews.
<MaM> The date of the latest search conducted on CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE was March 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We identified six relevant studies for this update.
<MaM> These included three RCTs (222 participants), and three prospective controlled trials (360 participants).
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the studies for quality and validity.
<MaM> The small number of studies and the heterogeneity of the data meant that a quantitative analysis was not possible, so we included a description of the main findings.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One study found that sedation and myoclonus (involuntary contractions of muscles) scores were improved more in the intervention group.
<RES> Another study found that dehydration was significantly higher in the non-hydration group, but that some fluid retention symptoms (pleural effusion, peripheral oedema and ascites) were significantly higher in the hydration group.
<RES> The other four studies (including the three RCTs) did not show significant differences in outcomes between the two groups.
<RES> The only study that had survival as an outcome found no difference in survival between the hydration and control arms.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Since the last version of this review, we found one new study.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Medically assisted nutrition for adult palliative care patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> It is common for palliative care patients to have reduced oral intake during their illness.
<ABS> Management of this condition includes discussion with the patient, family and staff involved, and may include giving nutrition with medical assistance.
<ABS> This can be done either via a plastic tube inserted directly into a vein or into the stomach or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.
<ABS> It is unknown whether this treatment helps people to feel better or live longer.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the international literature for randomised controlled trials looking at the effects of medically assisted nutrition in adults receiving palliative care.
<ABS> Randomised controlled trials allocate patients to one of two or more treatment groups in a random manner and provide the most accurate information on the best treatment.
<ABS> The search was conducted in April 2013 and March 2014.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomised controlled trials.
<ABS> As a result, it is not possible to define the benefits and harms of this treatment clearly.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Many palliative care patients have a reduced oral intake during their illness.
<INT> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2008.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effect of medically assisted nutrition on the quality and length of life of palliative care patients.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the latest search was 26 March 2014.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Since the last version of this review, we found no new studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fish oil contains omega 3 fatty acids that may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, such as seen in the bowel of Crohn's disease patients.
<ABS> Randomized placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the effect of daily intake of capsules containing omega-3 fatty acids to maintain remission in Crohn's disease were reviewed.
<ABS> Six studies including 1039 patients were included in the review.
<ABS> A pooled analysis of six studies suggests a marginal benefit for omega 3 fatty acids over placebo (i.e. fake medicine) in preventing relapse of disease at one year.
<ABS> However, these results need to be interpreted with caution due to differences across the studies in terms of induction of remission regimens (e.g. surgical remission versus drug therapy) patients (e.g. adult versus pediatric patients) and medication regimens (e.g. some studies used different placebos), the possibility of publication bias (i.e. only studies with positive results are published) and low methodological quality in four studies in the pooled analysis.
<ABS> When the two largest and highest quality studies were pooled the results showed no benefit to omega-3 treatment over placebo.
<ABS> There were no serious side effects in any of the studies.
<ABS> Common side effects included unpleasant taste, bad breath, heartburn, nausea and diarrhea.
<ABS> Evidence from two large high quality studies suggests that omega 3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in CD.
<ABS> Omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safe although they may cause diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of n-3 for maintenance of remission in CD were included.
<MaM> Studies must have enrolled patients of any age group, who were in remission at the time of recruitment, and were followed for at least six months.
<MaM> The intervention must have been fish oil or n-3 given in pre-defined dosage.
<MaM> Co-interventions were allowed only if they were balanced between the study groups.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The primary outcome was the relapse rate and secondary outcomes included change in disease activity scores, time to first relapse and adverse events.
<MaM> Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and selected secondary outcomes was reassessed for the current update using the GRADE system.
<MaM> We used the RevMan software for analyses.
<MaM> We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the hazard ratio and 95% CI for time-to-event outcomes.
<MaM> Random-effects or fixed-effect models were used according to degree of heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed in an attempt to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies with a total of 1039 patients were eligible for inclusion.
<RES> The two largest studies were rated as low risk of bias for all assessed items.
<RES> Four studies were rated as unclear risk of bias for randomization and allocation concealment.
<RES> Two studies were rated as high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.
<RES> There was a marginal significant benefit of n-3 therapy for maintenance of remission.
<RES> Thirty-nine per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 47% of placebo patients (6 studies, 1039 patients; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98).
<RES> A GRADE analysis rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. relapse) as very low due to unexplained heterogeneity (I2 = 58%), publication bias, and a high or unknown risk of bias in four studies in the pooled analysis.
<RES> When two large studies at low risk of bias were considered the benefit was no longer statistically significant.
<RES> Thirty-seven per cent of patients in the n-3 group relapsed at 12 months compared to 42% of placebo patients (2 studies, 738 patients; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05).
<RES> No significant heterogeneity was identified for this pooled analysis ( I2 = 0%).
<RES> A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was moderate due to sparse data (294 events).
<RES> No serious adverse events were recorded in any of the studies but in a pooled analyses there was a significantly higher rate of diarrhea (4 studies, 862 patients; RR 1.36 95% CI 1.01 to 1.84) and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms (5 studies, 999 patients; RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.18) in the n-3 treatment group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence from two large high quality studies suggests that omega 3 fatty acids are probably ineffective for maintenance of remission in CD.
<CON> Omega 3 fatty acids appear to be safe although they may cause diarrhea and upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Umckaloabo is a herbal extract derived from the plant Pelargonium sidoides (P. sidoides) and is available in both tablet and liquid forms.
<ABS> The extract is used for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) where antibiotic use is unnecessary.
<ABS> In the light of inappropriate antibiotic use and increasing drug resistance rates worldwide, the need for an alternative, effective remedy for these medical conditions is crucial.
<ABS> On the other hand, there are concerns as to the safety of Umckaloabo.
<ABS> We reviewed 10 randomized clinical trials of which eight were of sufficient quality for inclusion into the analyses.
<ABS> Three trials dealt with acute bronchitis in adults and showed inconsistent but overall positive results for resolution of symptoms (all symptoms, cough and sputum production).
<ABS> For acute bronchitis in children, there were also three studies showing an inconsistent but overall positive combined effect.
<ABS> The available data indicate that the tablet form may be less effective compared to the alcoholic extract.
<ABS> However, the number of trials is not sufficient to prove this.
<ABS> One study each was available for the treatment of acute sinusitis and the common cold in adults.
<ABS> Both showed that the drug was effective in resolving all symptoms including headaches and nasal discharge when taken for an extended time period.
<ABS> Adverse events were more common with P. sidoides, but none were severe.
<ABS> Overall we considered the quality of the evidence low or very low for all major outcomes as there were few studies per disease entity, and all were from the same investigator (the manufacturer) and performed in the same region (Ukraine and Russia).
<ABS> Thus, in summary, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of P. sidoides in the treatment of ARIs.
<ABS> The evidence is up to date as of April 2013.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the efficacy and safety of P. sidoides for the treatment of ARIs in children and adults.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In April 2013 we searched MEDLINE, Journals@Ovid, The Cochrane Library, Biosis Previews, Web of Science, CINAHL, CCMed, XToxline, Global Health, AMED, Derwent Drug File and Backfile, IPA, ISTPB + ISTP/ISSHP, EMBASE, Cambase, LILACS, PubMed component “Supplied by Publisher”, TRIPdatabase, the publisher databases: Deutsches Ärzteblatt, Thieme, Springer, ScienceDirect from Elsevier.
<MaM> We conducted a cited reference search (forward) in Web of Science of relevant papers for inclusion.
<MaM> In addition we searched the study registries ClinicalTrials.gov, Deutsches Register klinischer Studien DRKS (German Clinical Trials Register), International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) – WHO ICTRP, Current Controlled Trials and EU Clinical Trials Register.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of P. sidoides preparations in ARIs compared to placebo or any other treatment.
<MaM> Complete resolution of all symptoms was defined as the primary outcome; in addition, we examined resolution of predefined key symptoms.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors (AT, JG, WK) independently extracted and quality scored the data.
<MaM> We performed separate analyses by age group and disease entity.
<MaM> Subanalysis considered type of preparation (liquid, tablets).
<MaM> We examined heterogeneity using the I2 statistic.
<MaM> We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) using a fixed-effect model if heterogeneity was absent (I2 < 5%; P > 0.1), or a random-effects model in the presence of heterogeneity.
<MaM> If heterogeneity was substantial (I2 > 50%; P < 0.10), a pooled effect was not calculated.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of 10 eligible studies eight were included in the analyses; two were of insufficient quality.
<RES> Three trials (746 patients, low quality of evidence) of efficacy in acute bronchitis in adults showed effectiveness for most outcomes in the liquid preparation but not for tablets.
<RES> Three other trials (819 children, low quality of evidence) showed similar results for acute bronchitis in children.
<RES> For both meta-analyses, we did not pool subtotals due to relevant heterogeneity induced by type of preparation.
<RES> One study in patients with sinusitis (n = 103 adults, very low quality of evidence) showed significant treatment effects (complete resolution at day 21; RR 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 0.62).
<RES> One study in the common cold demonstrated efficacy after 10 days, but not five days (very low quality of evidence).
<RES> We rated the study quality as moderate for all studies (unvalidated outcome assessment, minor attrition problems, investigator-initiated trials only).
<RES> Based on the funnel plot there was suspicion of publication bias.
<RES> There were no valid data for the treatment of other acute respiratory tract infections.
<RES> Adverse events were more common with P. sidoides, but none were serious.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> P. sidoides may be effective in alleviating symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis and the common cold in adults, but doubt exists.
<CON> It may be effective in relieving symptoms in acute bronchitis in adults and children, and sinusitis in adults.
<CON> The overall quality of the evidence was considered low for main outcomes in acute bronchitis in children and adults, and very low for acute sinusitis and the common cold.
<CON> Reliable data on treatment for other ARIs were not identified.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is uncomplicated malaria and how might artesunate-pyronaridine work
<ABS> Uncomplicated malaria is the milder form of malaria which usually causes fever, with or without headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting.
<ABS> If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can rapidly develop into severe malaria with kidney failure, fitting, unconsciousness, and eventually death.
<ABS> Plasmodium falciparum is the most common parasite causing malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and causes most of the severe malaria worldwide.
<ABS> The World Health Organization currently recommends countries use one of five different artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat malaria.
<ABS> These combinations contain an artemisinin component (artemether, dihydroartemisinin, or artesunate), which works quickly to clear the parasite from the person's blood, and a longer-acting drug which clears the remaining parasites from the blood and may prevent new Plasmodium infections for several weeks.
<ABS> Artesunate plus pyronaridine is a new combination and in this review we evaluate its effectiveness and safety compared to the other ACTs.
<ABS> After examining the research published up to 16 January 2014, we included six randomized controlled trials, enrolling 3718 children and adults.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Based on studies of mostly older children and adults living in Africa and Southeast Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artemether-lumefantrine at treating uncomplicated malaria and preventing further malaria infections after treatment (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> In a study primarily of older children and adults in Asia, artesunate-pyronaridine is probably as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating P. falciparum malaria and preventing recurrent parasitaemias (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Serious adverse events were rare in people treated with either artesunate-pyronaridine or other ACTs.
<ABS> However, short-lasting liver toxicity was more frequent in people treated with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Authors' conclusions
<ABS> Artesunate-pyronaridine performed well compared to the other two ACT with which it has been compared, but further studies in African and Asian children are required to help clarify whether this combination is an option for first-line treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria are treated using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT).
<INT> ACT combines three-days of a short-acting artemisinin derivative with a longer-acting antimalarial which has a different mode of action.
<INT> Pyronaridine has been reported as an effective antimalarial over two decades of use in parts of Asia, and is currently being evaluated as a partner drug for artesunate.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched reference lists and conference abstracts, and contacted experts for information about ongoing and unpublished trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized controlled trials of artesunate-pyronaridine versus other ACTs in adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
<MaM> For the safety analysis, we also included adverse events data from trials comparing any treatment regimen containing pyronaridine with regimens not containing pyronaridine.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RR) and continuous data using mean differences (MD), and presented all results with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
<MaM> We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included six randomized controlled trials enrolling 3718 children and adults.
<RES> Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artemether-lumefantrine
<RES> In two multicentre trials, enrolling mainly older children and adults from west and south-central Africa, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artemether-lumefantrine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 42 days of follow-up, with no differences between groups (two trials, 1472 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> There were fewer new infections during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.90, two trials, 1720 participants, moderate quality evidence), but no difference was detected over the whole 42 day follow-up (two trials, 1691 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Artesunate-pyronaridine versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<RES> In one multicentre trial, enrolling mainly older children and adults from South East Asia, both artesunate-pyronaridine and artesunate plus mefloquine had fewer than 5% PCR adjusted treatment failures during 28 days follow-up (one trial, 1187 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> PCR-adjusted treatment failures were 6% by day 42 for these treated with artesunate-pyronaridine, and 4% for those with artesunate-mefloquine (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.00, one trial, 1116 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Again, there were fewer new infections during the first 28 days in those given artesunate-pyronaridine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.73, one trial, 1720 participants, moderate quality evidence), but no differences were detected over the whole 42 days (one trial, 1146 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Adverse effects
<RES> Serious adverse events were uncommon in these trials, with no difference detected between artesunate-pyronaridine and comparator ACTs.
<RES> The analysis of liver function tests showed biochemical elevation were four times more frequent with artesunate-pyronaridine than with the other antimalarials (RR 4.17, 95% CI 1.38 to 12.62, four trials, 3523 participants, moderate quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further efficacy and safety studies in African and Asian children are required to clarify whether this combination is an option for first-line treatment.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Risk assessment tools for the prevention of pressure ulcers

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores, pressure sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of localised injury to the skin, underlying tissue or both, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear (tissue distortion resulting from squeezing and stretching soft tissues between bony structures and the skin).
<ABS> Pressure ulcers mainly occur in people who have limited mobility, nerve damage or both.
<ABS> Pressure ulcer risk assessment is part of the process used to identify individuals at risk of developing a pressure ulcer.
<ABS> Risk assessments generally use checklists and their use is recommended by pressure ulcer prevention guidelines.
<ABS> This review found two studies that were eligible for inclusion.
<ABS> The first study found no difference in the number of new pressure ulcers that developed in individuals assessed using the Braden risk assessment compared with an unstructured risk assessment.
<ABS> However, there were methodological limitations with this study.
<ABS> The second study also found no differences in the number of new pressure ulcers that developed in individuals assessed using the Waterlow risk assessment tool, the Ramstadius risk assessment tool, or using clinical judgement alone.
<ABS> This study did not have methodological limitations.
<ABS> Therefore, to date, there are no studies to suggest that the use of risk assessment tools, reduces the number of new pressure ulcers that develop.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> We conducted a review to provide a summary of the evidence pertaining to pressure ulcer risk assessment in clinical practice.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two studies in this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Methodological limitations of this study prevent firm conclusions being drawn.
<CON> There is no reliable evidence to suggest that the use of structured, systematic pressure ulcer risk assessment tools reduces the incidence of pressure ulcers.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> In future, as the population ages, the number of people in our communities suffering with dementia will rise dramatically.
<ABS> This will not only affect the quality of life of people with dementia but also increase the burden on family caregivers, community care, and residential care services.
<ABS> Exercise one lifestyle factor identified as a potential means of reducing or delaying progression of the symptoms of dementia.
<ABS> Study Charateristics
<ABS> This review evaluated the results of 16 trials (search date August 2012), including 937 participants, that tested whether exercise programs could improve cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, depression, and mortality in older people with dementia or benefit their family caregivers.
<ABS> Key Findings
<ABS> There was promising evidence that exercise programs can significantly improve the cognitive functioning of people with dementia and their ability to perform daily activities, but there was a lot of variation between trial results that we were not able to explain.
<ABS> The studies showed no significant effect of exercise on mood.
<ABS> There was little or no evidence regarding the other outcomes listed above.
<ABS> Further well-designed research is required to examine these outcomes and to determine the best type of exercise program for people with different types and severity of dementia.
<ABS> Quality of Evidence
<ABS> Twelve additional trials were included in this updated review compared with the four included in the previous version of the review.
<ABS> As a result the number of participants increased to 937 at baseline and 798 (85.2%) completed the trials, compared with 280 at baseline and 208 (74%) completing the trials in our previous review.
<ABS> These are encouraging results.
<ABS> The number and quality of included trials were sufficient to address the first three objectives relating to the effect of exercise on cognition, ADLs, and depression.
<ABS> The authors have no conflicts of interest.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of our previous 2008 review.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The search terms used were: 'physical activity' OR exercise OR cycling OR swim* OR gym* OR walk* OR danc* OR yoga OR ‘tai chi’.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> Data were analysed for summary effects using RevMan 5.1 software.
<MaM> We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model.
<MaM> We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program.
<MaM> We also evaluated adverse events.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Sixteen trials with 937 participants met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> However, the required data from three trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available.
<RES> The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration and frequency of exercise.
<RES> Only two trials included participants living at home.
<RES> Our meta-analysis suggested that exercise programs might have a significant impact on improving cognitive functioning (eight trials, 329 participants; SMD 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.09).
<RES> However, there was substantial heterogeneity between trials (I2 value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain.
<RES> We repeated the analysis omitting one trial, an outlier, that included only participants with moderate or severe dementia.
<RES> This reduced the heterogeneity somewhat (I2 value 68%), and produced a result that was no longer significant (seven trials, 308 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.11 to  0.74).
<RES> We found a significant effect of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs (six studies, 289 participants; SMD 0.68, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.27).
<RES> However, again we observed considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity (I2 value 77%) in this meta-analysis.
<RES> In further analyses, we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program (one study, 40 participants; MD -15.30, 95% CI -24.73 to -5.87), but we found no significant effect of exercise on challenging behaviours (one study, 110 participants; MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.22 to 3.02), or depression (six studies, 341 participants; MD –0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07) .
<RES> We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The programs revealed no significant effect on challenging behaviours or depression.
<CON> There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is a severe mental illness characterised by a persistent and unreactive low mood and loss of all interest and pleasure, usually accompanied by a range of symptoms such as appetite change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of energy, poor concentration, inappropriate guilt and morbid thoughts of death.
<ABS> Although medication and psychological treatments are both effective for major depression, antidepressant drugs remain the mainstay of treatment in moderate to severe major depression.
<ABS> However, head-to-head comparisons of such drugs provide contrasting findings as to whether they are effective.
<ABS> This review of the research on the effect of an antidepressant drug called paroxetine was conducted to shed light on the field of drug treatment for depression.
<ABS> In September 2012 we searched, in a wide ranging way, for all the useful studies (randomised controlled trials) which had been completed which compared paroxetine with any other antidepressant in treating people with depression.
<ABS> One hundred and fifteen studies were included in this review, with a total of 26,134 people.
<ABS> We grouped the studies according to the types of drug they compared paroxetine against; we then analysed the combined findings of these groups of studies.
<ABS> For the primary outcome (number of people who responded to treatment) paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine, but less effective than mirtazapine (in the early phase: one to four weeks follow-up) and probably citalopram (at endpoint: six weeks follow-up).
<ABS> There was some evidence that paroxetine is less well tolerated than agomelatine and St John's Wort, as more patients allocated to paroxetine experienced at least some side effects (though this finding for St John's Wort was only based on one study).
<ABS> In conclusion, some possibly meaningful differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants exist, but no definitive concluions can be drawn due to the limited number of studies per comparison.
<ABS> In addition, most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry, which means they might potentially have overestimated the effect of paroxetine.
<ABS> Therefore, the results of this review should be interpreted with caution.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
<INT> However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone.
<INT> The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched.
<MaM> Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form.
<MaM> Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure.
<MaM> Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included.
<RES> In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs.
<RES> For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence).
<RES> Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence).
<RES> We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months).
<RES> Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum.
<RES> Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings.
<CON> In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data.
<CON> In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine.
<CON> However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point.
<CON> Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials.
<CON> Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry.
<CON> The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We found 102 studies with 666,615 children that met the methodological standards we considered acceptable.
<ABS> There were no negative effects experienced by children who were placed in kinship care.
<ABS> The major limitation of this systematic review is that the quality of research on kinship care is weakened by the poor methods of the included studies.
<ABS> Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Every year a large number of children around the world are removed from their homes because they are maltreated.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We handsearched relevant social work journals and reference lists of published literature reviews, and contacted authors.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently read the titles and abstracts identified in the searches, and selected appropriate studies.
<MaM> Two review authors assessed the eligibility of each study for the evidence base and then evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies.
<MaM> Lastly, we extracted outcome data and entered them into Review Manager 5 software (RevMan) for meta-analysis with the results presented in written and graphical forms.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One-hundred-and-two quasi-experimental studies, with 666,615 children are included in this review.
<RES> The 'Risk of bias' analysis indicates that the evidence base contains studies with unclear risk for selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, reporting bias, and attrition bias, with the highest risk associated with selection bias and the lowest associated with reporting bias.
<RES> For permanency, there was no difference on reunification rates, although children in non-kinship foster care were more likely to be adopted (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.49), while children in kinship foster care were more likely to be in guardianship (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.40).
<RES> Lastly, children in non-kinship foster care were more likely to utilise mental health services (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.37).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> However, this conclusion is tempered by the pronounced methodological and design weaknesses of the included studies.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Aripiprazole versus other atypical antipsychotics

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In many countries in the industrialised world there has been a huge growth in the prescription of medication for people with mental health problems, taken orally as a tablet or by injection.
<ABS> Atypical and second generation antipsychotic drugs have become ever more popular, because they are thought to help people with mental health problems who do not respond quite so well to initial treatment.
<ABS> These newer drugs hold the promise of both reducing symptoms, such as hearing voices or seeing things, and reducing problematic side effects, such as sleepiness, weight gain, and shaking.
<ABS> However, there is little research and comparison of the ways in which drugs differ from one another.
<ABS> This review examines the effectiveness of aripiprazole with other new antipsychotics.
<ABS> Originally the review included 12 research trials.
<ABS> After an update search carried out in November 2012, 162 trials were added.
<ABS> Most of these trials were from China and although new data were added to the review, overall conclusions did not change.
<ABS> The review now has five comparisons with aripiprazole being compared with clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone.
<ABS> For people with schizophrenia it may be important to know that aripiprazole may not be as good or effective as olanzapine but that it has less side effects.
<ABS> Aripiprazole is similar in effectiveness to risperidone and somewhat better than ziprasidone.
<ABS> Aripiprazole had less side- effects than olanzapine and risperidone (such as weight gain, sleepiness, heart problems, shaking and increased cholesterol levels).
<ABS> Aripiprazole was not as good as ziprasidone for dealing with restlessness or people’s inability to sit still.
<ABS> Comparison with other antipsychotic drugs as a group showed that people preferred taking aripiprazole.
<ABS> However, people with schizophrenia as well as mental health professionals and policy makers should know that the evidence is limited and mostly of low or very low quality.
<ABS> More trials and research is required, including on outcomes such as: quality of life; the views of service users and carers; and patient preference.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer from Rethink Mental Illness, Benjamin Gray.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In most western industrialised countries, second generation (atypical) antipsychotics are recommended as first-line drug treatments for people with schizophrenia.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data independently.
<MaM> For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random-effects model.
<MaM> Where possible, we calculated illustrative comparative risks for primary outcomes.
<MaM> For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD), again based on a random-effects model.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias for each included study and used GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We now have included 174 trials involving 17,244 participants.
<RES> Aripiprazole was compared with clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and olanzapine.
<RES> The overall number of participants leaving studies early was 30% to 40%, limiting validity (no differences between groups).
<RES> When compared with clozapine, there were no significant differences for global state (no clinically significant response, n = 2132, 29 RCTs, low quality evidence); mental state (BPRS, n = 426, 5 RCTs, very low quality evidence); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 240, 3 RCTs, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Quality of life score using the WHO-QOL-100 scale demonstrated significant difference, favouring aripiprazole (n = 132, 2 RCTs, RR 2.59 CI 1.43 to 3.74, very low quality evidence).
<RES> General extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were no different between groups (n = 520, 8 RCTs, very low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported general functioning or service use.
<RES> When compared with quetiapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 991, 12 RCTs, low quality evidence); mental state (PANSS positive symptoms, n = 583, 7 RCTs, very low quality evidence); leaving the study early for any reason (n = 168, 2 RCTs, very low quality evidence), or general EPS symptoms (n = 348, 4 RCTs, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Results were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for quality of life (WHO-QOL-100 total score, n = 100, 1 RCT, MD 2.60 CI 1.31 to 3.89, very low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported general functioning or service use.
<RES> When compared with risperidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 6381, 80 RCTs, low quality evidence); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 1239, 12 RCTs, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Data were significantly in favour of aripiprazole for improvement in mental state using the BPRS (n = 570, 5 RCTs, MD 1.33 CI 2.24 to 0.42, very low quality evidence); with higher adverse effects seen in participants receiving risperidone of general EPS symptoms (n = 2605, 31 RCTs, RR 0.39 CI 0.31 to 0.50, low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use.
<RES> When compared with ziprasidone, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 442, 6 RCTs, very low quality evidence); mental state using the BPRS (n = 247, 1 RCT, very low quality evidence); or leaving the study early for any reason (n = 316, 2 RCTs, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Weight gain was significantly greater in people receiving aripiprazole (n = 232, 3 RCTs, RR 4.01 CI 1.10 to 14.60, very low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported general functioning, quality of life or service use.
<RES> When compared with olanzapine, there were no significant differences for global state (n = 1739, 11 RCTs, very low quality evidence); mental state using PANSS (n = 1500, 11 RCTs, very low quality evidence); or quality of life using the GQOLI-74 scale (n = 68, 1 RCT, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> Significantly more people receiving aripiprazole left the study early due to any reason (n = 2331, 9 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 1.05 to 1.25, low quality evidence) and significantly more people receiving olanzapine gained weight (n = 1538, 9 RCTs, RR 0.25 CI 0.15 to 0.43, very low quality evidence).
<RES> None of the included studies provided outcome data for the comparisons of 'service use' or 'general functioning'.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Information on all comparisons is of limited quality, is incomplete and problematic to apply clinically.
<CON> The quality of the evidence is all low or very low.
<CON> Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic drug with an important adverse effect profile.
<CON> Long-term data are sparse and there is considerable scope for another update of this review as new data emerge from ongoing larger, independent pragmatic trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing conventional assisted reproduction techniques are at an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation.
<ABS> Since polycystic ovarian syndrome is often associated with the retrieval of immature oocytes, poor fertilisation, and low pregnancy rates, women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing conventional assisted reproduction techniques are at an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation.
<ABS> Thus, these women might benefit from the earlier retrieval of oocytes followed by maturation of the oocytes in the laboratory (in vitro maturation - IVM) as this would reduce the aforementioned risks.
<ABS> However, while successful fertilisation, embryo development, and term pregnancies resulting from IVM oocytes have been reported, along with some concern has been expressed regarding the safety of the method with respect to the health of the children and the rate of congenital anomalies.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence up to May 2013.
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We found no randomised controlled trials with results to help assess the risks and benefits of IVM in infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome as compared to conventional assisted reproduction technology techniques.
<ABS> We are unable to make any recommendations but note that there are three ongoing trials whose results are awaited.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) occurs in 4% to 7% of all women of reproductive age and 50% of women presenting with subfertility.
<INT> Subfertility affects 15% to 20% of couples trying to conceive.
<INT> A significant proportion of these women ultimately need assisted reproductive technology (ART).
<INT> In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of the assisted reproduction techniques employed to raise the chances of achieving a pregnancy.
<INT> In women with PCOS, the supra-physiological doses of gonadotrophins used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) often result in an exaggerated ovarian response, characterised by the development of a large cohort of follicles of uneven quality, retrieval of immature oocytes, and increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
<INT> A potentially effective intervention for women with PCOS-related subfertility involves earlier retrieval of immature oocytes at the germinal-vesicle stage followed by in vitro maturation (IVM).
<INT> So far, the only data available have derived from observational studies and non-randomised clinical trials.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register of controlled trials to May 2013 for any relevant trials identified from the title, abstract, or keyword sections.
<MaM> This was followed by a search of the electronic database MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL, without language restriction.
<MaM> We also performed a manual search of the references of all retrieved articles; sought unpublished papers and abstracts submitted to international conferences, searched the clinicaltrials.gov and WHO portal registries for submitted protocols of clinical trials, and contacted experts.
<MaM> In addition, we examined the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) fertility assessment and treatment guidelines and handsearched reference lists of relevant articles (from 1970 to May 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors (CS, MK and NV) independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials.
<MaM> Primary outcome measure was live birth rate per randomised woman.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Meanwhile, the results of the above-mentioned ongoing trials are awaited and, of course, further evidence from good quality trials in the field is eagerly anticipated.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Nebulized epinephrine for croup in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Croup is a common childhood illness which primarily affects those between the ages of six months and three years, with a peak annual incidence in the second year of life of nearly five per cent.
<ABS> This review looked at trials of inhaled epinephrine for the treatment of children with croup and is comprised of only eight studies with 225 participants.
<ABS> Of the eight included studies, six were assessed as having low risk of bias and two as unclear risk of bias (based upon assessment of adequate random sequence generation, allocations concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data, and selective reporting).
<ABS> Studies assessed a variety of outcome measures and few studies examined the same outcomes; therefore, most outcomes contained data from a maximum of three studies, and in some cases only single studies.
<ABS> No study measured adverse events.
<ABS> The evidence is current to July 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Croup is a common childhood illness characterized by barky cough, stridor, hoarseness and respiratory distress.
<INT> Children with severe croup are at risk for intubation.
<INT> Nebulized epinephrine may prevent intubation.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of children with croup evaluated in an ED or admitted to hospital.
<MaM> Comparisons were: nebulized epinephrine versus placebo, racemic nebulized epinephrine versus L-epinephrine (an isomer) and nebulized epinephrine delivered by intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) versus nebulized epinephrine without IPPB.
<MaM> Primary outcome was change in croup score post-treatment.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes were rate and duration of intubation and hospitalization, croup return visit, parental anxiety and side effects.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One author extracted data while the second checked accuracy.
<MaM> We use the standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Severity of croup was described as moderate to severe in all included studies.
<RES> Six studies took place in the inpatient setting, one in the ED and one setting was not specified.
<RES> Six of the eight studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias and the risk of bias was unclear in the remaining two studies.
<RES> There was no significant difference in croup score between administration of nebulized epinephrine via IPPB versus nebulization alone at 30 minutes (one RCT, SMD -0.14; 95% CI -1.24 to 0.95) or two hours (SMD -0.72; 95% CI -1.86 to 0.42).
<RES> None of the studies sought or reported data on adverse effects.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Quetiapine versus other atypical antipsychotics for schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic.
<ABS> Second-generation or atypical antipsychotic drugs have become the mainstay of treatment in many countries for people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> Quetiapine may be slightly less effective than risperidone and olanzapine in reducing symptoms, and it may cause less weight gain and fewer side effects and associated problems (such as heart problems and diabetes) than olanzapine and paliperidone, but more than are seen with risperidone and ziprasidone.
<ABS> The limited information tends to suggest that people taking quetiapine may need to be hospitalised more frequently than those taking risperidone or olanzapine.
<ABS> This may lead to higher costs in some settings, but the information is not robust enough to guide managers.
<ABS> This summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray (Benjamin Gray, Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In many countries, second-generation ('atypical') antipsychotic drugs have become the first-line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data independently.
<MaM> We calculated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where appropriate.
<MaM> For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MDs), again based on a random-effects model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No clear mental state differences were noted when quetiapine was compared with clozapine, aripiprazole or ziprasidone.
<RES> Compared with olanzapine, quetiapine produced slightly fewer movement disorders (7 RCTs, n = 1127, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.51, CI 0.32 to 0.81, moderate quality) and less weight gain (8 RCTs, n = 1667, RR 0.68, CI 0.51 to 0.92, moderate quality) and glucose elevation, but increased QTc prolongation (3 RCTs, n = 643, MD 4.81, CI 0.34 to 9.28).
<RES> Compared with risperidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer movement disorders (8 RCTs, n = 2163, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.5, CI 0.36 to 0.69, moderate quality), less prolactin increase (7 RCTs, n = 1733, MD -35.25, CI -43.59 to -26.91) and some related adverse effects but greater cholesterol increase (6 RCTs, n = 1473, MD 8.57, CI 4.85 to 12.29).
<RES> On the basis of limited data, compared with paliperidone, quetiapine induced fewer parkinsonian side effects (1 RCT, n = 319, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.64, CI 0.45 to 0.91, moderate quality) and less prolactin increase (1 RCT, n = 319, MD -49.30, CI -57.80 to -40.80) and weight gain (1 RCT, n = 319, RR weight gain of 7% or more of total body weight 2.52, CI 0.5 to 12.78, moderate quality).
<RES> Compared with ziprasidone, quetiapine induced slightly fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects (1 RCT, n = 522, RR use of antiparkinson medication 0.43, CI 0.2 to 0.93, moderate quality) and less prolactin increase.
<RES> On the other hand, quetiapine was more sedating and led to greater weight gain (2 RCTs, n = 754, RR 2.22, CI 1.35 to 3.63, moderate quality) and cholesterol increase when compared with ziprasidone.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Available evidence from trials suggests that most people who start quetiapine stop taking it within a few weeks (around 60%).
<CON> Comparisons with amisulpride, sertindole and zotepine do not exist.
<CON> Although efficacy data favour olanzapine and risperidone compared with quetiapine, the clinical meaning of these data remains unclear.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Middle ear infections are common, especially among young children, usually causing earache and some temporary (occasionally permanent) hearing loss.
<ABS> Zinc is an essential micronutrient, which has a role in the optimal functioning of the immune system and resistance to infection.
<ABS> It must be consumed regularly as it cannot be stored in the body.
<ABS> Some people, especially children in low- and middle-income countries, may not have adequate zinc intake from food alone.
<ABS> Researchers have examined the potential role of zinc supplements in preventing infective illnesses.
<ABS> Therefore we wanted to discover whether zinc supplements have any role in preventing middle ear infections.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature for studies up to March 2014.
<ABS> We searched for trials which compared middle ear infections in people randomly selected to receive zinc supplements or who did not receive supplements.
<ABS> We found 10 eligible studies, all conducted amongst young children.
<ABS> The total number of participants was 6820.
<ABS> Nine trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries.
<ABS> Seven trials were conducted on healthy children.
<ABS> Participants included both males and females.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> The results of the trials provided no convincing evidence that zinc supplements reduce the occurrence of middle ear infections in healthy children.
<ABS> However, in one small study of severely malnourished children, those receiving zinc supplements had fewer middle ear infections.
<ABS> The only adverse effect was vomiting.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The trial evidence included is generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias.
<ABS> All the included trials included otitis media only as a secondary outcome.
<ABS> Therefore, there was a potential to miss trials which were less publicised or less well indexed within the electronic databases.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Otitis media is inflammation of the middle ear and is usually caused by infection.
<INT> It affects people of all ages but is particularly common in young children.
<INT> Around 164 million people worldwide have long-term hearing loss caused by this condition, 90% of them in low-income countries.
<INT> As zinc supplements prevent pneumonia in disadvantaged children, we wanted to investigate whether zinc supplements could also prevent otitis media.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and methodological quality of the included trials and extracted and analysed data.
<MaM> We combined trial results where appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No new trials were identified for inclusion in this update.
<RES> We identified 12 trials for inclusion, 10 of which contributed outcomes data.
<RES> There were a total of 6820 participants.
<RES> A small trial of 39 infants undergoing treatment for severe malnutrition suggested a benefit of zinc for the mean number of episodes of otitis media (mean difference (MD) -1.12 episodes, 95% CI -2.21 to -0.03).
<RES> Zinc supplements did not seem to cause any serious adverse events but a small minority of children were reported to have vomited shortly after ingestion of the supplements.
<RES> The trial evidence included is generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Blood thinners for the initial treatment of blood clots in patients with cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Patients with cancer are at an increased risk of blood clots.
<ABS> The blood thinner (anticoagulant) administered in the first few days can consist of unfractionated heparin (infused intravenously) or low molecular weight heparin (injected subcutaneously once or twice per day).
<ABS> These two blood thinners may have different effectiveness and safety profiles.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for clinical trials comparing different blood thinners in people with cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of a blood clot.
<ABS> The trials looked at death, recurrent blood clots, bleeding, postphlebitic syndrome (a complication of long-term blood clots), quality of life and levels of blood platelets (which are involved in blood clotting).
<ABS> The evidence is current to February 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> In this systematic review, data from 13 studies suggest that low molecular weight heparin is superior to unfractionated heparin in reducing mortality.
<ABS> However, there is not enough evidence to prove superiority in reducing recurrence of blood clots.
<ABS> We did not find data to compare the safety profile of these two medications.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence was low.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of 9559 identified citations, 16 RCTs were eligible: 13 compared LMWH with UFH, two compared fondaparinux with heparin, and one compared dalteparin with tinzaparin.
<RES> Meta-analysis of 11 studies showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality at three months of follow-up with LMWH compared with UFH (risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.98).
<RES> There was little change in the effect estimate after excluding studies of lower methodologic quality (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.00).
<RES> A meta-analysis of three studies comparing LMWH with UFH showed no statistically significant reduction in VTE recurrence (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.08).
<RES> The overall quality of evidence was low for LMWH versus UFH due to imprecision and likely publication bias.
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences between heparin and fondaparinux for the outcomes of mortality (RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.84), recurrent VTE (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.60), major bleeding (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.39 to1.63), or minor bleeding (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.87 to 2.59).
<RES> The one study comparing dalteparin with tinzaparin found no statistically significant difference in mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.73).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> LMWH is possibly superior to UFH in the initial treatment of VTE in patients with cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver is an important organ of the body and has various functions including generation of energy from food; production of material necessary for congealing, processing, and excretion of drugs and waste products in blood; and filtering out the harmful bacteria that enter the body through the gut.
<ABS> Alcohol abuse and viral infections can cause damage to the liver usually in an insidious manner.
<ABS> Sometimes, the liver damage can be so severe that the liver is unable to carry out the normal functions, which results in liver failure.
<ABS> Liver transplantation is effective in treating liver failure.
<ABS> However, liver transplantation is major surgical procedure and a significant proportion of people develop infective and wound complications because of the medications given to suppress the recipient body mounting a foreign body response to the liver graft (immunosuppressive regimens).
<ABS> Various interventions have been attempted to prevent the bacterial infective complications and wound complications; however, the effectiveness is unknown.
<ABS> We performed a detailed review of the medical literature (to February 2013) to determine the benefits and harms of different interventions to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in liver transplantation.
<ABS> We sought evidence from randomised clinical trials only.
<ABS> When conducted properly, such trials provide the best evidence.
<ABS> Two review authors independently identified the trials and obtained the information from the trials to minimise error.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified seven trials for inclusion including 614 people.
<ABS> Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination (prolonged use of antibiotics to clear bacteria in the gut) versus placebo (inactive intervention) or no treatment.
<ABS> In one trial, people were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic).
<ABS> In one trial, probiotic with prebiotic was compared with prebiotic.
<ABS> In another trial, different doses of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; substance that stimulates the immune response) and placebo were compared.
<ABS> Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation.
<ABS> There were five comparisons: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and G-CSF versus control.
<ABS> There was no trial comparing different antibiotics to prevent bacterial infective complications and wound complications in people undergoing liver transplantation.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparisons.
<ABS> There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons.
<ABS> Overall, 193/611 (31.6%) participants developed infective complications.
<ABS> The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than prebiotics with probiotics group.
<ABS> There was no significant difference between the proportion of people who developed infection and the number of infective complication episodes between groups in any of the other comparisons.
<ABS> Quality of life and serious adverse events in the groups were not reported in any of the trials.
<ABS> There is no clear evidence that any of the interventions may be of benefit.
<ABS> Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the risk of infection compared to prebiotics with probiotics.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were at high risk of systematic errors (there was a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions because of the way the trial was conducted) and random errors (there was a potential to arrive at the wrong conclusions because of the play of chance).
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence is very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in people undergoing liver transplantation.
<ABS> Such trials should include patient-oriented outcomes such as mortality, graft failure, quality of life, length of hospital stay, and serious adverse events related to the treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Bacterial sepsis and wound complications after liver transplantation increase mortality, morbidity, or hospital stay and are likely to increase overall transplant costs.
<INT> All liver transplantation patients receive antibiotic prophylaxis.
<INT> This is an update of our 2008 Cochrane systematic review on the same topic in which we identified seven randomised clinical trials.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to February 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included only randomised clinical trials irrespective of language or publication status.
<MaM> We excluded quasi-randomised and other observational studies for assessment of benefits, but not for harms.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors collected the data independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified only seven trials for inclusion, including 614 participants.
<RES> Only one trial was of low risk of bias risk.
<RES> Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<RES> There were five comparisons in the seven trials: selective bowel decontamination versus inactive control; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics with probiotics; selective bowel decontamination versus prebiotics; prebiotics with probiotics versus prebiotics; and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) versus control.
<RES> Four trials compared selective bowel decontamination versus placebo or no treatment.
<RES> In one trial, participants were randomised to selective bowel decontamination, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic), or to inactivated lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic).
<RES> In one trial, active lactobacillus with fibres (probiotic with prebiotic) was compared with inactive lactobacillus with fibres (prebiotic).
<RES> In the remaining trial, different doses of G-CSF and placebo were compared.
<RES> There was no trial comparing different antibiotic prophylactic regimens in people undergoing liver transplantation.
<RES> Most trials included adults undergoing elective liver transplantation.
<RES> There was no significant difference in proportion of people who died or required retransplantation between the intervention and control groups in any of the five comparison groups.
<RES> Mortality
<RES> There were no differences between 190 participants (three trials); 5/87 (adjusted proportion: 6.2%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 7/103 (6.8%) in inactive control group; RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.31 to 2.72); 63 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR - not estimable; 64 participants (one trial); 0/32 (0%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 0/65 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR - not estimable; and 194 participants (one trial); 22/124 (17.7%) in G-CSF group versus 10/70 (14.3%) in placebo group; RR 1.24 (95% 0.62 to 2.47).
<RES> Retransplantation
<RES> There were no differences between 132 participants (two trials); 4/58 (adjusted proportion: 6.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 6/74 (8.1%) in inactive control group; RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.26 to 2.85); 63 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/31 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 2.91 (0.12 to 68.81); 64 participants (one trial); 1/32 (3.1%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 0/32 (0%) in prebiotics group; RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.13 to 71.00); 129 participants (two trials); 0/64 (0%) in prebiotics with probiotics group versus 1/65 (1.5%) in prebiotics group; RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.01 to 7.9); and 194 participants (one trial); 10/124 (7.1%) in G-CSF group versus 5/70 (7.1%) in placebo group; RR 1.13 (95% CI 0.4 to 3.17).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the graft rejections, intensive therapy unit stay, or hospital stay between the intervention and control groups in any of the comparisons.
<RES> Overall, 193/611 participants (31.6%) developed infective complications.
<RES> The proportion of people who developed infective complications and the number of infective complication episodes were significantly higher in the selective bowel decontamination group than in the prebiotics with probiotics group (1 study; 63 participants; 15/32 (46.9%) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 (12.9%) in prebiotics with probiotics group; RR 3.63; 95% CI 1.36 to 9.74 and 23/32 participants (0.72 infective complications per participant) in selective bowel decontamination group versus 4/31 participants (0.13 infective complications per participant) in prebiotics with probiotics group; rate ratio 5.58; 95% CI 1.94 to 16.09).
<RES> There was no significant difference between the proportion of participants who developed infection and the number of infection episodes between the intervention group and control group in any of the other comparisons.
<RES> No trials reported quality of life and overall serious adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, there is no clear evidence for any intervention offering significant benefits in the reduction of bacterial infections and wound complications in liver transplantation.
<CON> Selective bowel decontamination may even increase the rate of infections compared with prebiotics with probiotics.
<CON> The confidence intervals were wide and further randomised clinical trials of low risk of bias are necessary.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Atherectomy for peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A person with diseased arteries in the legs can experience pain on walking (also known as intermittent claudication), pain at rest (especially at night), or ulcers due to poor blood flow.
<ABS> Established treatments include surgery, where a bypass is inserted to carry blood from an artery above the diseased (blocked or narrowed) section to below the diseased section, and balloon angioplasty, where a deflated balloon is inserted into the vessel and then blown up to stretch the artery thus opening up the narrow or blocked section.
<ABS> Stents may be inserted during angioplasty.
<ABS> In addition to these two established treatments, a less commonly used technique is to core out the artery, cutting or grinding away the disease which is causing the vessel to narrow or block.
<ABS> This is known as atherectomy.
<ABS> In this review, we compared atherectomy to the more established treatments such as balloon angioplasty and bypass surgery.
<ABS> We identified four studies with a total of 220 participants.
<ABS> All studies compared atherectomy with balloon angioplasty.
<ABS> The studies were of low quality as there was no blinding of the procedures, the studies were not properly powered to show an effect, not all study outcomes were reported and a large number of the initial study populations did not complete the studies.
<ABS> Although the results of the meta-analyses were imprecise, the average effect of the two treatments was similar in terms of initial success and unobstructed arteries (patency) at six months or 12 months following the procedure.
<ABS> There was a lower risk of death with atherectomy, most likely due to an unexpectedly high number of deaths in the balloon angioplasty group in one of the two trials reporting deaths.
<ABS> Cardiovascular events were not reported in any of the included studies.
<ABS> There was a reduction in the rate of emergency stenting procedures following atherectomy, and balloon inflation pressures were lower following atherectomy.
<ABS> Complications such as formation of clots (embolisation) and tears along the vessels (vessel dissection) were reported in two trials indicating more embolisations in the atherectomy group and more vessel dissections in the angioplasty group but the data could not be combined.
<ABS> The limited data available indicated that there was no clear evidence of a difference between the atherectomy and balloon angioplasty groups for adverse events such as the need for re-intervention due to obstruction of the treated vessel and above-knee amputation.
<ABS> Quality of life and clinical and symptomatic outcomes such as walking distance or symptom relief were not reported in the studies.
<ABS> We showed that the limited evidence available does not support a significant advantage of atherectomy over conventional balloon angioplasty.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Atherectomy is an alternative technique where atheroma is excised by a rotating cutting blade.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched November 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 10).
<MaM> Trials databases were searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing atherectomy and other established treatments were selected for inclusion.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Any disagreements were resolved through discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four trials were included with a total of 220 participants (118 treated with atherectomy, 102 treated with balloon angioplasty) and 259 treated vessels (129 treated with atherectomy, 130 treated with balloon angioplasty).
<RES> All studies compared atherectomy with angioplasty.
<RES> No study was properly powered or assessors blinded to the procedures and there was a high risk of selection, attrition, detection and reporting biases.
<RES> The estimated risk of success was similar between the treatment modalities although the confidence interval (CI) was compatible with small benefits of either treatment for the initial procedural success rate (Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.91, P = 0.82), patency at six months (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.66, P = 0.79) and patency at 12 months (Mantel-Haenszel RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.90, P = 0.53) following the procedure.
<RES> The reduction in all-cause mortality with atherectomy was most likely due to an unexpectedly high mortality in the balloon angioplasty group in one of the two trials that reported mortality (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.91, P = 0.04).
<RES> Cardiovascular events were not reported in any study.
<RES> There was a reduction in the rate of bailout stenting following atherectomy (Mantel-Haenszel RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84, P = 0.01), and balloon inflation pressures were lower following atherectomy (mean difference -2.73 mmHg, 95% CI -3.48 to -1.98, P < 0.00001).
<RES> Complications such as embolisation and vessel dissection were reported in two trials indicating more embolisations in the atherectomy group and more vessel dissections in the angioplasty group, but the data could not be pooled.
<RES> From the limited data available, there was no clear evidence of different rates of adverse events between the atherectomy and balloon angioplasty groups for target vessel revascularisation and above-knee amputation.
<RES> Quality of life and clinical and symptomatic outcomes such as walking distance or symptom relief were not reported in the studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review has identified poor quality evidence to support atherectomy as an alternative to balloon angioplasty in maintaining primary patency at any time interval.
<CON> There was no evidence for superiority of atherectomy over angioplasty on any outcome, and distal embolisation was not reported in all trials of atherectomy.
<CON> Properly powered trials are recommended.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background on the condition
<ABS> Acute urinary retention in men is a medical emergency characterised by the sudden and often painful inability to pass urine.
<ABS> There are many known causes including prostate obstruction (because of enlargement of the prostate or cancer), urethral strictures (a narrowing of the urethra due to scar tissue), urine infection, constipation and neurological conditions.
<ABS> A narrow drainage tube (urinary catheter) is temporarily inserted into the bladder through the penis to allow drainage of urine.
<ABS> Once the catheter is removed, some men fail to pass urine again and need to be re-catheterised.
<ABS> In these men, continued use of catheters or prostate surgery are the standard treatment options.
<ABS> Catheters are associated with risks such as infection and can harm quality of life.
<ABS> Measures for increasing the rate of successful catheter removal, that is, enabling patients to urinate spontaneously again, are therefore potentially beneficial.
<ABS> Alpha blockers (for example tamsulosin, alfuzosin) are a group of drugs known to have positive effects on urinary symptoms such as poor urinary flow.
<ABS> It is believed that their relaxing effect on the prostate may also increase the chance to void again after catheter removal.
<ABS> This review evaluated the evidence available to support this practice.
<ABS> The main findings of the review
<ABS> In nine clinical trials men were either given a dummy tablet (placebo, inactive drug), an alpha blocker for one to three days (in one study up to a maximum of eight days and in another for 32 days) or no treatment before the catheter was removed.
<ABS> In ideal circumstances, neither patients nor doctors knew which type of tablet was given, to prevent the bias in reporting the results.
<ABS> The results suggested that alpha blocker treatment increased the chances of successful catheter removal and return to urination although the overall scientific evidence available to support this was limited.
<ABS> Four different alpha blockers were tested (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin and silodosin).
<ABS> Their results were similar except for doxazosin which did not seem to make a significant difference.
<ABS> Adverse effects
<ABS> Side effects caused by alpha blockers were few and comparable to placebo or no treatment, though this evidence was limited.
<ABS> They included retrograde ejaculation, dizziness, low blood pressure, fainting, sleepiness, feeling unwell and headache.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> There was some evidence to say that alpha blockers also reduce the risk of suffering another (recurrent) episode of urinary retention after successful catheter removal, though it remains unclear whether they reduce the need for future surgery on the prostate.
<ABS> It is therefore unclear whether, or for how long, alpha blocker treatment should be continued after successful catheter removal and whether the costs of alpha blocker treatment in such situations are justified.
<ABS> Further research is needed to answer these questions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute urinary retention is a urological emergency in men and requires urgent catheterisation.
<INT> Any intervention which aims at improving urinary symptoms following an acute urinary retention episode could be potentially beneficial.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of alpha blockers on successful resumption of micturition following removal of a urethral urinary catheter after an episode of acute urinary retention in men.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> No language or other restrictions were imposed on the searches.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently examined all the citations and abstracts derived from the search strategy.
<MaM> Any disagreement about trial selection and inclusion was resolved by discussion.
<MaM> A third independent judgement was sought where disagreement persisted.
<MaM> Two review authors extracted independently, cross-checked and processed the data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention.
<MaM> Quality of evidence of the critical outcomes was assessed by adopting the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine randomised clinical trials were included in this review.
<RES> Eight trials compared alpha blockers versus placebo (five trials tested alfuzosin and two trials tested tamsulosin, one trial tested both alfuzosin and tamsulosin, one trial tested silodosin) and one trial compared an alpha blocker (doxazosin) versus no treatment.
<RES> Trial without catheter was performed after treatment with the drug for one to three days in seven trials and for eight and 32 days in two other trials respectively.
<RES> There was moderate quality evidence to suggest that the rate of successful trial without catheter favoured alpha blockers over placebo ( 366/608, 60.2%, of men using an alpha blocker were able to void spontaneously after catheter removal compared with 185/486, 38.1%, using placebo, risk ratio (RR) 1.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.76).
<RES> The incidence of recurrent acute urinary retention was lower in groups treated with an alpha blocker (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79).
<RES> This evidence was of moderate quality and was statistically significant for alfuzosin, tamsulosin and silodosin, though not for doxazosin.
<RES> Of the trials mentioning adverse effects (for example, postural hypotension, dizziness), there was not enough information to detect statistically significant differences between the groups (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.89) and the evidence was of low quality.
<RES> Overall, adverse effect rates were low for both placebo and alpha blockers and, for example, vasodilatation-related adverse effects did not often result in discontinuation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was some evidence to suggest that alpha blockers increase the success rates of trial without catheter, and the incidence of adverse effects was low.
<CON> There was some evidence of a decreased incidence of acute urinary retention.
<CON> The need for further surgery, cost effectiveness and recommended duration of alpha blocker treatment after successful trial without catheter remain unknown as these were not reported by any trial.
<CON> There is a lack of internationally agreed outcome measures for what constitutes successful trial without catheter.
<CON> This makes meta-analysis difficult.
<CON> Large, well-designed controlled trials, which use the recommendations set out in the CONSORT statement, and include clinically important outcome measures, are required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Detoxification treatment for heroin dependents adolescents
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effect of detoxification treatment compared with pharmacological maintenance treatment or psychosocial intervention in achieving abstinence on adolescents heroin dependents.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Substance abuse among adolescents (13 to 18 years old) is a serious and growing problem.
<ABS> It is important to identify effective treatments for those who are opioid dependent.
<ABS> For adults, pharmacotherapy is a necessary and acceptable part of effective treatment.
<ABS> Detoxification agents are used to reduce withdrawal symptoms during managed withdrawal but the rate of completion of detoxification tends to be low, and rates of relapse are high.
<ABS> Withdrawal symptoms, particularly drug craving, may continue for weeks and even months after detoxification.
<ABS> The time to recovery from addiction is typically influenced by a range of psychological, social and treatment-related factors.
<ABS> Detoxification treatments include methadone, buprenorphine, and alpha2-adrenergic agonists.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the literature for randomised controlled trials investigating pharmacological interventions with or without psychosocial intervention aimed at detoxification in adolescents.
<ABS> The other trial compared maintenance treatment versus detoxification treatment: buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance versus buprenorphine detoxification.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The trial comparing buprenorphine with clonidine reported a trend in favour of buprenorphine in reducing the drop-out rate but no difference between treatments in the duration and severity of withdrawal symptoms.
<ABS> More participants in the buprenorphine group went on to long-term naltrexone treatment.
<ABS> Side effects were not reported.
<ABS> In the second trial comparing buprenorphine maintenance versus buprenorphine for detoxification, for drop out the results were in favour of maintenance treatment, At one-year follow-
<ABS> up, self-reported opioid use was clearly less in the maintenance group and more adolescents were enrolled in other addiction programs.
<ABS> Conducting trials with young people may be difficult for both practical and ethical reasons.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review was limited by the very few number of trials retrieved and the quality of the evidence was moderate for the comparison between buprenorphine and clonidine and low for the comparison between buprenorphine detoxification and buprenorphine maintenance.
<ABS> The evidence is current to January 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The scientific literature examining effective treatments for opioid dependent adults clearly indicates that pharmacotherapy is a necessary and acceptable component of effective treatments for opioid dependence.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two trials involving 190 participants were included.
<RES> One trial compared buprenorphine with clonidine for detoxification.
<RES> No difference was found for drop out: risk ratio (RR) 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20 to 1.04) and acceptability of treatment: withdrawal score mean difference (MD): 3.97 (95% CI -1.38 to 9.32).
<RES> More participants in the buprenorphine group initiated naltrexone treatment: RR 11.00 (95% CI 1.58 to 76.55), quality of evidence moderate.
<RES> The other trial compared maintenance treatment versus detoxification treatment: buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance versus buprenorphine detoxification.
<RES> For drop out the results were in favour of maintenance treatment: RR 2.67 (95% CI 1.85, 3.86), as well as for results at follow-up RR 1.36 [95% CI 1.05to 1.76); no differences for use of opiate, quality of evidence low.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It is difficult to draw conclusions on the basis of two trials with few participants.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A lack of vitamin A (vitamin A deficiency) can cause specific problems such as eye and skin problems.
<ABS> It can also be associated with poorer general and respiratory health.
<ABS> Therefore people with cystic fibrosis are usually given regular vitamin A preparations from a very young age.
<ABS> However, too much vitamin A can also cause respiratory and bone problems.
<ABS> The review aimed to show whether giving vitamin A regularly to people with cystic fibrosis is beneficial or not.
<ABS> However, the authors did not find any relevant trials to include in the review.
<ABS> They are therefore unable to draw any conclusions regarding the routine administration of vitamin A supplements and recommend that until further evidence is available, local guidelines are followed regarding this practice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> People with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency are at risk of fat soluble vitamin deficiency as these vitamins (A, D, E and K) are co-absorbed with fat.
<INT> Thus, some cystic fibrosis centres routinely administer these vitamins as supplements but the centres vary in their approach of addressing the possible development of deficiencies in these vitamins.
<INT> Vitamin A deficiency causes predominantly eye and skin problems while supplementation of vitamin A to excessive levels may cause harm to the respiratory and skeletal systems in children.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Intermittent claudication is pain in the leg that is brought on by walking and which is relieved by rest.
<ABS> The pain is a result of insufficient blood flow to the muscles of the leg due to narrowing of the arteries by atherosclerosis.
<ABS> People who have narrowing of the main artery in the thigh, the superficial femoral artery, and intermittent claudication which severely restricts their quality of life or causes dangerous tissue changes in the leg may undergo a procedure known as angioplasty to widen this narrowing.
<ABS> This procedure involves passing a balloon into the narrowed segment and inflating the balloon to push the artery open.
<ABS> In addition to this, a cylindrical piece of metal mesh called a stent may be inserted at the site where the artery has been pushed open with the aim of holding the narrowing open in the future.
<ABS> While stents work well in the arteries of the heart and in other arteries, it is not clear whether adding stents following angioplasty to narrowings of the superficial femoral artery gives any benefit to the patient.
<ABS> We identified 11 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1387 participants.
<ABS> Their average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women.
<ABS> The participants were randomised to have either balloon angioplasty alone or balloon angioplasty with stent placement.
<ABS> At two years, blood flowing through the narrowing in the arteries was no greater in participants with a stent inserted than in those without.
<ABS> There was a small improvement in the distance that the participants with a stent could walk up to one year later.
<ABS> However, when asked about their quality of life there was no improvement, whether a stent was placed or not, up to one year later.
<ABS> There were differences in the included trials; in some trials people with narrowings in other leg arteries were included.
<ABS> There were also differences between trials in the blood thinning drugs given after stent placement, which may change results, as these agents are important in keeping stents working in other parts of the body.
<ABS> These factors led us to the conclusion that there is a small benefit to adding a stent when performing balloon angioplasty for people in whom balloon angioplasty fails.
<ABS> However, there is insufficient evidence to support this approach as routine practice for everyone and future trials should examine whether subgroups of patients may benefit from stenting.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Lower limb peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common, important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis.
<INT> Stenoses or occlusions in the superficial femoral artery may result in intermittent claudication or even critical ischaemia, which may be treated by balloon angioplasty with or without stenting.
<INT> This is the first update of a review published in 2009.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary aim was to determine the effect of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) compared with PTA with bare metal stenting for superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenoses on vessel patency in people with symptomatic (Rutherford categories1 to 6; Fontaine stages II to IV) lower limb peripheral vascular disease.
<OBJ> In addition, we assessed the efficacy of PTA and stenting in improving quality of life, ankle brachial index and treadmill walking distance.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (MC, CT) independently selected suitable trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Furthermore, these two review authors performed assessments of methodological quality and wrote the final manuscript.
<MaM> The third review author (ADM) cross-checked all stages of the review process.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include three new studies in this update, making a total of 11 included trials with 1387 participants.
<RES> The average age was 69 years and all trials included men and women.
<RES> Participants were followed for up to two years.
<RES> There was an improvement in primary duplex patency at six and 12 months in participants treated with PTA plus stent over lesions treated with PTA alone (six months: odds ratio (OR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 7.18, P = 0.02, six studies, 578 participants; 12 months: OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.10, P = 0.04, nine studies, 858 participants).
<RES> This was lost by 24 months (P = 0.06).
<RES> There was a significant angiographic patency benefit at six months (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.17, P = 0.0005, four studies, 329 participants) which was lost by 12 months (OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.00, P = 0.24, five studies, 384 participants).
<RES> Ankle brachial index (ABI) and treadmill walking distance showed no improvement at 12 months (P = 0.49 and P = 0.57 respectively) between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion.
<RES> Three trials (660 participants) reported quality of life, which showed no significant difference between participants treated with PTA alone or PTA with stent insertion at any time interval.
<RES> Antiplatelet therapy protocols and inclusion criteria regarding affected arteries between trials showed marked heterogeneity.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Future trials should focus on quality of life for claudication and limb salvage for critical ischaemia.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Use of progesterone for treating preterm labour

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Premature birth is associated with various medical problems for the newborn including death and long-term health problems.
<ABS> The parents of premature babies can experience emotional turmoil and the economic costs are high for healthcare systems.
<ABS> Various medications have been used to delay the onset of labour and prevent premature deliveries but with limited success.
<ABS> Some of the drugs have side-effects.
<ABS> Progesterone is a hormone that is known to suppress uterine activity and keep the uterus quiescent until term.
<ABS> Medications that mimic this hormone (progestational agents) were first tried in the late 1950s but interest waned.
<ABS> Recently, new trials studying the use of progestational agents both for prevention as well as treatment of preterm labour have been published.
<ABS> This review of the literature found eight randomised controlled trials involving 563 women, but data from only seven studies from a total of 538 women with threatened or established preterm labour with intact membranes contributed data to this updated review.
<ABS> Four trials compared the use of progestational agents versus placebo in women concurrently treated with another drug to reduce uterine contractions (tocolytic agent).
<ABS> Progesterone was used independently in the other four trials compared with another tocolytic agent or placebo.
<ABS> Limited evidence suggests that the use of a progesterone, as a co-treatment, may reduce preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks' gestation and increase birthweight.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence from the seven small studies with contributing data to advocate progestational agents as a tocolytic agent for women presenting with preterm labour.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Prematurity is not only the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality but is associated with long-term impairment.
<INT> Progesterone is known to have an inhibitory effect on uterine contractility and is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of pregnancy until term.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to August 31 2013) and Embase (1974 to 31 August 2013).
<MaM> We checked the reference lists of all included studies to identify any additional studies and communicated with authors and the pharmaceutical industry.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eight studies were included in this review, involving 563 women, but only seven studies, involving 538 women, contributed data for analyses.
<RES> There are some data suggesting that the use of progestational agents results in a reduction of preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks of gestation and an increase in birthweight.
<RES> The use of a progestational agent may also reduce the frequency of uterine contractions, prolong pregnancy and attenuate the shortening of cervical length.
<RES> However, the analysis was limited by the relatively small number of available studies.
<RES> The power of the meta-analysis was also limited by the varying types, dosages and routes of administration of progesterone.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Heliox for croup in children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Helium-oxygen (heliox) treatment for croup in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Croup is an acute illness commonly seen in children up to six years of age but mostly by the age of two.
<ABS> It is triggered by viral infections causing upper airway obstruction with varying degrees of respiratory distress.
<ABS> Mostly, it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care.
<ABS> Croup is characterised by a barking cough, hoarseness, varying degrees of inspiratory stridor (abnormal breathing sound) and chest wall retractions and is usually preceded by one to three days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.
<ABS> The peak croup seasons are autumn and winter but can occur at any time.
<ABS> Corticosteroids are an accepted treatment for moderate to severe croup, supplemented in more severe cases by nebulised epinephrine and oxygen.
<ABS> Epinephrine is often effective and safe but can have undesired effects (such as increased heart rate and anxiety).
<ABS> Corticosteroids improve croup symptoms but it takes time for their full effect to be achieved.
<ABS> In the meantime the child remains at risk of deterioration.
<ABS> This may rarely result in the development of respiratory failure, which may require emergency intubation and ventilation.
<ABS> Therefore, finding a safe and effective treatment to bridge the gap between the administration and effectiveness of the corticosteroids is important for clinical practice.
<ABS> Some studies have shown a benefit of using heliox in children with croup.
<ABS> Heliox, a gas with lower density than air or oxygen, is believed to reduce the resistance to gas flow in narrowed upper airways, potentially improving symptoms and signs of respiratory distress.
<ABS> This review found three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of heliox in 91 children with croup.
<ABS> Heliox did not appear to be more effective than administration of 30% oxygen in children with mild croup.
<ABS> In children with moderate to severe croup who had been administered oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, heliox appeared to be at least as effective as continuous 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine (adrenaline as a fine spray) in one study.
<ABS> It was slightly more effective than no treatment in another study.
<ABS> There were no adverse effects or outcomes reported.
<ABS> The included trials were small and had a number of methodological limitations.
<ABS> Further methodologically well-designed RCTs with more participants are needed to further assess the role of heliox in managing children with moderate to severe croup.
<ABS> The evidence is current to November 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Croup is thought to be triggered by a viral infection and is characterised by respiratory distress due to upper airway inflammation and swelling of the subglottic mucosa in children.
<INT> Mostly it is mild and transient and resolves with supportive care.
<INT> In moderate to severe cases, treatment with corticosteroids and nebulised epinephrine (adrenaline) is required.
<INT> Corticosteroids improve symptoms but it takes time for a full effect to be achieved.
<INT> In the interim, the child is at risk of further deterioration.
<INT> This may rarely result in respiratory failure necessitating emergency intubation and ventilation.
<INT> Nebulised epinephrine may result in dose-related adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension and its benefit may be short-lived.
<INT> Helium-oxygen (heliox) inhalation has shown therapeutic benefit in initial treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and may prevent morbidity and mortality in ventilated neonates.
<INT> Heliox has been used during emergency transport of children with severe croup and anecdotal evidence suggests that heliox relieves respiratory distress.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 10, MEDLINE (1950 to October week 5, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to November 2013), CINAHL (1982 to November 2013), Web of Science (1955 to November 2013) and LILACS (1982 to November 2013).
<MaM> In addition, we searched two clinical trials registries: the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and clinicaltrials.gov (searched 12 November 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified and assessed citations for inclusion.
<MaM> A third review author resolved disagreements.
<MaM> We assessed included trials for allocation concealment, blinding of intervention, completeness of outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other potential sources of bias.
<MaM> We reported mean differences for continuous data and odds ratios for dichotomous data.
<MaM> We descriptively reported data not suitable for statistical analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three RCTs with a total of 91 participants.
<RES> One study compared heliox 70%/30% with 30% humidified oxygen administered for 20 minutes in children with mild croup and found no statistically significant differences in the overall change in croup scores between heliox and the comparator.
<RES> In another study, children with moderate to severe croup were administered intramuscular dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg and either heliox 70%/30% with one to two doses of nebulised saline, or 100% oxygen with one to two doses of nebulised racaemic epinephrine for three hours.
<RES> In this study, the heliox group's croup scores improved significantly more at all time points from 90 minutes onwards.
<RES> However, overall there were no significant differences in croup scores between the groups after four hours using repeated measures analysis.
<RES> In a third study, children with moderate croup all received one dose of oral dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg with heliox 70%/30% for 60 minutes in the intervention group and no treatment in the comparator.
<RES> There was a statistically significant difference in croup scores at 60 minutes in favour of heliox but no significant difference after 120 minutes.
<RES> It was not possible to pool outcomes because the included studies compared different interventions and reported different outcomes.
<RES> No adverse events were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is some evidence to suggest a short-term benefit of heliox inhalation in children with moderate to severe croup who have been administered oral or intramuscular dexamethasone.
<CON> In one study, the benefit appeared to be similar to a combination of 100% oxygen with nebulised epinephrine.
<CON> In another study there was a slight change in croup scores between heliox and controls, with unclear clinical significance.
<CON> In another study in mild croup, the benefit of humidified heliox was equivalent to that of 30% humidified oxygen, suggesting that heliox is not indicated in this group of patients provided that 30% oxygen is available.
<CON> Adequately powered RCTs comparing heliox with standard treatments are needed to further assess the role of heliox in children with moderate to severe croup.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of treatments to prevent or reduce complications affecting the nerves or muscles during the severe, early phase of critical illness.
<ABS> These complications are called critical illness polyneuropathy or myopathy (CIP/CIM) and can affect nerves, muscles or both.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> CIP/CIM is a frequent complication of critical care.
<ABS> CIP/CIM causes weakness of limbs and of muscles used for breathing.
<ABS> These difficulties can make it difficult for the person to come off a ventilator and start rehabilitation.
<ABS> CIP/CIM can also mean a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and increases the risk of death.
<ABS> Recovery takes weeks or months and in severe cases it may be incomplete or absent.
<ABS> Prevention and treatment of CIP/CIM is therefore very important.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at the effects of any treatment to prevent CIP/CIM in adults admitted to an ICU.
<ABS> We identified and analysed five trials that were suitable for inclusion in our review.
<ABS> These trials studied four treatments: intensive insulin therapy (IIT), corticosteroid therapy, early rehabilitation, and electrical muscle stimulation.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> Two trials, with a total of 825 adults staying in ICU for one week or more, studied the effect of IIT versus conventional insulin therapy (CIT) on the incidence of CIP/CIM.
<ABS> IIT aimed to produce normal blood sugar levels (80 to 110 mg/dL) and CIT aimed to avoid high blood sugar (blood sugar over 215 mg/dL).
<ABS> Combining the results of both trials showed moderate quality evidence that IIT reduces CIP/CIM.
<ABS> There was high quality evidence that it reduced time spent on a ventilator, ICU stay and 180-day mortality but not 30-day mortality.
<ABS> There were more episodes of low blood sugar with IIT.
<ABS> Although there was not an increase in deaths within 24 hours of episodes of low blood sugar, low blood sugar remains a concern as it can damage the brain.
<ABS> Neither trial reported the degree of limb weakness or on physical rehabilitation.
<ABS> The results came from a subgroup of people who were in the ICU for a long time, which may also limit the conclusions.
<ABS> The third trial compared corticosteroid therapy with a placebo in 180 people with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
<ABS> Moderate quality evidence suggested no effect of corticosteroids on CIP/CIM (in 92 participants evaluated).
<ABS> High quality evidence showed no effect on 180-day mortality, new serious infections, blood glucose levels on day seven or episodes of suspected or probable pneumonia.
<ABS> There were fewer episodes of shock (a life-threatening condition where there is a lack of blood flow to vital organs).
<ABS> The fourth trial was of on early rehabilitation in 104 participants in a medical ICU.
<ABS> There was moderate quality evidence of a reduction in CIP/CIM in the 82 participants who could be evaluated in the ICU.
<ABS> This effect was not significant when imputation to intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
<ABS> Early rehabilitation reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation but did not affect ICU stay or deaths.
<ABS> The trial reported no serious adverse events.
<ABS> Finally, a trial compared the effect of EMS of the lower limbs to no stimulation.
<ABS> The trial included 140 participants but provided results for only 52 of them.
<ABS> It supplied very low quality evidence that EMS was without effect in preventing CIP/CIM.
<ABS> There was no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation or deaths.
<ABS> Because the EMS and control groups differed in type and severity of disease,   these findings may not be reliable.
<ABS> Results were even less significant when imputation to intention-to-treat analysis was performed.
<ABS> The study found no effect of EMS on duration of mechanical ventilation or deaths.
<ABS> The evidence is up to date as of October 2011.
<ABS> We re-ran the search for studies in December 2013 and identified nine additional potentially eligible studies that we will assess in the next update of the review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an interim update of a review first published in 2009 (Hermans 2009).
<INT> It has been updated to October 2011, with further potentially eligible studies from a December 2013 search characterised as awaiting assessment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 4 October 2011, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE.
<MaM> We checked the bibliographies of identified trials and contacted trial authors and experts in the field.
<MaM> We carried out an additional search of these databases on 6 December 2013 to identify recent studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), examining the effect of any intervention on the incidence of CIP/CIM in people admitted to adult medical or surgical ICUs.
<MaM> The primary outcome was the incidence of CIP/CIM in ICU, based on electrophysiological or clinical examination.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, death at 30 and 180 days after ICU admission and serious adverse events from the treatment regimens.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified five trials that met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> Two trials compared intensive insulin therapy (IIT) to conventional insulin therapy (CIT).
<RES> IIT significantly reduced CIP/CIM in the screened (n = 825; risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.77) and total (n = 2748; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.82) population randomised.
<RES> IIT reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and 180-day mortality, but not 30-day mortality compared with CIT.
<RES> Hypoglycaemia increased with IIT but did not cause early deaths.
<RES> One trial compared corticosteroids with placebo (n = 180).
<RES> The trial found no effect of treatment on CIP/CIM (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.08), 180-day mortality, new infections, glycaemia at day seven, or episodes of pneumonia, but did show a reduction of new shock events.
<RES> Statistical significance was lost when we performed a full intention-to-treat analysis (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.08).
<RES> Duration of mechanical ventilation but not ICU stay was significantly shorter in the intervention group.
<RES> Hospital mortality was not affected but 30- and 180-day mortality results were not available.
<RES> No adverse effects were noticed.
<RES> The last trial found a reduced incidence of CIP/CIM in 52 evaluable participants out of a total of 140 who were randomised to electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) versus no stimulation (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.01).
<RES> These data were prone to bias due to imbalances between treatment groups in this subgroup of participants.
<RES> After we imputed missing data and performed an intention-to-treat analysis, there was still no significant effect (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.15).
<RES> The investigators found no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation and noted no difference in ICU mortality, but did not report 30- and 180-day mortality.
<RES> We updated the searches in December 2013 and identified nine potentially eligible studies that will be assessed for inclusion in the next update of the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate quality evidence from two large trials that intensive insulin therapy reduces CIP/CIM, and high quality evidence that it reduces duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and 180-day mortality, at the expense of hypoglycaemia.
<CON> Consequences and prevention of hypoglycaemia need further study.
<CON> There is moderate quality evidence which suggests no effect of corticosteroids on CIP/CIM and high quality evidence that steroids do not affect secondary outcomes, except for fewer new shock episodes.
<CON> Moderate quality evidence suggests a potential benefit of early rehabilitation on CIP/CIM which is accompanied by a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation but without an effect on ICU stay.
<CON> Very low quality evidence suggests no effect of EMS, although data are prone to bias.
<CON> Strict diagnostic criteria for CIP/CIM are urgently needed for research purposes.
<CON> Large RCTs need to be conducted to further explore the role of early rehabilitation and EMS and to develop new preventive strategies.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Antiviral treatment for preventing postherpetic neuralgia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of antiviral medicines for preventing postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PHN is a painful condition that can occur after shingles (herpes zoster) in the area where the rash occurred.
<ABS> Many people with PHN find that treatments work only a little or not at all.
<ABS> Attention has therefore turned to stopping the development of PHN.
<ABS> Some people suggested that medicines that target the virus that causes shingles (antiviral medicines), given at the time of the rash, might prevent PHN.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to assess the whether antiviral medicines are able to prevent PHN.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified six clinical trials that met our standards for inclusion in the review.
<ABS> They included a total of 1319 participants.
<ABS> We decided that our main measure of whether antiviral medicines work in preventing PHN would be whether or not PHN had developed six months after a first attack of shingles (some of the studies we included of aciclovir measured PHN at four months).
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> Aciclovir, which is an antiviral medicine, was used in five trials (900 participants) and was not better than a placebo (dummy pill) in preventing PHN.
<ABS> In the other trial (419 participants), famciclovir, which is another antiviral drug, was no better than placebo in preventing pain following healing of the shingles rash.
<ABS> The number of side effects with aciclovir and famciclovir was not very different from the number with placebo.
<ABS> The trials did not have any major problems of design or conduct that put the results in doubt, although most of the reports did not provide enough information to fully assess every aspect.
<ABS> We conclude that according to high quality evidence, oral aciclovir was ineffective in reducing the incidence of PHN and there is not enough evidence on other antiviral treatments.
<ABS> There need to be further well-designed trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents with a greater number of participants.
<ABS> Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should include different groups of people, such as those who have lowered immunity.
<ABS> The evidence is current to April 2013, when the searches were last updated.
<ABS> Because new evidence on this topic is slow to emerge, we have scheduled the next update of this review for 2017.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a painful and refractory complication of herpes zoster.
<INT> Treatments are either partially or totally ineffective for many people with PHN.
<INT> Antiviral agents, used at the time of the rash, have been proposed as an intervention to prevent the development of PHN.
<INT> This is the first update since the first publication of the review in 2009.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of antiviral agents in preventing PHN.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 26 April 2013, we updated the searches in the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Chinese Biomedical Retrieval System.
<MaM> We checked the references of published studies to identify additional trials, and contacted authors to obtain additional data.
<MaM> We searched other databases in The Cochrane Library for information for the Discussion and two clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected trials, evaluated the risk of bias in included trials, and extracted and analysed data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six RCTs with a total of 1211 participants were eligible; five trials evaluated oral aciclovir, and one, with 419 participants, evaluated oral famciclovir.
<RES> We were able to conduct meta-analyses as there were sufficient similarities in the included studies, such as the reporting of the presence of PHN, duration of rash before treatment initiation and treatment regimen.
<RES> For our primary outcome, based on three trials (609 participants) we found no significant difference between the aciclovir and control groups in the incidence of PHN four months after the onset of the acute herpetic rash (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.11), nor was there a significant difference at six months (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.27, two trials, 476 participants).
<RES> In four of the trials (692 participants), there was some evidence for a reduction in the incidence of pain four weeks after the onset of rash.
<RES> In the trial of famciclovir versus placebo, neither 500 mg nor 750 mg doses of famciclovir reduced the incidence of herpetic neuralgia significantly.
<RES> The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache for aciclovir, and headache and nausea for famciclovir.
<RES> For neither treatment was the incidence of adverse events significantly different from placebo.
<RES> None of the studies were at high risk of bias, although the risk of bias was unclear in at least one domain for all but one study.
<RES> We found no new RCTs when we updated the searches in April 2013.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is high quality evidence that oral aciclovir does not reduce the incidence of PHN significantly.
<CON> In addition, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments; therefore, further well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate famciclovir or other new antiviral agents in preventing PHN.
<CON> Future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Granulosa cell tumours (GCTs) of the ovary are rare ovarian tumours (2% to 5% of all ovarian cancers).
<ABS> Most ovarian tumours arise from the outer surface layer of the ovary, but GCTs arise from granulosa cells (sex cord cells) within the ovaries that produce oestrogen (primary female sex hormones).
<ABS> These tumours grow relatively slowly and can recur 10 to 15 years after primary treatment.
<ABS> If women with these tumours want to have children, the surgeon usually removes only the diseased ovary.
<ABS> However, standard treatment has consisted of surgery to remove tubes, ovaries and uterus, as most women develop GCTs around the time of the menopause, when fertility is no longer a matter of concern.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Previous studies have assessed chemotherapy (different combination regimens) with or without radiotherapy following surgery.
<ABS> This review aimed to examine the effects of various treatment methods, including fertility-sparing surgery, on the survival of women with GCT of the ovary.
<ABS> Main findings
<ABS> Five retrospective studies (including 535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Two studies, which attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), suggested that no apparent evidence could be found of differences in overall survival between surgical approaches (including whether the surgery was keyhole or open) whether a patient underwent lymphadenectomy (removal of lymph nodes) or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
<ABS> Only percentage of survival for all women combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.
<ABS> One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent only surgery.
<ABS> In three studies, no apparent evidence to suggest that disease recurrence was associated with type of adjuvant chemotherapy or type of surgery, although surgical staging may be important.
<ABS> In one study, disease recurrence was not noted to be different between patients who underwent fertility-sparing surgery, where only the affected fallopian tube and ovary were removed, and those treated with conventional surgery, in which both tubes and ovaries were removed.
<ABS> Given the high overall survival rate, fertility-sparing surgery may be an important treatment option for young patients wishing to have children in the future.
<ABS> Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study.
<ABS> Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies.
<ABS> None of the five studies reported on quality of life.
<ABS> All studies were at very high risk of bias (low quality).
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> All five studies were retrospective (looked at past findings) and were at very high risk of bias (low quality); therefore future studies should look at current evidence in randomised studies on adult GCT of the ovary.
<ABS> Three randomised studies comparing chemotherapy are ongoing.
<ABS> The study that may be able to answer the question regarding best choice of chemotherapy in sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing randomised study comparing the efficacy of two drugs (carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus standard chemotherapy (BEP - bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin).
<ABS> Overall, the evidence in this review is of low quality, which may seriously weaken confidence in the results.
<ABS> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on evidence provided in the future.
<ABS> The effectiveness and safety of different ways of treating patients with adult-onset granulosa cell tumour of the ovary have not yet been assessed by high-quality studies.
<ABS> Such trials are required to assess toxicity and quality of life associated with different treatments and to assess the safety of the types of surgery used.
<ABS> Generally, current evidence is not robust enough to allow recommendations for changes in clinical practice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Granulosa cell tumour is a rare gynaecological tumour of the ovary with recurrences many years after initial diagnosis and treatment.
<INT> Evidence-based management of granulosa cell tumour of the ovary is limited, and treatment has not been standardised.
<INT> Surgery, including fertility-sparing procedures for young women, has traditionally been the standard treatment.
<INT> Adjuvant treatments following surgery have been based on non-randomised trials.
<INT> A combination of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP) has traditionally been used for treatment of advanced and/or recurrent disease that cannot be optimally managed surgically.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 2013.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of included studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> For non-randomised studies, we included studies that used multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline characteristics.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> Studies were heterogeneous with respect to treatment comparisons, so data were not synthesised in meta-analyses, and methods for assessing heterogeneity were not needed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five retrospective cohort studies (535 women with a diagnosis of GCT) that used appropriate statistical methods for adjustment were included in the review.
<RES> Two studies, which carried out multivariate analyses that attempted to identify factors associated with better outcomes (in terms of overall survival), reported no apparent evidence of a difference in overall survival between surgical approaches, whether a participant underwent lymphadenectomy or received adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
<RES> Only percentage of survival for all participants combined was reported in two trials and was not reported at all in one study.
<RES> One study showed that women who received postoperative radiotherapy had lower risk of disease recurrence compared with those who underwent surgery alone (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1 to 0.6, P value 0.04).
<RES> Three studies reportedthat there was no evidence of differences in disease recurrence based on execution and type of adjuvant chemotherapy or on type of surgery or surgical approach, other than that surgical staging may be important.
<RES> One study described no apparent evidence of a difference in disease recurrence between fertility-sparing surgery and conventional surgery.
<RES> Recurrence-free survival was not reported in one study.
<RES> Toxicity and adverse event data were incompletely reported in the five studies.
<RES> None of the five studies reported on quality of life (QoL).
<RES> All studies were at very high risk of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> One study showed a lower recurrence rate with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, although this study was at high risk of bias and the results should be interpreted with caution.
<CON> After evaluating the five small retrospective studies, we are unable to reach any firm conclusions as to the effectiveness and safety of different types and approaches of surgery, including conservative surgery, as well as adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, for management of GCTs of the ovary.
<CON> The available evidence is very limited, and the review provides only low-quality evidence.
<CON> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may alter our findings.
<CON> Ideally, multinational RCTs are needed to answer these questions.
<CON> The disease is relatively rare and generally has a good prognosis.
<CON> RCTs are challenging to conduct, but three ongoing trials have been identified, demonstrating that they are feasible, although two of these studies are single-arm trials.
<CON> The study that may be able to provide answers to the question of which chemotherapeutic regimen should be selected for management of sex cord stromal tumours is an ongoing, randomised, phase 2 study, led by the Gynaecological Oncology Group to compare the efficacy of carboplatin and paclitaxel versus standard BEP.
<CON> These investigators are also looking into the value of inhibin A and inhibin B as predictive biomarkers.
<CON> Additional trials are required to assess toxicity and QoL associated with different treatment regimens as well as the safety of conservative surgical options.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Low pressure versus standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver produces bile, which has many functions, including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat.
<ABS> Bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver) before it reaches the small bowel.
<ABS> Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones.
<ABS> Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult Western population.
<ABS> Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic within a year.
<ABS> Symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin-secreting cells that maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis).
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally performed by inflating the tummy with carbon dioxide gas to permit the organs and structures within the tummy to be viewed so that the surgery can be performed.
<ABS> The gas pressure used to inflate the tummy is usually 12 mm Hg to 16 mm Hg (standard pressure).
<ABS> However, this causes alterations in the blood circulation and may be detrimental.
<ABS> To overcome this, lower pressure has been suggested as an alternative to standard pressure.
<ABS> However, using lower pressure may limit the surgeon's view of the organs and structures within the tummy, possibly resulting in inadvertent damage to the organs or structures.
<ABS> The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy using low pressure or standard pressure.
<ABS> A systematic search of medical literature was performed to identify studies that provided information on the above question.
<ABS> The review authors obtained information from randomised trials only because such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well.
<ABS> Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A total of 1092 patients were studied in 21 trials.
<ABS> Patients were assigned to a low pressure group (509 patients) or a standard pressure group (583 patients).
<ABS> The choice of treatment was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin.
<ABS> Most of the trials included low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully using low pressure in approximately 90% of people undergoing this procedure.
<ABS> No deaths were reported in either low pressure or standard pressure groups in eight trials that reported deaths (total of 434 patients in both groups).
<ABS> Seven trials with 394 patients described complications related to surgery.
<ABS> One participant experienced the outcome of serious adverse events (low pressure group 1/179, 0.6%; standard pressure group 0/215, 0%).
<ABS> Quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work were not reported in any of the trials.
<ABS> The difference in the percentage of people undergoing conversion to open operation (from key-hole operation) between the low pressure group (2/269; 0.8%) and the standard pressure group (2/287; 0.7%) was imprecise.
<ABS> This was reported in 10 studies.
<ABS> No difference was noted in the length of hospital stay between the groups.
<ABS> Operating time was about two minutes longer (very low quality evidence) in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group.
<ABS> Currently no evidence is available to support the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum in low surgical risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum has to be established.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Only one trial including 140 participants was at low risk of bias (low chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of study design).
<ABS> The remaining 20 trials were at high risk of bias (high chance of arriving at wrong conclusions because of trial design).
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials are necessary, particularly in high surgical risk patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A pneumoperitoneum of 12 to 16 mm Hg is used for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the benefits and harms of low pressure pneumoperitoneum compared with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 1092 participants randomly assigned to the low pressure group (509 participants) and the standard pressure group (583 participants) in 21 trials provided information for this review on one or more outcomes.
<RES> Three additional trials comparing low pressure pneumoperitoneum with standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (including 179 participants) provided no information for this review.
<RES> Most of the trials included low anaesthetic risk participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> One trial including 140 participants was at low risk of bias.
<RES> The remaining 20 trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> The overall quality of evidence was low or very low.
<RES> No mortality was reported in either the low pressure group (0/199; 0%) or the standard pressure group (0/235; 0%) in eight trials that reported mortality.
<RES> One participant experienced the outcome of serious adverse events (low pressure group 1/179, 0.6%; standard pressure group 0/215, 0%; seven trials; 394 participants; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 65.90; very low quality evidence).
<RES> Quality of life, return to normal activity, and return to work were not reported in any of the trials.
<RES> The difference between groups in the conversion to open cholecystectomy was imprecise (low pressure group 2/269, adjusted proportion 0.8%; standard pressure group 2/287, 0.7%; 10 trials; 556 participants; RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.29 to 4.72; very low quality evidence) and was compatible with an increase, a decrease, or no difference in the proportion of conversion to open cholecystectomy due to low pressure pneumoperitoneum.
<RES> No difference in the length of hospital stay was reported between the groups (five trials; 415 participants; MD -0.30 days; 95% CI -0.63 to 0.02; low quality evidence).
<RES> Operating time was about two minutes longer in the low pressure group than in the standard pressure group (19 trials; 990 participants; MD 1.51 minutes; 95% CI 0.07 to 2.94; very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be completed successfully using low pressure in approximately 90% of people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> However, no evidence is currently available to support the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum in low anaesthetic risk patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> The safety of low pressure pneumoperitoneum has to be established.
<CON> Further well-designed trials are necessary, particularly in people with cardiopulmonary disorders who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People who have chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of heart disease and worsening kidney disease needing treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant.
<ABS> Increased amounts of protein in the urine are a sign of kidney stress and are linked to a greater chance of worsening kidney function.
<ABS> Treatments that lower urine protein levels and protect kidney function are available and include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.
<ABS> However, protection of kidney function with these two drugs may be incomplete and adding aldosterone blockers (for example, spironolactone or eplerenone) may better protect kidney function.
<ABS> The use of numerous drugs may also increase side-effects.
<ABS> This review of available trials showed that adding aldosterone antagonist treatment to standard therapy reduced protein release into the urine and lowered blood pressure but had uncertain effects on kidney function and survival.
<ABS> Treatment also increases the amount of potassium in the blood which may require treatment changes, extra blood tests and is potentially harmful.
<ABS> Whether aldosterone blockers protect kidney function to lower the chances needing dialysis or kidney transplantation or prevent heart disease in people who have CKD is unclear and not answered by existing research.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is increasingly used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
<INT> However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2009.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis.
<MaM> We tested for heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using the Cochran Q test and I² statistic.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 27 studies (1549 participants) that were eligible for inclusion.
<RES> These studies provided no data relating to aldosterone antagonists in addition to ACEi or ARB (or both) on patient-level outcomes including major cardiovascular events and mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation.
<RES> Compared with ACEi or ARB (or both), non-selective aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) combined with ACEi or ARB (or both) significantly reduced 24-hour protein excretion (11 studies, 596 participants): SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.13).
<RES> There was a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) at the end of treatment with additional non-selective aldosterone antagonist therapy (systolic BP (10 studies, 556 participants): MD -3.44 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.05 to -1.83) (diastolic BP (9 studies, 520 participants): MD -1.73 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.62).
<RES> However, we found that aldosterone antagonist treatment had imprecise effects at the end of treatment on GFR (9 studies, 528 participants; MD -2.55 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.67 to 0.51), doubled the risk of hyperkalaemia (11 studies, 632 patients): RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.20; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH): 7.2, 95% CI 3.4 to ∞) and increased the risk of gynaecomastia compared to ACEi or ARB (or both) (4 studies, 281 patients): RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23; NNTH: 14.1, 95% CI 8.7 to 37.3).
<RES> Most studies enrolled few patients (range 12 to 268) and were powered to observe differences in surrogate end points rather than patient-focused outcomes.
<RES> Nine studies had a cross-over design and the majority of studies did not adequately report study methods to assess methods and study quality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones.
<ABS> Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year.
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone.
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as a port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered to be less painful than open surgery, pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent people from feeling pain) into the surgical wound (local anaesthetic wound infiltration) may be an effective way of decreasing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the benefits and harms of local anaesthetic wound infiltration is not known.
<ABS> We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials on the benefits related to the treatment.
<ABS> When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment.
<ABS> We also considered comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms.
<ABS> Two authors searched the literature until February 2013 and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 19 randomised clinical trials in this review.
<ABS> Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> A total of 1095 participants were randomised to local anaesthetic wound infiltration (587 participants) or no local anaesthetic wound infiltration (508 participants) in 17 trials.
<ABS> The choice of whether the participants received local anaesthetic agents (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments were compared in groups of patients who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in the seven trials (539 participants) that reported deaths.
<ABS> The difference in serious complications between the groups was imprecise.
<ABS> There were no local anaesthetic-related complications in nearly 450 participants who received local anaesthetic wound infiltration in the different trials that reported complications.
<ABS> None of the trials reported quality of life or the time taken to return to work.
<ABS> The proportion of participants who were discharged as day surgery patients was higher in the local anaesthetic group than in the control group in the only trial that reported this information.
<ABS> The difference in the length of hospital stay or the time taken to return to normal activity was imprecise.
<ABS> Pain was lower in the participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration compared with those in the control groups at four to eight hours and at nine to 24 hours, as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart which rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10).
<ABS> In the comparisons of different methods of local anaesthetic infiltration, there were differences between the groups in some outcomes but the changes were not consistent.
<ABS> There is, therefore, no evidence to prefer any particular drug or method of administering local anaesthetics.
<ABS> Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic wound infiltration.
<ABS> There is very low quality evidence that infiltration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were at high risk of bias, that is there is a possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions by overestimating the benefits or underestimating the harms of one method over another because of the way a study was conducted.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary.
<ABS> Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, hospital stay, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The safety and effectiveness of local anaesthetic wound infiltration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2013 to identify studies of relevance to this review.
<MaM> We included randomised clinical trials for benefit and quasi-randomised and comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors collected the data independently.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis models using RevMan.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-six trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review.
<RES> All the 26 trials except one trial of 30 participants were at high risk of bias.
<RES> Nineteen of the trials with 1263 randomised participants provided data for this review.
<RES> Ten of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control.
<RES> One of the 19 trials compared local anaesthetic wound infiltration with two inactive controls, normal saline and no intervention.
<RES> Two of the 19 trials had four arms comparing local anaesthetic wound infiltration with inactive controls in the presence and absence of co-interventions to decrease pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> Four of the 19 trials had three or more arms that could be included for the comparison of local anaesthetic wound infiltration versus inactive control and different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration.
<RES> The remaining two trials compared different methods of local anaesthetic wound infiltration.
<RES> Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> Seventeen trials randomised a total of 1095 participants to local anaesthetic wound infiltration (587 participants) versus no local anaesthetic wound infiltration (508 participants).
<RES> Various anaesthetic agents were used but bupivacaine was the commonest local anaesthetic used.
<RES> There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (0/280 (0%) in local anaesthetic infiltration group versus 0/259 (0%) in control group).
<RES> The effect of local anaesthetic on the proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was imprecise and compatible with increase or no difference in serious adverse events (seven trials; 539 participants; 2/280 (0.8%) in local anaesthetic group versus 1/259 (0.4%) in control; RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.19 to 21.59; very low quality evidence).
<RES> None of the serious adverse events were related to local anaesthetic wound infiltration.
<RES> None of the trials reported patient quality of life.
<RES> The proportion of participants who were discharged as day surgery patients was higher in the local anaesthetic infiltration group than in the no local anaesthetic infiltration group (one trial; 97 participants; 33/50 (66.0%) in the local anaesthetic group versus 20/47 (42.6%) in the control group; RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.28; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The effect of local anaesthetic on the length of hospital stay was compatible with a decrease, increase, or no difference in the length of hospital stay between the two groups (four trials; 327 participants; MD -0.26 days; 95% CI -0.67 to 0.16; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (0 to 10 cm) were lower in the local anaesthetic infiltration group than the control group at 4 to 8 hours (13 trials; 806 participants; MD -1.33 cm on the VAS; 95% CI -1.54 to -1.12; very low quality evidence) and 9 to 24 hours (12 trials; 756 participants; MD -0.36 cm on the VAS; 95% CI -0.53 to -0.20; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The effect of local anaesthetic on the time taken to return to normal activity between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with a decrease, increase, or no difference in the time taken to return to normal activity (two trials; 195 participants; MD 0.14 days; 95% CI -0.59 to 0.87; very low quality evidence).
<RES> None of the trials reported on return to work.
<RES> Four trials randomised a total of 149 participants to local anaesthetic wound infiltration prior to skin incision (74 participants) versus local anaesthetic wound infiltration at the end of surgery (75 participants).
<RES> Two trials randomised a total of 176 participants to four different local anaesthetics (bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, ropivacaine, neosaxitoxin).
<RES> Although there were differences between the groups in some outcomes the changes were not consistent.
<RES> There was no evidence to support the preference of one local anaesthetic over another or to prefer administration of local anaesthetic at a specific time compared with another.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic wound infiltration (very low quality evidence).
<CON> There is very low quality evidence that infiltration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small.
<CON> Further randomised clinical trials at low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Comparison of two surgical techniques for the control of eye pressure in people with glaucoma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Increased eye pressure is the major risk factor for developing glaucoma (a group of eye diseases that lead to progressive, irreversible damage to the optic nerve (the nerve that transmits visual information from the retina to the brain)).
<ABS> Glaucoma is the second biggest cause of blindness worldwide.
<ABS> Eye pressure can be controlled surgically.
<ABS> Trabeculectomy (penetrating eye surgery) is the removal of a full-thickness block of the trabecular meshwork (eye filtration tissue) to make a hole that allows aqueous (watery fluid present in the front part of the eyes and partly responsible for eye pressure) to filter out of the eye.
<ABS> It is the standard surgical procedure and has been widely practised for over 40 years.
<ABS> Non-penetrating filtering surgical procedures, in which aqueous is allowed to filter out without the removal of a full-thickness block of trabecular tissue, also aim to control eye pressure and have the reputation of being safer than trabeculectomy.
<ABS> The most widely practised non-penetrating surgical procedures for glaucoma are viscocanalostomy and deep sclerectomy.
<ABS> Each procedure involves a different level of partial-thickness surgical dissection into the eye filtration tissue.
<ABS> Surgical success is defined as lowering the eye pressure to normal limits (less than 21 mmHg) for at least 12 months after surgery.
<ABS> This review included five trials with 311 eyes (267 participants).
<ABS> These studies included 160 eyes which had trabeculectomy compared to 151 eyes that had non-penetrating glaucoma surgery, of which 101 eyes had deep sclerectomy and 50 eyes had viscocanalostomy.
<ABS> This review showed that trabeculectomy is better in terms of achieving total success (pressure controlled without eyedrops) than non-penetrating filtering procedures.
<ABS> Although when we looked at the outcome of partial success (pressure controlled with additional eyedrops) it was more imprecise and our results could not exclude one surgical approach being better than the other.
<ABS> However, the review noted that these studies had some limitations regarding their design and were too small to give definitive information on differences in complications following surgery.
<ABS> None of the studies measured quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Glaucoma is the second commonest cause of blindness worldwide.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To compare the effectiveness of non-penetrating trabecular surgery compared with conventional trabeculectomy in people with glaucoma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to September 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to September 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 27 September 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of the search results.
<MaM> We obtained full copies of all potentially eligible studies and assessed each one according to the definitions in the 'Criteria for considering studies' section of this review.
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five studies with a total of 311 eyes (247 participants) of which 133 eyes (participants) were quasi-randomised.
<RES> One hundred and sixty eyes which had trabeculectomy were compared to 151 eyes that had non-penetrating glaucoma surgery (of which 101 eyes had deep sclerectomy and 50 eyes had viscocanalostomy).
<RES> The confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) of success (defined as achieving target eye pressure without eye drops) does not exclude a beneficial effect of either deep sclerectomy or trabeculectomy (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.88).
<RES> The odds of success in viscocanalostomy participants was lower than in trabeculectomy participants (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.81).
<RES> We did not combine the different types of non-penetrating surgery because there was evidence of a subgroup difference when examining total success.
<RES> The odds ratio for achieving target eye pressure with or without eye drops was imprecise and was compatible with a beneficial effect of either trabeculectomy or non-penetrating filtration surgery (NPFS) (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.79).
<RES> Operative adjuvants were used in both treatment groups; more commonly in the NPFS group compared to the trabeculectomy group but no clear effect of their use could be determined.
<RES> Although the studies were too small to provide definitive evidence regarding the relative safety of the surgical procedures we noted that there were relatively fewer complications with non-filtering surgery compared to trabeculectomy (17% and 65% respectively).
<RES> Cataract was more commonly reported in the trabeculectomy studies.
<RES> None of the five trials used quality of life measure questionnaires.
<RES> The methodological quality of the studies was not good.
<RES> Most studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain and for many, there was lack of certainty due to incomplete reporting.
<RES> Adequate sequence generation was noted only in one study.
<RES> Similarly, only two studies avoided detection bias.
<RES> We detected incomplete outcome data in three of the included studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review provides some limited evidence that control of IOP is better with trabeculectomy than viscocanalostomy.
<CON> For deep sclerectomy, we cannot draw any useful conclusions.
<CON> This may reflect surgical difficulties in performing non-penetrating procedures and the need for surgical experience.
<CON> This review has highlighted the lack of use of quality of life outcomes and the need for higher methodological quality RCTs to address these issues.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) accounts for one-third of preterm births.
<ABS> Infants who are born before 37 weeks may suffer from problems related to prematurity, including death.
<ABS> Medications that aim to stop labor are often given in an attempt to prevent preterm birth.
<ABS> It is unclear whether these medications should be used in women with PPROM.
<ABS> This review of eight studies (involving 408 women) found that these medications do not effect perinatal death, but do increase latency and may increase maternal (e.g., chorioamnionitis) and neonatal morbidity (e.g., five-minute Apgar of less than seven and increased need for ventilation of the neonate).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In women with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), the use of tocolysis is still controversial.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included pregnant women with singleton pregnancies and PPROM (23 weeks to 36 weeks and six days).
<MaM> We included any tocolytic therapy compared to no tocolytic, placebo, or another tocolytic.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All review authors assessed the studies for inclusion.
<MaM> We extracted and quality assessed data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included eight studies with a total of 408 women.
<RES> Seven of the studies compared tocolysis to no tocolysis.
<RES> One study compared nifedipine to terbutaline.
<RES> Compared to no tocolysis, tocolysis was not associated with a significant effect on perinatal mortality in women with PPROM (risk ratio (RR) 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 3.29).
<RES> Tocolysis was associated with longer latency (mean difference (MD) 73.12 hours; 95% CI 20.21 to 126.03; three trials of 198 women) and fewer births within 48 hours (average RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; six trials of 354 women; random-effects, Tau² = 0.18, I² = 43%) compared to no tocolysis.
<RES> However, tocolysis was associated with increased five-minute Apgar of less than seven (RR 6.05; 95% CI 1.65 to 22.23; two trials of 160 women) and increased need for ventilation of the neonate (RR 2.46; 95% CI 1.14 to 5.34; one trial of 81 women).
<RES> In the subgroup analysis comparing betamimetic to no betamimetics, tocolysis was associated with increased latency and borderline significance for chorioamnionitis.
<RES> Prophylactic tocolysis with PPROM was associated with increased overall latency, without additional benefits for maternal/neonatal outcomes.
<RES> For women with PPROM before 34 weeks, there was a significantly increased risk of chorioamnionitis in women who received tocolysis.
<RES> However, neonatal outcomes were not significantly different.
<RES> There were no significant differences in maternal/neonatal outcomes in subgroup analyses comparing cox inhibitor versus no tocolysis, calcium channel blocker versus betamimetic, antibiotic, corticosteroid or combined antibiotic/corticosteroid.

<H1> Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> For women with early breast cancer, removal of the tumour followed by radiation therapy (RT) allows the breast to be kept (breast conserving therapy).
<ABS> A tumour occurring again within the breast can be either a true recurrence (arising in the same area of the breast as the original cancer) or a new primary cancer (another breast cancer arising in another part of the breast).
<ABS> RT reduces the risk of a true recurrence but does not prevent the development of a new primary cancer.
<ABS> RT usually involves treating the whole breast (WBRT) in four to six weeks of daily treatments.
<ABS> RT delivered only to the area of the breast from which the tumour was removed (partial breast irradiation: PBI) offers the potential for preservation of the breast if the tumour then occurs in a previously untreated part of the breast.
<ABS> If RT is also delivered over a shorter period of time (accelerated partial breast irradiation: APBI) than WBRT, fewer visits to the RT department are required, reducing inconvenience for the woman who is treated.
<ABS> In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the role of PBI and APBI against WBRT.
<ABS> We included four completed trials: one had a short follow-up so the information is not mature enough yet, two trials involved RT techniques that do not meet today's standards, and the other trial stopped early.
<ABS> The evidence is current to April 2014.
<ABS> We found local relapse-free survival appeared worse with PBI/APBI than WBRT.
<ABS> When PBI/APBI was compared with WBRT the rates of overall survival were similar, but we could not exclude potentially important differences between treatment groups.
<ABS> This was also the case for the effects of PBI/APBI on cause-specific survival, distant metastasis-free survival, subsequent mastectomy rate and relapse-free survival when PBI/APBI was compared with WBRT.
<ABS> We found no data for: acute toxicity, costs, quality of life or consumer preference.
<ABS> Breast appearance was better with PBI/APBI in a single trial but late adverse events were increased in another trial.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence (low to very low) means we cannot make any recommendations about the benefit of or best way to deliver PBI/APBI.
<ABS> We would only advise the use of PBI/APBI in a trial.
<ABS> We found seven ongoing trials which do reflect modern RT practice and await their completion; it may be possible to answer these questions in a future update of this review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Breast conserving therapy for women with breast cancer consists of local excision of the tumour (achieving clear margins) followed by radiation therapy (RT).
<INT> RT is given to sterilize tumour cells that may remain after surgery to decrease the risk of local tumour recurrence.
<INT> Most true recurrences occur in the same quadrant as the original tumour.
<INT> Whole breast RT may not protect against the development of a new primary cancer developing in other quadrants of the breast.
<INT> In this Cochrane Review, we investigated the role of delivering radiation to a limited volume of the breast around the tumour bed (partial breast irradiation: PBI) sometimes with a shortened treatment duration (accelerated partial breast irradiation: APBI).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register (07 November 2013), CENTRAL (2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 11 April 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 11 April 2014), CINAHL (11 April 2014) and Current Contents (11 April 2014).
<MaM> Also we searched the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (07 November 2013) and US clinical trials registry (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (22 April 2014).
<MaM> We searched for grey literature: Open Grey (23 April 2014), reference lists of articles, a number of conference proceedings and published abstracts, and did not apply any language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included both published and unpublished trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors (ML, DF and BH) performed data extraction and resolved any disagreements through discussion.
<MaM> We entered data into Review Manager for analysis.
<MaM> BH and ML assessed trials, graded the methodological quality using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool and resolved any disagreements through discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs that had 2253 women.
<RES> Two older trials examined RT techniques which do not reflect current practice and one trial had a short follow-up.
<RES> We downgraded the quality of the evidence for our key outcomes due to risk of bias.
<RES> Taken together with other GRADE recommendations, the quality of evidence for our outcomes was very low to low.
<RES> For the comparison of partial breast irradiation/accelerated breast irradiation (PBI/APBI) with whole breast irradiation (WBRT), local recurrence-free survival appeared worse (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 2.45; three trials, 1140 participants, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Cosmesis appeared improved with PBI/APBI in a single trial (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.72; one trial, 241 participants, very low quality evidence), but late toxicity (telangiectasia OR 4.41, 95% CI 3.21 to 6.05; very low quality evidence, 708 participants) and subcutaneous fibrosis (OR 4.27, 95% CI 3.04 to 6.01; one trial, 710 participants, very low quality evidence) appeared increased in another trial.
<RES> We found no clear evidence of a difference for the comparison of PBI/APBI versus WBRT for the outcomes of: overall survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18; three trials, 1140 participants, very low quality evidence), cause-specific survival (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.22; two trials, 966 participants, low evidence quality), distant metastasis-free survival (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.28; 1140 participants, low quality evidence), subsequent mastectomy rate (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.21; 258 participants, low quality evidence) and relapse-free survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.85; 258 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> We found no data for the outcomes of acute toxicity, new ipsilateral breast primaries, costs, quality of life or consumer preference.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We await completion of ongoing trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pain following surgical procedures can sometimes increase the incidence of complications in the body.
<ABS> It is important to manage this pain effectively.
<ABS> Major shoulder surgery can cause severe pain.
<ABS> A wide range of methods are used to treat pain after major shoulder surgery, including administration of opioid (derived from opium) and non-opioid pain killers and administration of drugs that produce numbness and hence pain relief in and around the shoulder joint or around the nerves supplying the upper limb.
<ABS> We compared the usefulness of a continuous upper limb nerve block performed by injecting local anaesthetic into the neck close to where the nerves originate (interscalene brachial plexus block—ISBPB group) with the administration of opioid pain killers into a vein, into a muscle or under the skin (any route other than by mouth)—the parenteral opioid group.
<ABS> Evidence obtained is current to December 2012.
<ABS> We included two studies involving 147 participants.
<ABS> Seventeen participants were excluded (16 from the ISBPB group and one from the other), leaving 130 participants: 66 in the ISBPB group and 64 in the parenteral opioid group.
<ABS> The studies were of medium to low quality because of issues with study design, and one of the trials was sponsored by a drug company.
<ABS> The severity of pain was assessed by the patient using a numerical scale on which zero was considered as no pain and 10 or 100 as the worst imaginable pain for 72 hours in one study and 48 hours in the other.
<ABS> The severity of postoperative pain was significantly less for the ISBPB group at all time points in one study and at all but one time point in the other study.
<ABS> No concrete conclusions can be drawn because of the small number of studies, which were not of high quality.
<ABS> However, from the available evidence, it can be seen that in one of the trials, the requirement for additional painkiller (piritramide) was significantly higher in the parenteral opioid group, whereas the other trial did not mention this.
<ABS> The incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly less in the ISBPB group when compared with the parenteral opioid group.
<ABS> Complications related to ISBPB were virtually eliminated when ultrasound was used to perform ISBPB.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Postoperative pain may lead to adverse effects on the body, which might result in an increase in morbidity.
<INT> Its management therefore poses a unique challenge for the clinician.
<INT> Major shoulder surgery is associated with severe postoperative pain, and different modalities are available to manage such pain, including opioid and non-opioid analgesics, local anaesthetics infiltrated into and around the shoulder joint and regional anaesthesia.
<INT> All of these techniques, alone or in combination, have been used to treat the postoperative pain of major shoulder surgery but with varying success.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two randomized controlled trials (147 participants).
<RES> A total of 17 participants were excluded from one trial because of complications related to continuous ISBPB (16) or parenteral opioid analgesia (one).
<RES> Thus we have information on 130 participants (66 in the continuous ISBPB group and 64 in the parenteral opioid group).
<RES> However, results of the two included studies showed better pain relief with continuous ISBPB following major shoulder surgery and a lower incidence of complications when interscalene block is performed under ultrasound guidance rather than without it.

<H1> Fewer-than-four ports versus four ports for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Fewer-than-four ports versus four ports for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult Western population have gallstones.
<ABS> Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year.
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the main stay treatment for symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the United States alone.
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a key-hole-sized incision, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> In conventional or standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (key hole removal of gallbladder), four ports (two of 10-mm diameter and two of 5-mm diameter) are usually used.
<ABS> The use of fewer ports has been reported (fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy).
<ABS> However, the safety of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy and whether it offers any advantages over four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not known.
<ABS> We sought to answer this question by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials commonly called randomised controlled trials.
<ABS> When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information.
<ABS> Two review authors searched the literature to September 2013 and obtained information from the trials, thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified nine trials that compared fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> In these nine studies, 855 participants were included.
<ABS> The choice of the treatment that the participants received was determined by a method similar to toss of a coin so that the two treatments were given to participants with similar characteristics.
<ABS> Most of these studies included low anaesthetic risk patients undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 90% of participants in most of the trials.
<ABS> The remaining participants were mostly converted to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some participants had to undergo open cholecystectomy (through a large incision in the abdomen).
<ABS> There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (634 participants in the two groups).
<ABS> There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants who developed serious complications, quality of life between 10 and 30 days after operation, proportion of participants in whom the laparoscopic operation had to be converted to open cholecystectomy, or in the length of hospital stay between the groups.
<ABS> Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy took about 15 minutes longer to complete than four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The time taken to return to normal activity was one day shorter and time taken to return to work two days shorter in the fewer-than-four-ports group compared with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> There was no significant difference in the cosmetic appearance between the two groups at 6 to 12 months after surgery.
<ABS> There appears to be no advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of decreasing surgical complications, hospital stay, or in improving quality of life and cosmetic appearance.
<ABS> In contrast, the safety of fewer-than-four port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is yet to be established.
<ABS> Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy cannot be recommended routinely outside well-designed clinical trials.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions because of the way that the trial was conducted.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials (which have low probability to arrive at wrong conclusions because of chance and because of participant or researcher prejudice) are necessary to determine whether fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe and whether there is any advantage of fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy over four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Traditionally, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using two 10-mm ports and two 5-mm ports.
<INT> Recently, a reduction in the number of ports has been suggested as a modification of the standard technique with a view to decreasing pain and improving cosmesis.
<INT> The safety and effectiveness of using fewer-than-four ports has not yet been established.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted the data.
<MaM> We analysed the data using both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis, whenever possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found nine trials with 855 participants that randomised participants to fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 427) versus four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 428).
<RES> Most trials included low anaesthetic risk participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> Seven of the nine trials used a single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the remaining two trials used three-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the experimental intervention.
<RES> Only one trial including 70 participants had low risk of bias.
<RES> Fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be completed successfully in more than 90% of participants in most trials.
<RES> The remaining participants were mostly converted to four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy but some participants had to undergo open cholecystectomy.
<RES> There was no mortality in either group in the seven trials that reported mortality (318 participants in fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 316 participants in four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group).
<RES> The proportion of participants with serious adverse events was low in both treatment groups and the estimated RR was compatible with a reduction and substantial increased risk with the fewer-than-four-ports group (6/318 (1.9%)) and four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (0/316 (0%)) (RR 3.93; 95% CI 0.86 to 18.04; 7 trials; 634 participants; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The estimated difference in the quality of life (measured between 10 and 30 days) was imprecise (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.18; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.42; 4 trials; 510 participants; very low quality evidence), as was the proportion of participants in whom the laparoscopic cholecystectomy had to be converted to open cholecystectomy between the groups (fewer-than-four ports 3/289 (adjusted proportion 1.2%) versus four port: 5/292 (1.7%); RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.19 to 2.35; 5 trials; 581 participants; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy took 14 minutes longer to complete (MD 14.44 minutes; 95% CI 5.95 to 22.93; 9 trials; 855 participants; very low quality evidence).
<RES> There was no clear difference in hospital stay between the groups (MD -0.01 days; 95% CI -0.28 to 0.26; 6 trials; 731 participants) or in the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.22; 1 trial; 50 participants; very low quality evidence) between the two groups.
<RES> The times taken to return to normal activity and work were shorter by two days in the fewer-than-four-ports group compared with four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (return to normal activity: MD -1.20 days; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.81; 2 trials; 325 participants; very low quality evidence; return to work: MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -3.31 to -0.69; 1 trial; 150 participants; very low quality evidence).
<RES> There was no significant difference in cosmesis scores at 6 to 12 months between the two groups (SMD 0.37; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.84; 2 trials; 317 participants; very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The safety profile of using fewer-than-four ports is yet to be established and fewer-than-four-ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be reserved for well-designed randomised clinical trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A broken collarbone (clavicle fracture) is a common injury, particularly in adolescents, and account for up to 4% of all fractures.
<ABS> The most common treatments are the use of an arm sling, strapping, figure-of-eight bandages and splints.
<ABS> This review aimed to evaluate the effects of different methods (including duration of immobilisation) for treating collarbone fractures in adolescents and adults without surgery.
<ABS> The main outcomes we were interested in were pain and long-term function.
<ABS> We searched the scientific literature up to 29 January 2014 and found three relevant studies with a total of 354 participants.
<ABS> Two trials compared the figure-of-eight bandage versus an arm sling.
<ABS> One trial found slightly higher pain scores at 15 days in the bandage group and the other trial reported more discomfort during bandage use.
<ABS> Neither trial detected differences in other and longer-term outcomes.
<ABS> This evidence was very low quality and so we cannot rely on it to draw conclusions about how collarbone fractures should be treated.
<ABS> The third trial compared therapeutic ultrasound with placebo (sham) in 120 people with clavicle fractures.
<ABS> We considered this evidence to be of moderate quality as the study was well conducted but it was not big enough to be conclusive.
<ABS> It found no difference in outcome, including the time for fracture healing, between the two groups.
<ABS> Overall, there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about the best methods of non-surgical treatment for these fractures.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Clavicle (collarbone) fractures account for around 4% of all fractures; treatment of these fractures is usually non-surgical (conservative).
<INT> Commonly used treatments are arm slings, strapping, figure-of-eight bandages and splints.
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), LILACS (from 1982), trial registers, orthopaedic proceedings and reference lists of articles.
<MaM> We applied no language or publication restrictions.
<MaM> The date of the last search was 29 January 2014.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The primary outcomes were shoulder function or disability, pain and treatment failure.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two authors selected eligible trials, independently assessed risk of bias and cross-checked data extraction.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous variables, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for continuous variables.
<MaM> There was no pooling of data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three trials in this review with 354 participants.
<RES> No new trials were included in this update.
<RES> Very low quality evidence was available from two trials (234 participants) that compared the figure-of-eight bandage with an arm sling for treating acute middle third clavicle fractures.
<RES> Both trials were underpowered and compromised by poor methodology.
<RES> One trial found slightly higher pain levels in the bandage group at 15 days (mean difference 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 1.26; visual analogue scale: 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain)); and the other trial reported greater discomfort during bandage wear.
<RES> There were no significant differences between the two interventions in functional or other outcomes reported for either trial.
<RES> Moderate quality evidence was available from the third trial (120 participants), which evaluated therapeutic ultrasound.
<RES> This trial was at low risk of any type of bias but was underpowered.
<RES> The trial found no statistically significant difference between low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and placebo in the time to clinical fracture healing (mean difference -0.32 days, 95% CI -5.85 to 5.21 days), nor in any of the other reported outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further research is warranted.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that is often treated with carbamazepine.
<ABS> With treatment, the number of seizures are often reduced but many people experience side effects.
<ABS> When carbamazepine is taken and it is absorbed into the body quickly there is a sharp rise in blood levels.
<ABS> These 'peaks' may be associated with side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness and lack of coordination.
<ABS> A form of carbamazepine that releases the medication into the body slowly may reduce these 'peaks' in blood levels, reducing the occurrence of side effects.
<ABS> This review compared studies assessing the differences between a 'fast-release' carbamazepine and a 'slow-release' carbamazepine.
<ABS> Just one of 10 studies found a significant difference between the two carbamazepine types in the number of seizures experienced, with patients prescribed the slow-release carbamazepine experiencing fewer seizures than patients prescribed the fast-release drug.
<ABS> Patients taking 'slow-release' carbamazepine tended to experience fewer side effects.
<ABS> It must be stressed that there are few studies assessing the differences between these two carbamazepine types and more studies are needed before we can make a definitive conclusion.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is defined as the tendency to spontaneous, excessive neuronal discharge manifesting as seizures.
<INT> It is a common disorder with an incidence of 50 per 100,000 per year and a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% (Hauser 1993) in the developed world.
<INT> Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a widely used antiepileptic drug that is associated with a number of troublesome adverse events including dizziness, double vision and unsteadiness.
<INT> These often occur during peaks in plasma concentration.
<INT> The occurrence of such adverse events may limit the daily dose that can be tolerated and reduce the chances of seizure control for patients requiring higher doses (Vojvodic 2002).
<INT> A controlled-release formulation of carbamazepine delivers the same dose over a longer period of time when compared to a standard formulation, thereby reducing post-dose peaks and potentially reducing adverse events associated with peak plasma levels.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the efficacy of immediate-release CBZ (IR CBZ) versus controlled-release CBZ (CR CBZ) in patients diagnosed with epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The methodological quality of each study was assessed with respect to study design, type of control, method and the concealment of allocation, blinding and completeness of follow up, and the presence of blinding for assessment of non-fatal outcomes.
<MaM> We did not make use of an overall quality score.
<MaM> Two review authors (GP, MS) independently extracted the data and recorded relevant information on a standardised data extraction form.
<MaM> Results were assessed for inclusion.
<MaM> The heterogeneity of the included trials resulted in only a narrative, descriptive analysis being possible for both the categorical and time-to-event data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this review.
<RES> One trial included patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and nine included patients on treatment with IR CBZ.
<RES> Eight trials reported heterogeneous measures of seizure frequency with conflicting results.
<RES> A statistically significant difference was observed in only one trial, with patients prescribed CR CBZ experiencing fewer seizures than patients prescribed IR CBZ.
<RES> Nine trials reported measures of adverse events.
<RES> There was a trend in favour of CR CBZ with four trials reporting a statistically significant reduction in adverse events compared to IR CBZ.
<RES> A further two trials reported fewer adverse events with CR CBZ but the reduction was not statistically significant.
<RES> One trial found no difference, with a further trial reporting increased adverse events in the CR CBZ group although not statistically significant.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> For trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed IR CBZ, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of CR CBZ with respect to seizure frequency.
<CON> There is a trend for CR CBZ to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to IR CBZ.
<CON> A change to CR CBZ may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on IR CBZ but experiencing unacceptable adverse events.
<CON> The included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion.
<CON> Randomised controlled trials comparing CR CBZ to IR CBZ and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of CBZ preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy.
<ABS> Having GDM increases the risk of complications during the rest of the pregnancy for the mother and her baby.
<ABS> Women with GDM are more likely to develop pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) and require a caesarean section.
<ABS> For the baby, potential problems include the baby growing larger than it normally would, causing difficulties with birth.
<ABS> The baby can also have low blood sugar levels after birth.
<ABS> Although GDM usually resolves following birth, both mother and child are at risk of developing type II diabetes in the future.
<ABS> There is strong evidence that treating GDM is beneficial and improves health outcomes.
<ABS> It may therefore help if pregnant women are screened to identify as many as possible of those who do have GDM before they have symptoms, such as excessive thirst or urination, or fatigue.
<ABS> The two main approaches to screening are 'universal' where all women undergo a screening test for GDM; and 'selective' where only those women at 'high risk' are screened.
<ABS> The main risk factors are maternal age, high body mass index, family history and cigarette smoking.
<ABS> The different screening strategies used around the world to identify women with GDM include identifying women based on their risk factors, a blood sugar test one hour after a 50 g glucose drink, and random blood sugar measurements.
<ABS> It is however unclear whether screening for GDM leads to better health outcomes and if so, which screening strategy is the most appropriate.
<ABS> This review included four trials involving 3972 women and their babies, and found that there is little high-quality evidence on the effects of screening for GDM on health outcomes for mothers and their babies.
<ABS> One trial compared risk factor screening with universal screening, and three trials evaluated different methods of administering a 50 g glucose load (the glucose load is used during the screening test).
<ABS> In one trial, women who were in the universal screening group were more likely to be diagnosed with GDM compared with women in the high-risk screening group.
<ABS> However, this trial was not of high quality.
<ABS> Few other differences between groups were shown in any of the trials.
<ABS> Further research is required to see which recommendations for screening practices for GDM are most appropriate.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy.
<INT> Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mother and baby both perinatally and in the long term.
<INT> There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different methods of screening for GDM.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials involving 3972 women in the review.
<RES> One quasi-randomised trial compared risk factor screening with universal or routine screening by 50 g oral glucose challenge testing.
<RES> Women in the universal screening group were more likely to be diagnosed with GDM (one trial, 3152 women, risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.75).
<RES> This trial did not report on the other primary outcomes of the review (positive screen for GDM, mode of birth, large-for-gestational age, or macrosomia).
<RES> Considering secondary outcomes, infants of mothers in the risk factor screening group were born marginally earlier than infants of mothers in the routine screening group (one trial, 3152 women, mean difference (MD) -0.15 weeks, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.03).
<RES> The remaining three trials evaluated different methods of administering a 50 g glucose load.
<RES> Two small trials compared glucose monomer with glucose polymer testing, with one of these trials including a candy bar group.
<RES> One trial compared a glucose solution with food.
<RES> No differences in diagnosis of GDM were found between each comparison.
<RES> However, in one trial significantly more women in the glucose monomer group screened positive for GDM than women in the candy bar group (80 women, RR 3.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 11.57).
<RES> The three trials did not report on the primary review outcomes of mode of birth, large-for-gestational age or macrosomia.
<RES> Overall, women drinking the glucose monomer experienced fewer side effects from testing than women drinking the glucose polymer (two trials, 151 women, RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 7.13).
<RES> However, we observed substantial heterogeneity between the trials for this result (I² = 61%).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question
<ABS> We wanted to assess the effectiveness of training, exercises or other interventions aimed at helping people who have had a stroke stand up independently from a sitting position, compared with usual care or no intervention.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Rising to stand from sitting is one of the most frequently performed tasks of daily living and is something people need to be able to do to start walking.
<ABS> After a stroke, people may have difficulty rising to stand from sitting.
<ABS> This review looked at the effect of training or exercises on ability to rise to stand, and also aimed to look at the effect of different chair positions that might help people rise to stand.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 13 studies up to June 2013.
<ABS> These studies included 603 participants who had had a stroke.
<ABS> Twelve of the studies investigated the effect of different types of training or exercise: six studies (276 participants) investigated repetitive sit-to-stand training, four studies (264 participants) investigated an exercise training programme that included sit-to-stand training, one study (12 participants) included a training programme (sitting training) aiming to improve sit-to-stand, and one study (42 participants) investigated feedback (information about the symmetry of weight taken through the feet) during sit-to-stand.
<ABS> One of the studies investigated the effect of starting posture for sit-to-stand: this study (nine participants) compared sit-to-stand with a cane and without a cane.
<ABS> This study measured people during three tests of rising to stand with a cane, and three tests of rising to stand without a cane; there was no training period.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Combining the results of these studies provides us with evidence that training or exercises aiming to improve sit-to-stand performance have beneficial effects compared with usual care, no treatment or an alternative intervention: people who participated in training or exercises got faster at rising to stand and increased the amount of weight that they took through the leg affected by the stroke.
<ABS> There was also some evidence that these beneficial effects were still present several months after the end of training.
<ABS> Sit-to-stand training did not seem to affect the number of falls that people had, although the evidence was of poor quality.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence to say what the ideal amount of training or exercise was, but the results do suggest that training three times a week for two to three weeks may be enough to have a beneficial effect.
<ABS> We did not find any evidence of effects on outcomes other than time to sit-to-stand or the weight through the affected leg, or any evidence that the length of the training programme or the time since the participants had their stroke made any difference to outcomes.
<ABS> The studies that we found mainly included people who were able to walk and sit-to-stand independently at the start of the study, so these results are only relevant to this group of people.
<ABS> In other words, these results are not relevant to people who are unable to sit-to-stand independently and further research is needed to investigate the effect of sit-to-stand training for these people.
<ABS> The available studies suggest that effective interventions can either be specific repetitive training of sit-to-stand or exercise programmes that include repetitive sit-to-stand.
<ABS> The evidence is insufficient to reach conclusions relating to the duration or intensity of training.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions.
<ABS> However, we found moderate quality evidence, from a relatively low number of small studies, that interventions to improve sit-to-stand may have a beneficial effect on the speed of rising to stand and the weight taken through the affected leg.
<ABS> We found insufficient evidence to reach any conclusions about the effect of sit-to-stand training on other outcomes.
<ABS> We recommend large clinical trials to confirm the results of this review, and to investigate the effects of different numbers of repetitions and durations of therapy.
<ABS> Future studies should include a measure of functional ability, and should measure long-term outcomes as well as outcomes straight after therapy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Following stroke, patients can experience a number of problems relating to the ability to sit-to-stand independently.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving sit-to-stand ability after stroke.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched reference lists and trials registers and contacted experts.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The primary outcome of interest was the ability to sit-to-stand independently.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included time taken to sit-to-stand, measures of lateral symmetry during sit-to-stand, incidence of falls and general functional ability scores.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened abstracts, extracted data and appraised trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirteen studies (603 participants) met the inclusion criteria for this review, and data from 11 of these studies were included within meta-analyses.
<RES> Twelve of the 13 included studies investigated rehabilitation interventions; one (nine participants) investigated the effect of altered starting posture for sit-to-stand.
<RES> We judged only four studies to be at low risk of bias for all methodological parameters assessed.
<RES> The majority of randomised controlled trials included participants who were already able to sit-to-stand or walk independently.
<RES> Only one study (48 participants), which we judged to be at high risk of bias, reported our primary outcome of interest, ability to sit-to-stand independently, and found that training increased the odds of achieving independent sit-to-stand compared with control (odds ratio (OR) 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 16.50, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Interventions or training for sit-to-stand improved the time taken to sit-to-stand and the lateral symmetry (weight distribution between the legs) during sit-to-stand (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.06, seven studies, 335 participants; and SMD 0.85; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.33, five studies, 105 participants respectively, both moderate quality evidence).
<RES> These improvements are maintained at long-term follow-up.
<RES> Few trials assessing the effect of sit-to-stand training on peak vertical ground reaction force (one study, 54 participants) and functional ability (two studies, 196 participants) were identified, providing very low and low quality evidence respectively.
<RES> The effect of sit-to-stand training on number of falls was imprecise, demonstrating no benefit or harm (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, five studies, 319 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> We judged the majority of studies that assessed falls to be at high risk of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review has found insufficient evidence relating to our primary outcome of ability to sit-to-stand independently to reach any generalisable conclusions.
<CON> There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions relating to the effect of interventions to improve sit-to-stand on peak vertical ground reaction force, functional ability and falls.
<CON> This review adds to a growing body of evidence that repetitive task-specific training is beneficial for outcomes in people receiving rehabilitation following stroke.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Babies born prematurely (at less than 37 weeks gestation) or with a low birth weight (less than 2500 grams) have special feeding requirements.
<ABS> Preterm babies are often fed with formula milk because breast milk is not always available.
<ABS> The provision of artificial feeds varies considerably in preterm babies and there is concern that introducing full strength formulas too early may lead to the retention of feed in the stomach which is associated with feeding intolerance and the severe bowel disorder, necrotising enterocolitis.
<ABS> This review looked at whether dilute formula milk is more effective than full strength formula milk in the initial feeding of preterm babies.
<ABS> The evidence for this review is current up to February 2013.
<ABS> Three studies were included in the review, one small, low-quality trial in 50 preterm infants; a second small, moderate quality trial in 38 preterm infants and a third very small trial of unclear quality in 14 preterm infants.
<ABS> The trials found that infants receiving dilute formula achieved full energy intake earlier than infants receiving full strength formula (20 kcal/oz) and experienced fewer episodes of feeding intolerance.
<ABS> A lack of data on other important outcomes, such as the incidence of necrotising enterocolitis and weight gain, limits the usefulness of the studies and highlights areas that need to be addressed in future trials.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Preterm infants have fewer nutrient reserves at birth than full term infants and often receive artificial formula feeds in the absence of expressed breast milk.
<INT> This review focuses on whether dilute or full strength formula is the preferable mode of introducing feeds in preterm infants.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> A secondary objective was to assess the effects of different dilution strategies.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We used the standard search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.
<MaM> This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013) and EMBASE (1974 to February 2013).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies were excluded if infants received formula as a supplement to breast milk.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We independently assessed studies for inclusion.
<MaM> We synthesised mean differences using a fixed-effect meta-analysis model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three studies involving 102 preterm or low birth weight infants were included in the review.
<RES> The studies compared dilute (double volume, half strength) formula with full strength (20 kcal/oz) formula.
<RES> We assessed all three studies as being at unclear risk of bias due to the likely absence of blinding of study personnel and the potential for selection bias in the largest trial.
<RES> Data for the primary outcome of necrotising enterocolitis were not reported in any of the studies.
<RES> Two of the studies (88 infants) could be combined in the meta-analysis.
<RES> For the secondary outcomes, infants in the dilute formula with double volume (half strength) group attained an adequate energy intake significantly earlier than infants in the full strength group (two studies, MD -2.26, 95% CI -2.85 to -1.67).
<RES> For weight gain one week after commencement of intragastric feeds, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (one study, MD 0.05 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.15).
<RES> Data were not reported for length of hospital stay.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was no evidence of important differences in feeding intolerance.
<CON> The impact on serious gastrointestinal problems, including necrotising enterocolitis, was not reported.
<CON> Further randomised trials are needed to confirm these results.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cataract, a cloudy lens within the eye, is a major complication in people with uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye).
<ABS> Different types of artificial lenses (intraocular lenses, IOLs) are available to insert into the eye after removal of the cloudy natural lens during cataract surgery.
<ABS> The purpose of this review is to summarize the effects of different artificial lenses in adults with uveitis.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature up to August 2013 and identified four randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) containing 216 participants investigating different lens types.
<ABS> Lens materials studied were acrylic, silicone, heparin surface modified, and poly(methyl methacrylate).
<ABS> The trials included participants with different causes of uveitis, compared different lens types, and reported different outcomes.
<ABS> Due to these differences across trials, no meta-analysis (pooling of trial data) was performed.
<ABS> The largest trial (140 participants) was funded by a professional society.
<ABS> The other three trials did not report their funding sources.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is very limited evidence on which to determine the effects of different types of lens materials for people with uveitis.
<ABS> The results from the largest trial provide only preliminary evidence that acrylic lenses may perform better than silicone lenses in terms of improving vision and reducing the chances of post-surgical inflammation and complications.
<ABS> At this time, there is not enough data to conclude whether additional types of lenses are preferable to other types.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Because the trials included small numbers of participants in each of the four lens-type groups, there is uncertainty in the results of the studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cataract formation often occurs in people with uveitis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2013), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to August 2013), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en).
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 14 August 2013.
<MaM> We also performed forward and backward searching using the Science Citation Index and the reference lists of the included studies, respectively, in August 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Two review authors screened the search results and for included studies, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data independently.
<MaM> We contacted study investigators for additional information.
<MaM> We did not perform a meta-analysis due to variability in reporting and follow-up intervals for the primary and secondary outcomes of interest.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs involving 216 participants (range of 2 to 140 participants with uveitic cataract per trial) and comparing up to four types of IOLs.
<RES> The largest study was an international study with centers in Brazil, Egypt, Finland, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the USA; two studies were conducted in Germany and one in Saudi Arabia.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity with respect to the ages of participants and etiologies of uveitis within and across studies.
<RES> The length of follow-up among the studies ranged from 1 to 24 months after cataract surgery.
<RES> The studies were at low risk of selection bias, but two of the four studies did not employ masking and only one study included all randomized participants in the final analyses.
<RES> The funding source was disclosed by investigators of the largest study (professional society) and not reported by the other three.
<RES> Due to heterogeneity in lens types evaluated and outcomes reported among the trials, we did not combine data in a meta-analysis.
<RES> In the largest study (140 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive one of four types of IOLs: hydrophobic acrylic, silicone, HSM PMMA, or unmodified PMMA.
<RES> Proportions of participants with one or more Snellen lines of visual improvement were similar among the four treatment groups at one year' follow-up: 45 of 48 (94%) in the hydrophobic acrylic IOL group, 39 of 44 (89%) in the silicone IOL group, 18 of 22 (82%) in the HSM PMMA IOL group, and 22 of 26 (85%) in the unmodified PMMA IOL group.
<RES> When comparing hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with silicone IOLs, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.20).
<RES> At one year' follow-up, fewer eyes randomized to hydrophobic acrylic IOLs developed posterior synechiae when compared with eyes receiving silicone IOLs (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.79); the effects between these groups were less certain with respect to developing posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.37), corneal edema (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.12), cystoid macular edema (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.84), or mild IOL decentration (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.22).
<RES> Two intra-individual studies also compared HSM PMMA IOLs with unmodified PMMA IOLs at three or six months of follow-up.
<RES> These studies, including a combined total of 16 participants with uveitis, were insufficiently powered to detect differences in outcomes among eyes of people with uveitis randomized to receive HSM PMMA IOLs when compared with fellow eyes receiving unmodified PMMA IOLs.
<RES> In the fourth study (60 participants), the study eye of each participant was randomized to receive a hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOL.
<RES> At three months, there were no statistical or clinical differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOL types in the proportions of participants with two or more Snellen lines of visual improvement (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.22).
<RES> There were similar rates in the development of PCO between hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOLs at six months' follow-up (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25).
<RES> The effect of the lenses on posterior synechiae was uncertain at six months' follow-up (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.22).
<RES> None of the included studies reported quality of life outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Based on the trials identified in this review, there is uncertainty as to which type of IOL provides the best visual and clinical outcomes in people with uveitis undergoing cataract surgery.
<CON> The studies were small, not all lens materials were compared in all studies, and not all lens materials were available in all study sites.
<CON> Evidence of a superior effect of hydrophobic acrylic lenses over silicone lenses, specifically for posterior synechiae outcomes comes from a single study at a high risk of performance and detection bias.
<CON> However, due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity in outcome reporting, we found insufficient information to assess these and other types of IOL materials for cataract surgery for eyes with uveitis.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Vitamin D supplementation for cystic fibrosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The use of regular vitamin D preparations for children and adults with cystic fibrosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis with pancreatic insufficiency can mean that fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D, are poorly absorbed.
<ABS> This can lead to vitamin deficiencies.
<ABS> Lack of vitamin D (vitamin D deficiency) can cause specific problems such as bone deformity and bone fractures.
<ABS> It may also be associated with poorer general and respiratory health.
<ABS> Therefore, people with cystic fibrosis are usually given regular vitamin D preparations from a very young age.
<ABS> However, excess vitamin D can also cause respiratory problems and problems with high calcium levels.
<ABS> The review contains six studies, however we could only analyse data from three of these studies.
<ABS> Three studies were only published as conference abstracts.
<ABS> The included studies varied greatly in quality, the amount of vitamin D administered, the duration of treatment and the outcomes that were measured.
<ABS> Three studies were in children and adolescents and three in adults.
<ABS> Few outcome data could be combined.
<ABS> We are unable to draw any conclusions about giving routine vitamin D supplements and recommend that, until more evidence is available, local guidelines are followed regarding this practice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder with multiorgan effects.
<INT> In a subgroup with pancreatic insufficiency malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) may occur.
<INT> Vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralisation and may have extraskeletal effects.
<INT> This review examines the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of the most recent search: 08 July 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies (239 participants) are included, although only three studies provided data from 69 adults and children with cystic fibrosis for analysis.
<RES> One study compared a single high dose of vitamin D (250,000 IU) to placebo at the time of hospital admission with a respiratory exacerbation in 30 pancreatic insufficient adults with cystic fibrosis.
<RES> The second study compared supplemental 800 international units (IU) vitamin D and placebo for 12 months in 30 osteopenic pancreatic insufficient adults; both groups continued 900 IU vitamin D daily.
<RES> The third study compared supplemental 1 g calcium alone, 1600 IU vitamin D alone, 1600 IU vitamin D and 1 g calcium and placebo in a double-blind randomised cross-over study; only nine children who completed both vitamin D and placebo groups after six-months supplementation and a three-month washout period are included; pancreatic sufficiency or disease status of participants are not defined.
<RES> The studies are not directly comparable due to differences in supplementation, outcome reporting and possibly participant characteristics (e.g. severity of lung disease, growth and nutrition, pancreatic sufficiency).
<RES> The only outcome for which we could combine data from more than two studies was 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels; patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had significantly higher levels, mean difference 7.24 ng/ml (95% confidence interval 5.01 to 9.46).
<RES> However, ironically one study reported 1,25(OH)2D with levels significantly favouring the placebo group, mean difference -30.30 pmol/ml (95% confidence interval -59.89 to -0.71).
<RES> Bone mineral density was measured in two studies; both described no significant change between groups.
<RES> There were no adverse events in any study.
<RES> The remaining three studies are published as abstracts only and did not provide data for analysis.
<RES> These abstracts include: a report of pre-intervention data in a study comparing daily calcitriol (0.25 or 0.5 micrograms) with placebo in pancreatic insufficient children and young adults; an interim report of a double-blind randomised control study comparing 5000 IU vitamin D daily for 12 weeks during winter in 67 adult cystic fibrosis patients; and a comparison of the effect of three months of vitamin D supplementation (dose not specified) with placebo on bone mineral density in 42 children with cystic fibrosis and low bone mineral density.
<RES> Risk of bias was highly variable between all studies.
<RES> Only one study had a low risk of bias for the five main criteria (random sequence generation, allocation, blinding, attrition and reporting).
<RES> The rest of the studies had unclear or high risks of bias.
<RES> Two studies had a low risk of bias for blinding and another two studies for attrition bias.
<RES> In the studies published as abstracts, assessment of the risks of bias was uncertain in many aspects.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In patients receiving vitamin D supplementation, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are significantly higher.
<CON> However, there is no evidence of clinical benefit or harm in the limited number of small-sized published studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> It frequently causes sudden, painless vision loss in one eye, although sometimes the vision loss may be minimal.
<ABS> If the vein blockage leads to inadequate oxygen delivery to the sensitive retinal tissue, the CRVO is the 'non-perfused' or 'ischaemic' subtype.
<ABS> More commonly, blood flow and oxygen delivery are restored following the vein blockage and the CRVO is the 'perfused' or 'non-ischaemic' subtype, and has a better visual outcome.
<ABS> Various other complications may develop over hours, days, weeks or months.
<ABS> These include macular oedema, in which fluid collects within the retina and causes reduction in vision.
<ABS> Until relatively recently there has been no evidence-based treatment for this condition.
<ABS> Anti-VEGF agents have been used successfully to treat patients with other retinal vascular disorders, including several conditions associated with macular oedema.
<ABS> The trials compared sham injections with one of four types of anti-VEGF agents: aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye, Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin), pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) and ranibizumab (Lucentis).
<ABS> All trials treated participants for at least six months.
<ABS> Three trials were multicentre, international trials and three were conducted in Norway, Sweden or the USA.
<ABS> Furthermore, the risk of losing significant vision (at least 3 lines on the vision chart) was reduced by 80% in those receiving anti-VEGF therapy compared to those receiving no treatment.
<ABS> No significant safety concerns were identified at six or 12 months, but the available studies do not allow a conclusion about their long-term effectiveness and safety to be drawn.
<ABS> Nevertheless, the availability of anti-VEGF treatment for CRVO macular oedema represents an important advance in the clinical management options for this sight-threatening disease.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> There were no language or date restrictions in the electronic search for trials.
<MaM> The electronic databases and clinical trials registers were last searched on 29th October 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intravitreal anti-VEGF agents of any dose or duration to sham injection or no treatment.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Where available, we also presented quality of life and economic data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found six RCTs that met the inclusion criteria after independent and duplicate review of the search results.
<RES> These RCTs included 937 participants and compared outcomes at six months to sham injection for four anti-VEGF agents: aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye, Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin), pegaptanib sodium (Macugen) and ranibizumab (Lucentis).
<RES> Three trials were conducted in Norway, Sweden and the USA, and three trials were multicentre, one including centres in the USA, Canada, India, Israel, Argentina and Columbia, a second including centres in the USA, Australia, France, Germany, Israel, and Spain, and a third including centres in Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Australia, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.
<RES> We performed meta-analysis on three key visual outcomes, using data from up to six trials.
<RES> High-quality evidence from six trials revealed that participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment were 2.71 times more likely to gain at least 15 letters of visual acuity at six months compared to participants treated with sham injections (risk ratio (RR) 2.71; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.10 to 3.49).
<RES> High-quality evidence from five trials suggested anti-VEGF treatment was associated with an 80% lower risk of losing at least 15 letters of visual acuity at six months compared to sham injection (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.34).
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence from three trials (481 participants) revealed that the mean reduction from baseline to six months in central retinal thickness was 267.4 µm (95% CI 211.4 µm to 323.4 µm) greater in participants treated with anti-VEGF than in participants treated with sham.
<RES> The meta-analyses demonstrate that treatment with anti-VEGF is associated with a clinically meaningful gain in vision at six months.
<RES> One trial demonstrated sustained benefit at 12 months compared to sham.
<RES> No significant ocular or systemic safety concerns were identified in this time period.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Compared to no treatment, repeated intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents in eyes with CRVO macular oedema improved visual outcomes at six months.
<CON> All agents were relatively well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse effects in the short term.
<CON> Future trials should address the relative efficacy and safety of the anti-VEGF agents and other treatments, including intravitreal corticosteroids, for longer-term outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Some degree of kidney failure affects about 15% to 25% of people and is a silent disease that creeps up on an individual with symptoms and signs developing only very late.
<ABS> When kidney failure becomes end-stage, life supporting therapy in the form of dialysis or transplantation is the only option available for the patient.
<ABS> This form of therapy is very expensive and highly intrusive into the patients' life.
<ABS> Measures to prevent progression to this terminal stage are of great importance to prevent this catastrophe.
<ABS> Our analyses of 40 studies of people with chronic kidney disease shows that people referred earlier to a specialist kidney doctor lived longer.
<ABS> Death rates in people referred early were about half of those referred late and these benefits were seen as early as three months and lasted for at least five years.
<ABS> People referred early also spent less time in hospital and were better prepared for dialysis.
<ABS> Dialysis first requires surgical placement of a fistula and early referral to specialist services often means better preparation, a lower risk of infection and other complications.
<ABS> We did not discover any adverse effects from early specialist referral.
<ABS> Randomised controlled trials provide the most reliable information of all study designs, so it should be noted that all 40 studies analysed for this review used a cohort design.
<ABS> Cohort studies are the next best level of evidence and the only available evidence.
<ABS> For ethical reasons it is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial that deliberately assigns patients to late specialist referral will ever be conducted.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> SF-36 and KDQoL are validated measurement instruments for kidney diseases.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2012; Issue 1) which contains the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to February 2012), EMBASE (1980 to February 2012).
<MaM> Search terms were approved by the Trial Search Co-ordinator.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No RCTs or quasi-RCTs were identified.
<RES> There were 40 longitudinal cohort studies providing data on 63,887 participants; 43,209 (68%) who were referred early and 20,678 (32%) referred late.
<RES> Comparative mortality was higher in patients referred to specialist services late versus those referred early.
<RES> Risk ratios (RR) for mortality reductions in patients referred early were evident at three months (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.67; I² = 84%) and remained at five years (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.71; I² = 87%).
<RES> Initial hospitalisation was 9.12 days shorter with early referral (95% CI -10.92 to -7.32 days; I² = 82%) compared to late referral.
<RES> Pooled analysis showed patients referred early were more likely than late referrals to initiate RRT with peritoneal dialysis (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.64 to 1.84; I² = 92%).
<RES> Patients referred early were less likely to receive temporary vascular access (RR 0.47, 95% CL 0.45 to 0.50; I² = 97%) than those referred late.
<RES> Patients referred early were more likely to receive permanent vascular access (RR 3.22, 95% CI 2.92 to 3.55; I² = 97%).
<RES> Systolic blood pressure (BP) was significantly lower in early versus late referrals (MD -3.09 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.23 to -0.95; I² = 85%); diastolic BP was significantly lower in early versus late referrals (MD -1.64 mm Hg, 95% CI -2.77 to -0.51; I² = 82%).
<RES> Diabetes prevalence was similar in patients referred early and late (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; I² = 87%) as was ischaemic heart disease (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13; I² = 74%), peripheral vascular disease (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17; I² = 90%), and congestive heart failure (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15; I² = 92%).
<RES> Inability to walk was less prevalent in early referrals (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86).
<RES> Prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was similar in those referred early and late (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.14; I² = 94%) as was cerebrovascular disease (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; I² = 83%).
<RES> The quality of the included studies was assessed as being low to moderate based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
<RES> Slight differences in the definition of early versus late referral infer some risk of bias.
<RES> Generally, heterogeneity in most of the analyses was high.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Differences in mortality and hospitalisation data between the two groups were not explained by differences in prevalence of comorbid disease or serum phosphate.
<CON> However, early referral was associated with better preparation and placement of dialysis access.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones.
<ABS> Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year.
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone.
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole incision, also known as a port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered less painful than open surgery, pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) into the tummy (abdomen) may be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the benefits and harms of intra-abdominal administration of local anaesthetics is unknown.
<ABS> We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials with regards to benefits and other comparative study designs for treatment-related harms.
<ABS> When conducted correctly, randomised clinical studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment.
<ABS> Two review authors searched the literature and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 58 trials, of which 48 randomised clinical trials involving 2849 people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy contributed data to one or more of the outcomes.
<ABS> Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The choice of whether the participants received local anaesthetic agents (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in people who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in eight trials (446 participants) that reported deaths.
<ABS> The studies reported very few or no serious complications in the groups.
<ABS> There were no local anaesthetic-related complications in nearly 1000 participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in the different trials that reported complications.
<ABS> None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work.
<ABS> The small differences in hospital stay between the two groups were imprecise.
<ABS> Pain scores were lower in the participants who received intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration compared with those who received controls at four to eight hours and at nine to 24 hours as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10).
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that means that there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the study was conducted.
<ABS> Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Serious adverse event rates were low in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> There is very low quality evidence that local anaesthetic intra-abdominal administration reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is likely to be small.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary.
<ABS> Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The safety and effectiveness of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors collected the data independently.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 58 trials, of which 48 trials with 2849 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (1558 participants) versus control (1291 participants) contributed data to one or more of the outcomes.
<RES> All the trials except one trial with 30 participants were at high risk of bias.
<RES> Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> Various intraperitoneal local anaesthetic agents were used but bupivacaine in the liquid form was the most common local anaesthetic used.
<RES> There were considerable differences in the methods of local anaesthetic instillation including the location (subdiaphragmatic, gallbladder bed, or both locations) and timing (before or after the removal of gallbladder) between the trials.
<RES> There was no mortality in either group in the eight trials that reported mortality (0/236 (0%) in local anaesthetic instillation versus 0/210 (0%) in control group; very low quality evidence).
<RES> One participant experienced the outcome of serious morbidity (eight trials; 446 participants; 1/236 (0.4%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 0/210 (0%) in the control group; RR 3.00; 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; very low quality evidence).
<RES> Although the remaining trials did not report the overall morbidity, three trials (190 participants) reported that there were no intra-operative complications.
<RES> Twenty trials reported that there were no serious adverse events in any of the 715 participants who received local anaesthetic instillation.
<RES> None of the trials reported participant quality of life, return to normal activity, or return to work.
<RES> The effect of local anaesthetic instillation on the proportion of participants discharged as day surgery between the two groups was imprecise and compatible with benefit and no difference of intervention (three trials; 242 participants; 89/160 (adjusted proportion 61.0%) in local anaesthetic instillation group versus 40/82 (48.8%) in control group; RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.58; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The MD in length of hospital stay was 0.04 days (95% CI -0.23 to 0.32; five trials; 335 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> The pain scores as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) were significantly lower in the local anaesthetic instillation group than the control group at four to eight hours (32 trials; 2020 participants; MD -0.99 cm; 95% CI -1.10 to -0.88 on a VAS scale of 0 to 10 cm; very low quality evidence) and at nine to 24 hours (29 trials; 1787 participants; MD -0.53 cm; 95% CI -0.62 to -0.44; very low quality evidence).
<RES> Various subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to investigate the influence of the different local anaesthetic agents, different methods of local anaesthetic instillation, and different controls on the effectiveness of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation were inconsistent.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Serious adverse events were rare in studies evaluating local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation (very low quality evidence).
<CON> There is very low quality evidence that it reduces pain in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> However, the clinical importance of this reduction in pain is unknown and likely to be small.
<CON> Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Prophylactic antibiotics for penetrating abdominal trauma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> For over half a century antibiotics have been given to patients that have suffered from a penetrating injury to the abdominal peritoneal cavity in an attempt to decrease the incidence of post-operative wound infection, intra-abdominal infection and mortality.
<ABS> This review was designed to assess whether or not this practice is supported by medical evidence.
<ABS> No randomised controlled trials could be found that met the inclusion criteria for this review.
<ABS> Therefore, there is no evidence to unequivocally support or refute this practice.
<ABS> Current guidelines are based on expert opinion rather than fact.
<ABS> We recommend that a randomised controlled trial be designed to assess which patients would benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, and which patients would not.
<ABS> Hopefully this would result in less unnecessary antibiotic use, and thus less antibiotic resistance.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Penetrating abdominal trauma occurs when the peritoneal cavity is breached.
<INT> Routine laparotomy for penetrating abdominal injuries began in the 1800s, with antibiotics first being used in World War II to combat septic complications associated with these injuries.
<INT> This practice was marked with a reduction in sepsis-related mortality and morbidity.
<INT> Whether prophylactic antibiotics are required in the prevention of infective complications following penetrating abdominal trauma is controversial, however, as no randomised placebo controlled trials have been published to date.
<INT> There has also been debate about the timing of antibiotic prophylaxis.
<INT> In 1972 Fullen noted a 7% to 11% post-surgical infection rate with pre-operative antibiotics, a 33% to 57% infection rate with intra-operative antibiotic administration and 30% to 70% infection rate with only post-operative antibiotic administration.
<INT> Current guidelines state there is sufficient class I evidence to support the use of a single pre-operative broad spectrum antibiotic dose, with aerobic and anaerobic cover, and continuation (up to 24 hours) only in the event of a hollow viscus perforation found at exploratory laparotomy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Searches were not restricted by date, language or publication status.
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, issue 12 of 12), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) and PubMed.
<MaM> Searches were last conducted in January 2013.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Up to a quarter of pregnant women may need their labour started artificially, or induced, with the use of medication or by other means.
<ABS> With most methods of induction it takes some time for labour to actually start.
<ABS> This means that it may be more convenient to women, and cheaper for health service providers, if they are cared for in outpatient settings, such as in their own homes.
<ABS> Women who are at low obstetric or medical risk could be assessed in hospital, given the induction agent and then return home with clear instructions.
<ABS> The use of outpatient induction of labour attempts to balance possible improvements in maternal satisfaction, convenience, reduced length of stay in hospital and lower cost with the safety of both the mother and baby.
<ABS> Four randomised controlled trials with a combined total of 1439 women assessed the effects of induction of labour for women managed as outpatients versus inpatients.
<ABS> Out of a total of four studies, the induction agents differed in two studies, whereas the remaining two studies evaluated the same induction agent (vaginal PGE2).
<ABS> The limited information from these trials did not support more successful induction within 24 hours, shorter length of stay in hospital or differences in need for further induction or the mode of giving birth.
<ABS> The information available was limited and it is, therefore, not yet possible to determine whether induction of labour is effective and safe in outpatient settings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> More than 20% of women undergo induction of labour in some countries.
<INT> It is not known whether some methods of induction that are effective and safe in hospital are suitable in outpatient settings.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial reports for inclusion.
<MaM> Two review authors carried out data extraction and assessment of risk of bias independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials, with a combined total of 1439 women in the review; each trial examined a different method of induction and we were unable to pool the results from trials.
<RES> 1.
<RES> Vaginal PGE2 (two studies including 1028 women).
<RES> There were no differences between women managed as outpatients versus inpatients for most review outcomes.
<RES> There was no evidence of a difference between the likelihood of women requiring instrumental delivery in either setting (risk ratio (RR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.13).
<RES> The overall length of hospital stay was similar in the two groups.
<RES> 2.
<RES> Controlled release PGE2 10 mg (one study including 300 women).
<RES> There was no evidence of differences between groups for most review outcomes, including success of induction.
<RES> During the induction period itself, women in the outpatient group were more likely to report high levels of satisfaction with their care (satisfaction rated seven or more on a nine-point scale, RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.81), but satisfaction scores measured postnatally were similar in the two groups.
<RES> 3.
<RES> Foley catheter (one study including 111 women).
<RES> There was no evidence of differences between groups for caesarean section rates, total induction time and the numbers of babies admitted to neonatal intensive care.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The data available to evaluate the efficacy or potential hazards of outpatient induction are limited.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Cochrane review authors performed this systematic review to assess the effect of the addition of adherence compounds such as fibrin sealant and hyaluronic acid (HA) on pregnancy outcomes.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Couples who have trouble getting pregnant are able to make use of fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
<ABS> Over the years, much research has been performed to determine whether there are ways to increase the success rate of such treatments.
<ABS> One area of research has focused on the medium in which embryos are transferred back into the uterus.
<ABS> Adherence compounds have been added to the embryo transfer medium in attempts to increase the chance of the embryo adhering to the uterus, with a greater chance of pregnancy and the birth of a healthy newborn as a result.
<ABS> Many studies of these adherence compounds have been undertaken with some positive and negative results.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Seventeen randomised controlled trials (3898 participants) were included in the review.
<ABS> One studied fibrin sealant, and the other 16 studied HA.
<ABS> These studies took place in Israel, the United States of America, Turkey, Taiwan, Germany, Switzerland, Iran, Slovenia, Austria and Hungary.
<ABS> Investigators compared embryo transfer in a medium containing high versus low or no hyaluronic acid and in a medium containing fibrin sealant versus transfer in a medium with no fibrin sealant.
<ABS> Outcomes reported included live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, implantation rates, multiple pregnancy rates and other adverse events.
<ABS> The mean age of the women ranged from 27.5 to 35.7 years.
<ABS> The evidence gathered is current to November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Analysis of the 16 studies that were identified using functional concentrations of HA showed an increase in the chances of pregnancy and live birth (450 vs 367 per 1000) but also an increase in the chance of the more risky outcome of multiple pregnancy (282 vs 175 per 1000).
<ABS> This increase in multiple pregnancy rate may be the result of improved pregnancy outcomes due to the addition of the adherence compound and the policy of transferring more than one embryo back into the uterus.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence obtained for these comparisons was of moderate quality.
<ABS> It is important to note that evidence of a higher delivery rate was not found in all analyses; however, it was found in the overall meta-analysis.
<ABS> Based on the single identified study that used fibrin sealant, no evidence indicates that the addition of this compound to an embryo transfer medium improved pregnancy outcomes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 7).
<INT> To increase the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies (ART), adherence compounds such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and fibrin sealant have been introduced into subfertility management.
<INT> Adherence compounds are added to the embryo transfer medium to increase the likelihood of embryo implantation, with the potential for higher clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Furthermore, reference lists of all obtained studies were checked, and conference abstracts were handsearched.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The adherence compounds that were identified for evaluation were HA and fibrin sealant.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen studies with a total of 3898 participants were analysed.
<RES> One studied fibrin sealant, and the other 16 studied HA.
<RES> No evidence was found of a treatment effect of fibrin sealant as an adherence compound.
<RES> For HA, evidence of a positive treatment effect was identified in the six trials that reported live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.69; six RCTs, N = 1950, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Furthermore, the 14 trials reporting clinical pregnancy rates showed evidence of treatment benefit when embryos were transferred in media containing functional concentrations of HA (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.60; 14 RCTs, N = 3452, I2 = 46%, moderate-quality evidence) as compared with low or no use of HA.
<RES> The multiple pregnancy rate (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.31; five RCTs, N = 1951, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) was significantly increased in the high HA group, but no significant differences in adverse event rates were found (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.12; four RCTs, N = 1525, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence suggests improved clinical pregnancy and live birth rates with the use of functional concentrations of HA as an adherence compound in ART cycles.
<CON> However, the evidence obtained is of moderate quality.
<CON> The increase in multiple pregnancy rate may be the result of use of a combination of an adherence compound and a policy of transferring more than one embryo.
<CON> Further studies of adherence compounds with single embryo transfer need to be undertaken.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Nonselective beta-blockers for treatment of high blood pressure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Beta-blockers are a class of drug commonly used to treat high blood pressure.
<ABS> Nonselective beta-blockers are a subclass of beta-blockers including propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), etc. We asked how much this subclass of drugs lower blood pressure.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We developed a comprehensive search strategy of all relevant scientific databases to identify all clinical trials to answer this question.
<ABS> Participants had to have a baseline systolic blood pressure (the top number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number of a blood pressure reading) of at least 90 mmHg, or both of these.
<ABS> We did not restrict participants by age, gender, baseline risk or any other medical conditions.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 25 clinical trials that compared the blood pressure lowering effect of seven nonselective beta-blockers with placebo in 1264 people with high blood pressure.
<ABS> On average, nonselective beta-blockers lowered blood pressure by about 10 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic, and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute.
<ABS> This estimate is likely greater than the true effect because of biases in the running and reporting of the trials.
<ABS> We did not find convincing evidence that higher doses of nonselective beta-blockers lowered blood pressure more than lower doses.
<ABS> However, higher doses of nonselective beta-blockers significantly lowered heart rate compared with lower doses, which could lead to more side effects.
<ABS> Since the blood pressure lowering effect for systolic is similar to the blood pressure lowering effect of diastolic, the effect of this subclass on pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic) was small at about 2 mmHg.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is low due to the presence of extreme outliers and high risk of biases.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Beta-blockers are one of the classes of drugs frequently used to treat hypertension.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel or cross-over trials.
<MaM> Studies had to contain a nonselective beta-blocker monotherapy arm with a fixed dose.
<MaM> Participants enrolled into the studies had to have primary hypertension at baseline.
<MaM> Duration of studies had to be between three and 12 weeks.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (GW and AL) independently confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 RCTs that evaluated the BP lowering effects of seven nonselective beta-blockers in 1264 people with hypertension.
<RES> Among the 25 RCTs, four were parallel studies and 21 were cross-over studies.
<RES> Overall, nonselective beta-blockers lowered systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with placebo.
<RES> Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison.
<RES> The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size.
<RES> The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence).
<RES> The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison.
<RES> Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence).
<RES> The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup.
<RES> Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg.
<RES> There were very limited data (two studies) on withdrawals due to adverse effects (risk ratio (RR) 0.84; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.82).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In people with mild-to-moderate hypertension, nonselective beta-blockers lowered peak BP by a mean of -10/-7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) and reduced heart rate by 12 beats per minute.
<CON> Propranolol and penbutolol were the two drugs that contributed to most of the data for nonselective beta-blockers.
<CON> This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias.
<CON> If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)).
<CON> Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate.
<CON> Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect.
<CON> The effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure was likely small, at about 2 mmHg.

<H1> Pericyazine for schizophrenia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Pericyazine for the treatment of schizophrenia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia often experience symptoms such as hearing voices or seeing things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions).
<ABS> The first line and mainstay of treatment for the symptoms of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> These antipsychotic drugs can be grouped into older drugs (typical or first generation) and newer drugs (atypical or second generation).
<ABS> Pericyazine is a relatively old antipsychotic formulated in 1961.
<ABS> Some studies have suggested that it may be of more benefit than other antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> The quality of evidence was rated by the authors to be very low, and their results were imprecise for many outcomes where they compared pericyazine and other older and newer antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> The evidence is inadequate to determine whether pericyazine is better than other antipsychotics.
<ABS> The results of the analysis for the outcome of improvement were imprecise and the authors could not be certain that more people who took pericyazine were found to have not improved compared with those who took typical antipsychotics.
<ABS> More side effects, such as involuntary shaking, tremors, restlessness and spasms, were experienced by people who took pericyazine than other typical or atypical antipsychotics.
<ABS> These side effects are very unpleasant and the increased occurrence of them compared to other antipsychotics is an important finding considering pericyazine may not have additional benefits for the symptoms of schizophrenia.
<ABS> No studies reported outcomes on satisfaction of treatment or cost effectiveness, which require attention.
<ABS> This lack of evidence leaves people with schizophrenia, mental health professionals and policy makers with little information on the benefits, hazards or problems of pericyazine.
<ABS> Outcomes on the cost of care and satisfaction with treatment should be included in future trials which should also be larger, better conducted, and fully reported.
<ABS> (This plain language summary has been written by Ben Gray from Rethink Mental Illness).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pericyazine is a 3-cyano-10 (3-4'-hydroxypiperidinopropyl) phenothiazine.
<INT> It is overall pharmacologically similar with chlorpromazine, though particularly sedating.
<INT> Dopamine receptor subtype analysis has not been performed for pericyazine, but the drug appears to induce greater noradrenergic than dopaminergic blockade.
<INT> Compared to chlorpromazine, pericyazine reportedly has more potent antiemetic, antiserotonin, and anticholinergic activity.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (February 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO.
<MaM> We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We excluded quasi-randomised trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were extracted independently from included papers by at least two review authors.
<MaM> Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of homogeneous dichotomous data were calculated.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias for included studies and used GRADE to judge quality of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We could only include five studies conducted between 1965 and 1980.
<RES> Most of the included studies did not report details of randomisation, allocation concealment, details of blinding and we could not assess the impact of attrition due to poor reporting.
<RES> For the primary outcome of Global state - not improved, the confidence interval was compatible with a small benefit and increased risk of not improving with pericyazine compared with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 122, RR 1.24 CI 0.93 to 1.66, very low quality of evidence) or atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.97 CI 0.67 to 1.42, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> When compared with typical antipsychotics relapse was only experienced by one person taking pericyazine (1 RCT, n = 80, RR 2.59 CI 0.11 to 61.75, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> Pericyazine was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects than typical antipsychotics (3 RCTs, n = 163, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.80, very low quality of evidence) and atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 2.69 CI 1.35 to 5.36, very low quality of evidence).
<RES> The estimated risk of leaving the study early for specific reasons was imprecise for the comparisons of pericyazine with typical antipsychotics (2 RCTs, n = 71, RR 0.46 CI 0.11 to 1.90, very low quality of evidence), and with atypical antipsychotics (1 RCT, n = 93, RR 0.13 CI 0.01 to 2.42, very low quality of evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> On the basis of very low quality evidence we are unable to determine the effects of pericyazine in comparison with typical or atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia.
<CON> However, there is some evidence that pericyazine may be associated with a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than other antipsychotics, and again this was judged to be very low quality evidence.
<CON> Large, robust studies are still needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Single dose oral dexibuprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute pain is often felt soon after injury.
<ABS> Most people who have surgery have moderate or severe pain afterwards.
<ABS> People with pain are used to test pain killers.
<ABS> They have often had wisdom teeth removed.
<ABS> The pain is often treated with pain killers given by mouth.
<ABS> Results can be applied to other forms of acute pain.
<ABS> A series of reviews looks at how good pain killers are.
<ABS> It is thought to give the same pain relief at a lower dose.
<ABS> We found two clinical trials with 313 people.
<ABS> Dexibuprofen at 200 mg or 400 mg single doses probably produced useful pain relief.
<ABS> The small number of studies, and of people in them, meant that no sensible results about benefit or harm after taking the drug were available.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is an update of a previously published review in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issue 3, 2009 on single dose oral dexibuprofen (S(+)-ibuprofen) for acute postoperative pain in adults.
<INT> Dexibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) licensed for use in rheumatic disease and other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK, and widely available in other countries worldwide.
<INT> It is an active isomer of ibuprofen.
<INT> This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral dexibuprofen in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies in patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over four to six hours, using standard methods.
<INT> This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Searches were run for the original review in 2009 and subsequent searches have been run in August 2013.
<MaM> We did not find any new published studies as a result of the updated search.
<MaM> We searched for randomised studies of dexibuprofen in acute postoperative pain in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (The Cochrane LIbrary), and for clinical trial reports and synopses of published and unpublished studies from Internet sources.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy.
<MaM> We collected information on adverse events and withdrawals.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> New data were identified for this update in one unpublished trial synopsis (BR1160 1995) in addition to the single study (Dionne 1998) that was included in the original review.
<RES> In both studies dexibuprofen gave high levels of response, with 51/96 (53%) participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief with dexibuprofen 200 mg and 35/50 (70%) with dexibuprofen 400 mg, compared with 75/147 (51%) with racemic ibuprofen 400 mg, and 12/62 (13%) with placebo.
<RES> The numbers of participants was too small to calculate NNTs with any meaning.
<RES> The median time to additional analgesic use was greater than four hours for all active therapies, but about two hours for placebo.
<RES> Adverse events were generally of mild or moderate intensity and consistent with events normally associated with anaesthesia and surgery.
<RES> There were no serious adverse events or deaths.
<RES> Additional data did not alter the conclusions from the earlier review.

<H1> Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Nausea, retching or dry heaving, and vomiting in early pregnancy are very common and can be very distressing for women.
<ABS> Many treatments are available to women with 'morning sickness', including drugs and complementary and alternative therapies.
<ABS> Because of concerns that taking medications may adversely affect the development of the fetus, this review aimed to examine if these treatments have been found to be effective and safe.
<ABS> This review found a lack of high-quality evidence to back up any advice on which interventions to use.
<ABS> We examined 37 randomised controlled trials which included 5049 women in early pregnancy.
<ABS> These studies examined the effectiveness of many treatments including acupressure to the acupuncture point on the wrist (P6), acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, vitamin B6, lemon oil, mint oil, and several drugs that are used to reduce nausea or vomiting.
<ABS> Some studies showed a benefit in improving nausea and vomiting symptoms for women, but generally effects were inconsistent and limited.
<ABS> Studies were carried out in a way that meant they were at high risk of bias, and therefore, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions.
<ABS> Most studies had different ways of measuring the symptoms of nausea and vomiting and therefore, we could not look at these findings together.
<ABS> Few studies reported maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and there was very little information on the effectiveness of treatments for improving women's quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There are considerable physical, social and psychological effects on women who experience these symptoms.
<INT> This is an update of a review of interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy previously published in 2010.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All randomised controlled trials of any intervention for nausea, vomiting and retching in early pregnancy.
<MaM> We also excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials using a cross-over design.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-seven trials involving 5049 women, met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> These trials covered many interventions, including acupressure, acustimulation, acupuncture, ginger, chamomile, lemon oil, mint oil, vitamin B6 and several antiemetic drugs.
<RES> We identified no studies of dietary or other lifestyle interventions.
<RES> Evidence regarding the effectiveness of P6 acupressure, auricular (ear) acupressure and acustimulation of the P6 point was limited.
<RES> Acupuncture (P6 or traditional) showed no significant benefit to women in pregnancy.
<RES> The use of ginger products may be helpful to women, but the evidence of effectiveness was limited and not consistent, though two recent studies support ginger over placebo.
<RES> There was only limited evidence from trials to support the use of pharmacological agents including vitamin B6, and anti-emetic drugs to relieve mild or moderate nausea and vomiting.
<RES> There was little information on maternal and fetal adverse outcomes and on psychological, social or economic outcomes.
<RES> We were unable to pool findings from studies for most outcomes due to heterogeneity in study participants, interventions, comparison groups, and outcomes measured or reported.
<RES> The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Given the high prevalence of nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy, women and health professionals need clear guidance about effective and safe interventions, based on systematically reviewed evidence.
<CON> There is a lack of high-quality evidence to support any particular intervention.
<CON> This is not the same as saying that the interventions studied are ineffective, but that there is insufficient strong evidence for any one intervention.
<CON> The difficulties in interpreting and pooling the results of the studies included in this review highlight the need for specific, consistent and clearly justified outcomes and approaches to measurement in research studies.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Written emotional disclosure for asthma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Stress may cause worsening of asthma.
<ABS> Previous studies showed that "written emotional disclosure," an activity that encourages people to write about stressful experiences, helps to reduce stress and improve well-being.
<ABS> Therefore written emotional disclosure may have a role in the management of asthma by reducing stress.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the medical literature to find out whether written emotional disclosure improves lung function and asthma symptoms in asthmatic patients.
<ABS> We looked at studies that compared the effectiveness of completing written emotional disclosure versus writing about topics unrelated to emotion.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Four studies, involving 414 participants, were included in this review.
<ABS> The trials lasted between two months and 12 months.
<ABS> One study was conducted in the UK, the other three in the USA.
<ABS> All studies compared emotional disclosure writing versus non-stressful writing.
<ABS> Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents.
<ABS> The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years.
<ABS> In all trials, most of the participants were female.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is no evidence to support that written emotional disclosure is helpful in improving lung function or symptoms in patients with asthma.
<ABS> However, disclosure may be beneficial for patients' perceptions of their own asthma control.
<ABS> Based on evidence obtained from the studies, we are not able to draw conclusions about the role of written emotional disclosure in quality of life, psychological well-being, asthma medication use or use of healthcare facilities for asthma-related problems.
<ABS> Better designed studies are necessary to determine the effects of written emotional disclosure for patients with asthma.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Our interpretation of the studies was limited by variation in study settings, topics of the non-stressful writing exercise and study duration.
<ABS> The evidence presented in this review is generally of low quality.
<ABS> This summary was current to January 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Psychological stress has been widely implicated in asthma exacerbation.
<INT> Written emotional disclosure may have a role in the management of asthma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO.
<MaM> The latest search was conducted in January 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed studies against predetermined inclusion criteria and extracted the data.
<MaM> Corresponding authors were contacted when necessary to provide additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies, involving a total of 414 participants, met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> Three studies were conducted in adult participants and one in adolescents.
<RES> The average age of participants ranged from 14 to 43 years.
<RES> The trials lasted between two months and 12 months.
<RES> The interventions were based on Pennebaker's method.
<RES> The risk of bias across most domains of the studies was generally considered to be low, however three of four studies were considered at high risk of bias due to lack of assessor blinding and one study was at high risk of bias for selective reporting.
<RES> The interpretation of these studies was limited by diverse outcome measurements, measurement tools, control group techniques, and number and/or times of follow-up.
<RES> Similarly, evidence from two studies indicated that written emotional disclosure found uncertain effect on forced vital capacity (FVC) (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; low-quality evidence) and asthma symptoms (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.09; low-quality evidence) but may result in improved asthma control at ≤ three months' follow-up (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.58; low-quality evidence).
<RES> We were unable to pool the data for other outcomes.
<RES> Results from individual trials did not reveal a significant benefit of written emotional disclosure for quality of life, medication use, healthcare utilisation or psychological well-being.
<RES> Evidence from one trial suggests a significant reduction in beta agonist use (MD -1.62, 95% CI -2.62 to -0.62; low-quality evidence) at ≤ three months' follow-up in the disclosure group compared with controls.
<RES> The review did not address any adverse effects of emotional writing.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence was insufficient to show whether written emotional disclosure compared with writing about non-emotional topics had an effect on the outcomes included in this review.
<CON> The evidence presented in this review is generally of low quality.
<CON> Better designed studies with standardised reporting of outcome measurement instruments are required to determine the effectiveness of written emotional disclosure in the management of asthma.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background: Quality of life and exercise tolerance are commonly reduced in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
<ABS> In addition, physical activity levels are lower compared with those of healthy people of a similar age.
<ABS> Exercise training as a part of a formal rehabilitation programme is an important component of management for people with COPD and has been shown to improve both quality of life and exercise tolerance.
<ABS> However, some individuals may have difficulty performing exercise at an adequate training intensity.
<ABS> Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a method of providing breathing support using a machine called a ventilator.
<ABS> Breathing support is delivered via a mask that is worn over the nose, mouth or both, or via a mouthpiece.
<ABS> During a single exercise session, NIV has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and reduce breathlessness.
<ABS> Consequently, NIV used over multiple exercise sessions (during exercise training) may allow people with COPD to exercise at a higher intensity and potentially to achieve greater improvement in exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity.
<ABS> Review question: We conducted a review to determine whether NIV during exercise training affects exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV (placebo) in people with COPD.
<ABS> Study characteristics: The evidence is current to November 2013.
<ABS> We included six studies involving 126 participants who completed the study protocols.
<ABS> Most studies recruited participants with severe to very severe COPD.
<ABS> The average age of participants ranged from 63 to 71 years.
<ABS> Cycling or treadmill exercise training was performed in the studies.
<ABS> The duration of exercise training programmes ranged from six to twelve weeks.
<ABS> Key results: The percentage change in peak exercise capacity increased by an average of 17% in three studies, and the percentage change in endurance exercise capacity by an average of 59% in two studies that provided NIV during training compared with training without NIV or training with sham NIV.
<ABS> However, these improvements in exercise capacity were not consistent findings as there was no clear evidence that NIV improved all other measures of exercise capacity.
<ABS> The results for quality of life were uncertain and our analysis did not exclude there being an effect with NIV during exercise training in two studies.
<ABS> Physical activity was not assessed in any of the studies.
<ABS> Non-invasive ventilation allowed participants to exercise at a higher training intensity (average of 13% higher) in three studies, and evidence of a greater training effect on the muscles was found in two studies, as a marker in the blood (isoload blood lactate) was significantly lower by an average of 0.97 mmol/L. No information regarding adverse events or cost was reported.
<ABS> It is currently unknown whether demonstrated benefits of NIV during exercise training are clinically worthwhile or cost-effective.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: This review was generally limited by the small number of included studies and the small numbers of participants within the included studies.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was low for exercise capacity outcomes, largely because of issues with study design.
<ABS> Consequently, the effect of NIV during exercise training on exercise capacity is uncertain.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence for quality of life, training intensity and isoload blood lactate was moderate, and these findings can be interpreted with a greater degree of confidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Exercise training as a component of pulmonary rehabilitation improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
<INT> However, some individuals may have difficulty performing exercise at an adequate intensity.
<INT> Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise improves exercise capacity and dyspnoea during a single exercise session.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies involving 126 participants who completed the study protocols were included.
<RES> There was an increase in percentage change peak and endurance exercise capacity with NIV during training (mean difference in peak exercise capacity 17%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7% to 27%, 60 participants, low-quality evidence; mean difference in endurance exercise capacity 59%, 95% CI 4% to 114%, 48 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> However, there was no clear evidence of a difference between interventions for all other measures of exercise capacity.
<RES> The results for HRQL assessed using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire do not rule out an effect of NIV (total score mean 2.5 points, 95% CI -2.3 to 7.2, 48 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Physical activity was not assessed in any study.
<RES> There was an increase in training intensity with NIV during training of 13% (95% CI 1% to 27%, 67 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and isoload lactate was lower with NIV (mean difference -0.97 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.58mmol/L to -0.36 mmol/L, 37 participants, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> The effect of NIV on dyspnoea or the number of dropouts between interventions was uncertain, although again results were imprecise.
<RES> No adverse events and no information regarding cost were reported.
<RES> Only one study blinded participants, whereas three studies used blinded assessors.
<RES> Adequate allocation concealment was reported in four studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The small number of included studies with small numbers of participants, as well as the high risk of bias within some of the included studies, limited our ability to draw strong evidence-based conclusions.
<CON> Although NIV during lower limb exercise training may allow people with COPD to exercise at a higher training intensity and to achieve a greater physiological training effect compared with exercise training alone or exercise training with sham NIV, the effect on exercise capacity is unclear.
<CON> Some evidence suggests that NIV during exercise training improves the percentage change in peak and endurance exercise capacity; however, these findings are not consistent across other measures of exercise capacity.
<CON> There is no clear evidence that HRQL is better or worse with NIV during training.
<CON> It is currently unknown whether the demonstrated benefits of NIV during exercise training are clinically worthwhile or cost-effective.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Undifferentiated acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are large and varied groups of infections that are not clearly restricted to one specific part of the upper respiratory tract.
<ABS> They last for up to seven days.
<ABS> Common respiratory infections have a wide variety of causes, leading to potential complications such as ear, throat and sinus infections.
<ABS> These infections are more common in pre-school children and are the most frequent reasons for parents to seek medical assistance.
<ABS> Furthermore, they are responsible for 75% of the total prescribed antibiotics in high-income countries.
<ABS> This review focuses on the use of antibiotics to prevent clinical bacterial complications in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs.
<ABS> We included four trials (1314 children).
<ABS> Three trials investigated the prevention of ear infections and one investigated the prevention of pneumonia.
<ABS> Just one of the included trials addressed outcomes related to adverse effects caused by antibiotics in children with undifferentiated ARI.
<ABS> However, the trial's data could not be analysed as it was expressed in percentages rather than absolute terms.
<ABS> Our goal was to evaluate the benefits and harms of the use of antibiotics in preventing bacterial complications in children up to five years of age with undifferentiated ARIs.
<ABS> The quality of evidence currently available does not provide strong support for antibiotic use in preventing ear infections and pneumonia in children with undifferentiated ARIs.
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Undifferentiated acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a large and heterogeneous group of infections not clearly restricted to one specific part of the upper respiratory tract, which last for up to seven days.
<INT> They are more common in pre-school children in low-income countries and are responsible for 75% of the total amount of prescribed antibiotics in high-income countries.
<INT> One possible rationale for prescribing antibiotics is the wish to prevent bacterial complications.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified four trials involving 1314 children.
<RES> Three trials investigated the use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to prevent otitis and one investigated ampicillin to prevent pneumonia.
<RES> The use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid compared to placebo to prevent otitis showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.11, three trials, 414 selected children, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not clearly stated in two trials.
<RES> Performance, detection and reporting bias could not be ruled out in three trials.
<RES> Ampicillin compared to supportive care (continuation of breastfeeding, clearing of the nose and paracetamol for fever control) to prevent pneumonia showed a RR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.49, one trial, 889 selected children, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> The trial was non-blinded.
<RES> Random sequence generation and allocation concealment methods were not clearly stated so the possibility of reporting bias could not be ruled out.
<RES> Harm outcomes could not be analysed as they were expressed only in percentages.
<RES> No studies were found assessing mastoiditis, quinsy, abscess, meningitis, hospital admission or death.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further high-quality research is needed to provide more definitive evidence of the effectiveness of antibiotics in this population.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Those suffering from heart disease and heart failure are currently treated with drugs and, when possible, the blood supply is restored in the heart (revascularisation) either by opening the arteries with a tiny balloon in a procedure called primary angioplasty (or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) or by heart surgery (or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)).
<ABS> Revascularisation has reduced the death rate associated with these conditions.
<ABS> In some people heart disease and heart failure symptoms persist even after revascularisation.
<ABS> Those people may not have other treatments available to them.
<ABS> Recently, bone marrow stem/progenitor cells have been investigated as a new treatment for people with heart disease and heart failure, whether they are also treated for revascularisation or not.
<ABS> Results from 23 randomised controlled trials, covering more than 1200 participants, to 2013 indicates that this new treatment leads to a reduction in deaths and readmission to hospital and improvements over standard treatment as measured by tests of heart function.
<ABS> At present, these results provide some evidence that stem cell treatment may be of benefit in people both with chronic ischaemic heart disease and with heart failure.
<ABS> Adverse events are rare, with no long-term adverse events reported.
<ABS> However, the quality of the evidence is relatively low because there were few deaths and hospital readmissions in the studies, and individual study results varied.
<ABS> Further research involving a large number of participants is required to confirm these results.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A promising approach to the treatment of chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure is the use of stem cells.
<INT> The last decade has seen a plethora of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) developed worldwide which have generated conflicting results.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Eligible studies included RCTs comparing autologous adult stem/progenitor cells with no autologous stem/progenitor cells in participants with chronic IHD and heart failure.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened all references for eligibility, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We undertook a quantitative evaluation of data using fixed-effect meta-analyses.
<MaM> We evaluated heterogeneity using the I² statistic; we explored considerable heterogeneity (I² > 75%) using a random-effects model and subgroup analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We include 23 RCTs involving 1255 participants in this review.
<RES> Risk of bias was generally low, with the majority of studies reporting appropriate methods of randomisation and blinding, Autologous bone marrow stem cell treatment reduced the incidence of mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.53, P = 0.0001, 8 studies, 494 participants, low quality evidence) and rehospitalisation due to heart failure (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.94, P = 0.04, 2 studies, 198 participants, low quality evidence) in the long term (≥12 months).
<RES> The treatment had no clear effect on mortality (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.41, P = 0.30, 21 studies, 1138 participants, low quality evidence) or rehospitalisation due to heart failure (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.06, P = 0.06, 4 studies, 236 participants, low quality evidence) in the short term (< 12 months), which is compatible with benefit, no difference or harm.
<RES> The treatment was also associated with a reduction in left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) (mean difference (MD) -14.64 ml, 95% CI -20.88 ml to -8.39 ml, P < 0.00001, 3 studies, 153 participants, moderate quality evidence) and stroke volume index (MD 6.52, 95% CI 1.51 to 11.54, P = 0.01, 2 studies, 62 participants, moderate quality evidence), and an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (MD 2.62%, 95% CI 0.50% to 4.73%, P = 0.02, 6 studies, 254 participants, moderate quality evidence), all at long-term follow-up.
<RES> Overall, we observed a reduction in functional class (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class) in favour of BMSC treatment during short-term follow-up (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.08 to -0.19, P = 0.005, 11 studies, 486 participants, moderate quality evidence) and long-term follow-up (MD -0.91, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.44, P = 0.0002, 4 studies, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence), as well as a difference in Canadian Cardiovascular Society score in favour of BMSC (MD -0.81, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.07, P = 0.03, 8 studies, 379 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Of 19 trials in which adverse events were reported, adverse events relating to the BMSC treatment or procedure occurred in only four individuals.
<RES> No long-term adverse events were reported.
<RES> Subgroup analyses conducted for outcomes such as LVEF and NYHA class revealed that (i) route of administration, (ii) baseline LVEF, (iii) cell type, and (iv) clinical condition are important factors that may influence treatment effect.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review and meta-analysis found moderate quality evidence that BMSC treatment improves LVEF.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of the effect of paying for performance to improve the delivery of health care in low- and middle-income countries.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, they found nine studies that met their requirements.
<ABS> The findings of this review are summarised below.
<ABS> What is pay for performance?
<ABS> This approach can be directed at patients, health workers or healthcare organisations.
<ABS> Patients are sometimes rewarded if they use particular healthcare services.
<ABS> Health workers and healthcare organisations may be rewarded if they offer particular services, if they deliver care that is of a certain quality, or if their patients make use of particular services.
<ABS> This review focused on pay for performance approaches that target the behaviour of health workers and healthcare organisations.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was generally very low.
<ABS> It is therefore not possible to draw general conclusions.
<ABS> There is a need for more and better research in this area.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There is a growing interest in paying for performance as a means to align the incentives of health workers and health providers with public health goals.
<INT> However, there is currently a lack of rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
<INT> Moreover, paying for performance is a complex intervention with uncertain benefits and potential harms.
<INT> A review of evidence on effectiveness is therefore timely, especially as this is an area of growing interest for funders and governments.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched the websites and online resources of numerous international agencies, organisations and universities to find relevant grey literature and contacted experts in the field.
<MaM> We carried out an updated search on the Results-Based Financing website in April 2011, and re-ran the MEDLINE search in June 2011.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies also needed to use one of the following study designs: randomised trial, non-randomised trial, controlled before-after study or interrupted time series study, and had to have been conducted in low- or middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We aimed to present a meta-analysis of results.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine studies were included in the review: one randomised trial, six controlled before-after studies and two interrupted time series studies (or studies which could be re-analysed as such).
<RES> The interventions were varied: one used target payments linked to quality of care (in the Philippines).
<RES> Two used target payments linked to coverage indicators (in Tanzania and Zambia).
<RES> Three used conditional cash transfers, modified by quality measurements (in Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo).
<RES> Two used conditional cash transfers without quality measures (in Rwanda and Vietnam).
<RES> One used a mix of conditional cash transfers and target payments (China).
<RES> Targeted services also varied.
<RES> Most of the interventions used a wide range of targets covering inpatient, outpatient and preventive care, including a strong emphasis on services for women and children.
<RES> However, one focused specifically on tuberculosis (the main outcome measure was cases detected); one on hospital revenues; and one on improved treatment of common illnesses in under-sixes.
<RES> Participants were in most cases in a mix of public and faith-based facilities (dispensaries, health posts, health centres and hospitals), though districts were also involved and in one case payments were made direct to individual private practitioners.
<RES> One study was considered to have low risk of bias and one a moderate risk of bias.
<RES> The other seven studies had a high risk of bias.
<RES> Only one study included any patient health indicators.
<RES> Of the four outcome measures, two showed significant improvement for the intervention group (wasting and self reported health by parents of the under-fives), while two showed no significant difference (being C-reactive protein (CRP)-negative and not anaemic).
<RES> The two more robust studies both found mixed results – gains for some indicators but no improvement for others.
<RES> Almost all dimensions of potential impact remain under-studied, including intended and unintended impact on health outcomes, equity, organisational change, user payments and satisfaction, resource use and staff satisfaction.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background - what is OA of the hip and what is exercise?
<ABS> OA is a disease of the joints, such as your hip.
<ABS> When the joint loses cartilage, the bone grows to try to repair the damage.
<ABS> However, instead of making things better, the bone grows abnormally and makes things worse.
<ABS> For example, the bone can become misshapen and make the joint painful and unstable.
<ABS> Doctors used to think that osteoarthritis (OA) simply resulted in thinning of the cartilage.
<ABS> However, it is now known that OA is a disease of the whole joint.
<ABS> OA is one of the most common forms of arthritis and affects men and women equally.
<ABS> OA is one of the main causes of disability as people grow older.
<ABS> Exercise can be any activity that enhances or maintains muscle strength, physical fitness and overall health.
<ABS> People exercise for many different reasons including weight loss, strengthening muscles and to relieve the symptoms of OA.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This summary of an update of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of exercise for people with OA of the hip.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies up to February 2013, we included five new studies since the last version of the review, giving 10 studies (549 participants) with mostly mild-to-moderate symptomatic hip OA, alone or with knee OA.
<ABS> Except for one study where participants enrolled in a tai chi programme, all other participants underwent land-based exercise programmes consisting of traditional muscle strengthening, functional training and aerobic fitness programmes, either individually supervised or as part of a group, compared with people who did not exercise.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Pain on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower scores mean reduced pain):
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain to be 8 points lower (4 to 11 points lower) at end of treatment (8% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their pain as 21 points.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their pain as 29 points.
<ABS> Physical function on a scale of 0 to 100 points (lower score means better physical function):
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function to be 7 points lower (1 to 12 points lower) at end of treatment (7% absolute improvement) compared with people who did not exercise.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their physical function as 22 points.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their physical function as 29 points.
<ABS> Quality of life (higher score means better quality of life):
<ABS> - Overall, people with hip OA participating in the studies had a similar quality of life compared with the general population (normative scores of average 50 points), and quality of life was not further improved by participation in an exercise programme: 0 points higher.
<ABS> - People who completed an exercise programme rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale.
<ABS> - People who did not exercise rated their quality of life as 50 points on a population norm-based scale.
<ABS> Withdrawals
<ABS> - three more people out of 100 dropped out of the exercise programme (1% absolute increase).
<ABS> - Six out of 100 people in exercise programmes dropped out.
<ABS> - Three out of 100 people who did not exercise dropped out.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review showed that there is high-quality evidence that in people with hip OA, exercise reduced pain slightly and improved physical function slightly.
<ABS> Further research is unlikely to change the estimate of these results.
<ABS> Low-quality evidence indicated that exercise may not improve quality of life.
<ABS> Further research is likely to change the estimate of these results.
<ABS> Moderate-quality evidence showed that exercise probably does not increase study drop-outs.
<ABS> Further research may change the estimate.
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects such as injuries or falls during exercise, but we would expect these to be rare, and no injuries were reported in the studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Four review authors independently selected studies for inclusion.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements through consensus.
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.
<MaM> We conducted analyses on continuous outcomes (pain, physical function and quality of life) and dichotomous outcomes (proportion of study withdrawals).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We considered that seven of the 10 included RCTs had a low risk of bias.
<RES> However, the results may be vulnerable to performance and detection bias as none of the RCTs were able to blind participants to treatment allocation and, while most RCTs reported blinded outcome assessment, pain, physical function and quality of life were participant self reported.
<RES> One of the 10 RCTs was only reported as a conference abstract and did not provide sufficient data for the evaluation of bias risk.
<RES> High-quality evidence from nine trials (549 participants) indicated that exercise reduced pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.20) and improved physical function (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.05) immediately after treatment.
<RES> Pain and physical function were estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain or loss of physical function) in the control group; exercise reduced pain by an equivalent of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 11 points; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6) and improved physical function by an equivalent of 7 points (95% CI 1 to 12 points; NNTB 6).
<RES> Only three small studies (183 participants) evaluated quality of life, with overall low quality evidence, with no benefit of exercise demonstrated (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.36).
<RES> Quality of life was estimated to be 50 points on a norm-based mean (standard deviation (SD)) score of 50 (10) in the general population in the control group; exercise improved quality of life by 0 points.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence from seven trials (715 participants) indicated an increased likelihood of withdrawal from the exercise allocation (event rate 6%) compared with the control group (event rate 3%), but this difference was not significant (risk difference 1%; 95% CI -1% to 4%).
<RES> Of the five studies reporting adverse events, each study reported only one or two events and all were related to increased pain attributed to the exercise programme.
<RES> The reduction in pain was sustained at least three to six months after ceasing monitored treatment (five RCTs, 391 participants): pain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.18).
<RES> Pain was estimated to be 29 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no pain) in the control group, the improvement in pain translated to a sustained reduction in pain intensity of 8 points (95% CI 4 to 12 points) compared with the control group (0 to 100 scale).
<RES> The improvement in physical function was also sustained (five RCTs, 367 participants): physical function (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.57 to -0.16).
<RES> Physical function was estimated to be 24 points on a 0- to 100-point scale (0 was no loss of physical function) in the control group, the improvement translated to a mean of 7 points (95% CI 4 to 13) compared with the control group.
<RES> Only five of the 10 RCTs exclusively recruited people with symptomatic hip OA (419 participants).
<RES> There was no significant difference in pain or physical function outcomes compared with five studies recruiting participants with hip or knee OA (130 participants).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence on the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during general anaesthesia in adult patients 16 years of age and older.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PEEP is a mechanical technique that is often used for ventilating an unconscious patient.
<ABS> The technique involves adding a quantity of pressure into the lungs at the end of each breath.
<ABS> This process causes a degree of deflation in the lungs and can collapse some areas because between breaths, the lungs contain less air than usual.
<ABS> By adding positive pressure at that time, we aim to reinflate the collapsed areas of the lung (atelectasis).
<ABS> Although PEEP can be used during general anaesthesia, some lung areas collapse at the end of the anaesthetic procedure.
<ABS> We do not know whether patients who receive PEEP have lower risks of postoperative mortality (approximately 3% to 5% of adult patients) or respiratory complications.
<ABS> In this review, we aimed to assess the postoperative benefits and harms of using PEEP during general anaesthesia.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to October 2013.
<ABS> We found 10 randomized clinical trials involving 432 participants.
<ABS> The main limitation of our review was our inability to identify studies analysing intraoperative data.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Six trials reported mortality.
<ABS> We pooled these data and found no differences between the group of patients who received PEEP and those who did not, but because of the small number of patients, and the fact that this outcome may be rare, these results did not allow us to make a conclusion about the effect of PEEP on mortality.
<ABS> Two results suggested some benefit of PEEP.
<ABS> First, oxygenation was better on the day after surgery in the PEEP group.
<ABS> Second, radiological imaging showed less atelectasis after surgery in the PEEP group.
<ABS> The studies that we found did not suggest that intraoperative PEEP causes harm.
<ABS> Because of the small number of studies, this finding is inconclusive.
<ABS> We performed calculations to predict how many more participants would be needed before reliable conclusions can be made about the effect on mortality of the application of PEEP.
<ABS> This number was 21,200.
<ABS> Evidence is currently insufficient to allow conclusions about how intraoperative PEEP affects postoperative mortality and respiratory complications.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is very low because of poorly conducted studies, small numbers of participants and low event rates.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> General anaesthesia causes atelectasis, which can lead to impaired respiratory function.
<INT> Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a mechanical manoeuvre that increases functional residual capacity (FRC) and prevents collapse of the airways, thereby reducing atelectasis.
<INT> It is not known whether intraoperative PEEP alters the risks of postoperative mortality and pulmonary complications.
<INT> This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2013.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The original search was performed in January 2010.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected papers, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors to ask for additional information, when necessary.
<MaM> We calculated the number of additional participants needed (information size) to make reliable conclusions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This updated review includes two new randomized trials.
<RES> In total, 10 randomized trials with 432 participants and four comparisons are included in this review.
<RES> One trial had a low risk of bias.
<RES> No differences were demonstrated in mortality, with risk ratio (RR) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 4.59; P value 0.97; 268 participants, six trials, very low quality of evidence (grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE)), and in pneumonia, with RR of 0.40 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.39; P value 0.15; 120 participants, three trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)).
<RES> Statistically significant results included the following: The PEEP group had higher arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) on day one postoperatively, with a mean difference of 22.98 (95% CI 4.40 to 41.55; P value 0.02; 80 participants, two trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)), and postoperative atelectasis (defined as an area of collapsed lung, quantified by computerized tomography scan) was less in the PEEP group (standard mean difference -1.2, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.79; P value 0.00001; 88 participants, two trials, very low quality of evidence (GRADE)).
<RES> No adverse events were reported in the three trials that adequately measured these outcomes (barotrauma and cardiac complications).
<RES> Using information size calculations, we estimated that a further 21,200 participants would have to be randomly assigned to allow a reliable conclusion about PEEP and mortality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About half a million children are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) every year, usually infecting the lungs, but also other organs of the body, and can cause meningitis.
<ABS> Infection in children is relatively common, and so establishing effective drug regimens that are easy to take and monitor is important.
<ABS> TB drug regimens are standardised globally, and include a combination of drugs given daily for six months.
<ABS> More than 95% of children are cured with this treatment.
<ABS> Giving anti-TB drugs twice- or thrice-weekly is more convenient to supervise than daily treatment but may not be as effective as daily treatment in curing children of TB.
<ABS> The World Health Organization currently recommends only daily treatments, but some national governments recommend twice- or thrice-weekly doses for children with TB.
<ABS> In this Cochrane review, the review authors compared children given intermittent anti-TB treatment to those given daily treatment.
<ABS> They examined the evidence up to 30 May 2013 and included four randomized trials that compared twice-weekly treatment with daily doses of anti-TB drugs, but none evaluated thrice-weekly dosing.
<ABS> The four trials included 563 children aged five months to 15 years, not known to be resistant to TB drugs.
<ABS> The trials were published over 12 years ago and the regimens used are not those currently recommended.
<ABS> The trials were small, and did not detect a difference between twice-weekly or daily treatment in the number of children who were cured, died, relapsed, reported taking most or all of the drugs, or had adverse effects.
<ABS> Whether regimens of drugs two or three times a week are as good as regimens with daily doses remains unclear, as the evidence base to date is small, and the regimens tested are not the same as currently currently recommended drug combinations.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a neglected global public health problem.
<INT> Current international and national recommendations differ on use of intermittent regimens to treat TB in children.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All regimens had to contain rifampicin for at least the first two months.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> We sought clarifications from trial authors.
<MaM> We pooled relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals and used a random-effects model where there was significant heterogeneity.
<MaM> We assessed overall evidence-quality using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials published between 1996 to 2000 that randomized 563 children (465 evaluable) aged five months to 15 years to intermittent twice-weekly versus daily anti-TB treatment.
<RES> Two trials were from India, one from South Africa, and one from Turkey.
<RES> All trials used rifampicin and isoniazid, three trials used pyrazinamide, and one trial used streptomycin.
<RES> The drug combination, and the duration of intermittent and daily treatments differed between trials, and no trials used drug combinations and schedules currently recommended for childhood TB.
<RES> No trial reported if any child was HIV-positive.
<RES> In comparisons of twice-weekly versus daily anti-TB treatment regimens, the trials did not detect differences in the number of patients cured, but trials were small, and the comparator regimens were not standard (four trials, 465 children; very low quality evidence).
<RES> Trials were underpowered to provide estimates for death (two trials, 213 participants, very low quality evidence), relapse (one trial, 214 participants, very low quality evidence), and treatment limiting adverse events (four trials, 441 participants, very low quality evidence)
<RES> Reported adherence to treatment was similar (87% versus 84%; four trials, 458 children, very low quality evidence)
<RES> We did not find trials comparing the commonly used thrice-weekly anti-TB short-course regimen with the daily treatment regimen.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Further randomized trials conducted in high TB-transmission settings will help inform policy and practice.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The effects of singing on lung function and quality of life in children and adults with cystic fibrosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with cystic fibrosis are at risk of chest infections due to abnormally thick mucus in their airways.
<ABS> Airway clearance is therefore an important part of cystic fibrosis management.
<ABS> Increasing anecdotal reports suggests that singing may support lung function and enhance quality of life in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> We searched for trials using the standard search methods of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group, and conducted extensive searches in other relevant databases and publications.
<ABS> One small study evaluated the effects of singing on the quality of life and lung function of children with cystic fibrosis who are in hospital.
<ABS> However, both the singing and control groups showed improvements in some quality of life measurements; and no differences were reported in other lung function measures.
<ABS> There is currently not enough evidence to show that singing can improve clinical outcomes in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> Future studies using robust methods are needed to assess the possible effects of singing for people with cystic fibrosis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited, life-threatening condition that affects major organs.
<INT> Previous studies have found that compliance with this intensive treatment is poor, especially among adolescents.
<INT> Because of both the nature and consequences of the illness and the relentless demands of the treatment, many individuals with cystic fibrosis have a poor quality of life.
<INT> Anecdotal reports suggest that singing may provide both appropriate exercise for the whole respiratory system and a means of emotional expression which may enhance quality of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
<MaM> Date of latest search: 31 March 2014.
<MaM> We also searched major allied complementary data bases, and clinical trial registers.
<MaM> Additionally, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and journals.
<MaM> Date of latest search: 24 May 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Only one eligible trial was available for analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Since only one small study was included, no meta-analysis could be performed.
<RES> The included study was a parallel, randomised controlled trial undertaken at two paediatric hospitals in Australia.
<RES> The study evaluated the effects of a singing program on the quality of life and respiratory muscle strength of hospitalised children with cystic fibrosis (mean age 11.6 years, 35% male).
<RES> While the singing group received eight individual singing sessions, the control group participated in preferred recreational activities, such as playing computer games or watching movies.
<RES> This study was limited by a small sample size (51 participants) and a high drop-out rate (21%).
<RES> For the respiratory muscle strength indices, maximal expiratory pressure at follow up (six to eight weeks post-intervention) was higher in the singing group, mean difference 25.80 (95% confidence interval 5.94 to 45.66).
<RES> There was no significant difference between groups for any of the other respiratory function parameters (maximal inspiratory pressure, spirometry) at either post-intervention or follow up.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of singing on quality of life or on the respiratory parameters in people with cystic fibrosis.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> What are the effects of dietary interventions or physical activity interventions, or both, based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) stages of change (SOC) to produce sustainable (one year and longer) weight loss in overweight and obese adults?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Generally, weight loss programmes tend to involve diet and physical activity interventions.
<ABS> The TTM describes a series of five SOC an individual goes through when changing from an unhealthy behaviour to a healthy one.
<ABS> In this review, we assessed the use of the TTM SOC in weight management programmes for overweight and obese adults especially in terms of the effects on weight loss, dietary habits, physical activity and behaviour changes.
<ABS> Obesity (body mass index of at least 30 kg/m²) and overweight (body mass index of 25 to less than 30 kg/m²) are increasingly being recognised as important public health issues.
<ABS> Together, they contribute to serious health problems and extensive economic costs worldwide.
<ABS> Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat and is defined as the individual's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/m²).
<ABS> The BMI should be considered as a rough guide only because it is mainly used for whole populations and may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals (like for athletes and physically non-active individuals).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included three studies in our systematic review.
<ABS> Altogether the studies evaluated 2971 participants, with 1467 participants allocated to the intervention groups and 1504 to the control groups.
<ABS> The studies had a length of intervention of 9, 12 and 24 months.
<ABS> This plain language summary was current as of December 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The use of the TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies provided inconclusive evidence about the impact of such interventions on sustainable weight loss (mean difference in favour of the TTM SOC was between 2.1 kg and 0.2 kg at 24 months).
<ABS> However, other positive effects were noted, such as changes in physical activity and dietary habits that included increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption.
<ABS> The studies did not report other important outcomes such as health-related quality of life, illness (morbidity) and economic costs.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.
<ABS> The main limitations included incomplete reporting of outcomes, methodological shortcomings, extensive use of self-reported measures and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to the lack of long-term assessments.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Obesity is a global public health threat.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases.
<MaM> We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO.
<MaM> The date of the last search, for all databases, was 17 December 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).
<MaM> We resolved disagreements by discussion or consultation with a third party.
<MaM> A narrative, descriptive analysis was conducted for the systematic review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of three studies met the inclusion criteria, allocating 2971 participants to the intervention and control groups.
<RES> The total number of participants randomised to the intervention groups was 1467, whilst 1504 were randomised to the control groups.
<RES> The length of intervention was 9, 12 and 24 months in the different trials.
<RES> The use of TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies produced inconclusive evidence that TTM SOC interventions led to sustained weight loss (the mean difference between intervention and control groups varied from 2.1 kg to 0.2 kg at 24 months; 2971 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence).
<RES> Following application of TTM SOC there were improvements in physical activity and dietary habits, such as increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced dietary fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Weight gain was reported as an adverse event in one of the included trials.
<RES> None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, or economic costs as outcomes.
<RES> The small number of studies and their variable methodological quality limit the applicability of the findings to clinical practice.
<RES> The main limitations include inadequate reporting of outcomes and the methods for allocation, randomisation and blinding; extensive use of self-reported measures to estimate the effects of interventions on a number of outcomes, including weight loss, dietary consumption and physical activity levels; and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to lack of post-intervention assessments.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence to support the use of TTM SOC in weight loss interventions is limited by risk of bias and imprecision, not allowing firm conclusions to be drawn.
<CON> When combined with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions we found very low quality evidence that it might lead to better dietary and physical activity habits.
<CON> This systematic review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs that apply the principles of the TTM SOC appropriately to produce conclusive evidence about the effect of TTM SOC lifestyle interventions on weight loss and other health outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that causes muscle weakness and excessive muscle tiredness.
<ABS> In most people with myasthenia gravis, muscles throughout the body are affected in the first two years after the onset of symptoms, although there is also a form of the disease that affects only the eyes (ocular myasthenia).
<ABS> Myasthenia gravis occurs when the person’s own immune system attacks the vital structures that transmit impulses from nerves to muscle, the neuromuscular junctions.
<ABS> A tumour affecting an immune system organ called the thymus (a thymoma) is sometimes the underlying cause; this is known as thymomatous myasthenia gravis.
<ABS> Thymomatous myasthenia gravis was not the subject of this systematic review as the thymoma should be treated on its own merit, independently of the myasthenia gravis.
<ABS> Some observational studies suggest that removal of the thymus (thymectomy) might be useful in people with myasthenia gravis who do not have a thymoma (non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis).
<ABS> It is generally accepted that thymectomy should not be used in ocular myasthenia, although some people think that it could be used when there is no response to medical therapy.
<ABS> In our systematic review of the evidence we did not find any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of thymectomy in non-thymomatous myasthenia gravis.
<ABS> At present, as there is no RCT, the value of thymectomy is a subject of controversy and medical practice varies among practising physicians.
<ABS> An RCT is required to find out whether thymectomy is effective in generalized myasthenia gravis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Treatments currently used for patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) include steroids, non-steroid immune suppressive agents, plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin and thymectomy.
<INT> Data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) support the use of some of these therapeutic modalities and the evidence for non-surgical therapies are the subject of other Cochrane reviews.
<INT> Significant uncertainty and variation persist in clinical practice regarding the potential role of thymectomy in the treatment of people with MG.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 31 March 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2013) and LILACS (January 1992 to March 2013) for RCTs.
<MaM> Two authors (RS and GC) read all retrieved abstracts and reviewed the full texts of potentially relevant articles.
<MaM> These two authors checked references of all manuscripts identified in the review to identify additional articles that were of relevance and contacted experts in the field to identify additional published and unpublished data.
<MaM> Where necessary, authors were contacted for further information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We did not use measured outcomes as criteria for study selection.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We would have identified any adverse effects of thymectomy from the included trials.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (i.e. corticosteroids) given by mouth or injection (i.e. systemically) compared to placebo or standard clinical care on acute attacks of nose and sinus complaints (i.e. acute sinusitis) in children and adults.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Acute sinusitis may be caused directly by viral or bacterial infections and by the body's inflammatory response to these infections.
<ABS> Therefore, anti-inflammatory treatments may be effective in treating this condition.
<ABS> Earlier reviews found only modest beneficial effects of corticosteroids given by nasal spray.
<ABS> It is unclear if this is because the intranasal corticosteroids did not actually reach the (blocked) nasal passages or because anti-inflammatory drugs do not work.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review included evidence up to 19 February 2014.
<ABS> Five trials involving 1193 participants aged 15 years and older with acute sinusitis were included.
<ABS> In four trials participants received either antibiotics plus oral corticosteroids or antibiotics plus control treatment, while one trial assessed the effects of corticosteroids alone.
<ABS> Information on symptom relief was only available for the short term (two weeks or less) and no trial reported on relapse rates.
<ABS> No data for children were available.
<ABS> Key outcomes
<ABS> After combining trial findings, the results suggest that adults treated with oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics are more likely to have short-term symptom relief than those receiving a placebo or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug plus antibiotics.
<ABS> To benefit a single person, seven would need to receive treatment (number needed to treat to benefit).
<ABS> The trial assessing the effects of oral corticosteroids without antibiotics found no beneficial effects compared to placebo.
<ABS> Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of the evidence for oral corticosteroids plus antibiotics to be low (further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and is likely to change the estimate) as the evidence is derived from four trials, including a relatively low number of participants, with a substantial risk of bias.
<ABS> Evidence of the effect of oral corticosteroids without antibiotics is derived from only one high-quality trial and we therefore judged the quality to be moderate (further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five RCTs with a total of 1193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial.
<RES> Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials.
<RES> However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria.
<RES> All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial).
<RES> In four trials antibiotics were prescribed in addition to oral corticosteroids or control treatment, while one trial investigated the effects of oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy.
<RES> When combining data from the five trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at days three to seven (risk ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6; risk difference (RD) 17%, 95% CI 6% to 29%) and at days four to 14 (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5; RD 14%, 95% CI 1% to 27%).
<RES> A sensitivity analysis including the four trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: at days three to seven (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; RD 11%, 95% CI 4% to 17%) and days four to 14 (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; RD 8%, 95% CI 2% to 13%).
<RES> Statistical heterogeneity was high for many analyses.
<RES> Subgroup analyses revealed that corticosteroid monotherapy had no beneficial effects.
<RES> Furthermore, scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids).
<RES> No trial reported effects on relapse or recurrence rates.
<RES> Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy appear to be ineffective for adult patients with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.
<CON> Current data on the use of oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are limited: almost all trials are performed in secondary care settings and there is a significant risk of bias.
<CON> This limited evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids in combination with antibiotics may be modestly beneficial for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis, with a number needed to treat to benefit of seven for resolution or symptom improvement.
<CON> A large primary care factorial trial is needed to establish whether oral corticosteroids offer additional benefits over antibiotics in acute sinusitis.

<H1> Pharmacological interventions for hypertension in children

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Medications for high blood pressure in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hypertension (high blood pressure) is known to increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure.
<ABS> The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising.
<ABS> A significant proportion of children with hypertension require medication to reduce blood pressure and medication use has increased significantly over the past several years.
<ABS> This systematic review includes 21 trials, involving 3454 children, which evaluated different medications to lower blood pressure among children with hypertension.
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of October 2013.
<ABS> Most trials were of very short duration with the average being seven weeks.
<ABS> The studies were of variable quality and mostly industry funded.
<ABS> Not all studies compared the effect of medication on blood pressure lowering to a placebo.
<ABS> Only a few classes of the commonly prescribed drugs have been evaluated and most had a modest effect on blood pressure, but it is uncertain whether this results in improved long-term outcomes for children.
<ABS> Higher doses of medication did not result in greater reduction of blood pressure.
<ABS> All of the drugs studied were safe for use, at least in the short term.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease and kidney damage in adults.
<INT> There is a paucity of data on the long-term sequelae of persistent hypertension in children, but it is known that children with hypertension have evidence of end organ damage and are at risk of hypertension into adulthood.
<INT> The prevalence of hypertension in children is rising, most likely due to a concurrent rise in obesity rates.
<INT> In children with hypertension, non-pharmacological measures are often recommended as first-line therapy, but a significant proportion of children will eventually require pharmacological treatment to reduce blood pressure, especially those with evidence of end organ damage at presentation or during follow-up.
<INT> A systematic review of the effects of antihypertensive agents in children has not previously been conducted.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The selection criteria were deliberately broad due to there being few clinical trials in children.
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least two weeks duration comparing antihypertensive agents either as monotherapy or combination therapy with either placebo or another medication, or comparing different doses of the same medication, in children with hypertension.
<MaM> Hypertension was defined as an average (over a minimum of three readings) systolic or diastolic blood pressure (or both) on the 95th percentile or above for age, height and gender.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected relevant studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> We summarised data, where possible, using a random-effects model.
<MaM> Formal assessment of heterogeneity was not possible because of insufficient data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No randomised trial was identified that evaluated the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications on target end organ damage.
<RES> The trials were of variable quality and most were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
<RES> Among the angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan (one trial, n = 240), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.50 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.44 to -3.56) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.50 mmHg (95% CI -9.62 to -1.38) (low-quality evidence).
<RES> High dose telmisartan (one trial, n = 76), when compared to placebo, reduced systolic blood pressure by -8.50 (95% CI -13.79 to -3.21) but not diastolic blood pressure (-4.80, 95% CI -9.50 to 0.10) (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Beta blocker (metoprolol, one trial, n = 140), when compared with placebo , significantly reduced systolic blood pressure by 4.20 mmHg (95% CI -8.12 to -0.28) but not diastolic blood pressure (-3.20 mmHg 95% CI -7.12 to 0.72) (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Beta blocker/diuretic combination (Bisoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, one trial, n = 94)when compared with placebo , did not result in a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-4.0 mmHg, 95% CI -8.99 to -0.19) but did have an effect on diastolic blood pressure (-4.50 mmHg, 95% CI -8.26 to -0.74) (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Calcium channel blocker (extended-release felodipine,one trial, n = 133) was not effective in reducing systolic blood pressure (-0.62 mmHg, 95% CI -2.97 to 1.73) or diastolic blood pressure (-1.86 mmHg, 95% CI -5.23 to 1.51) when compared with placebo.
<RES> Further, there was no consistent dose response observed among any of the drug classes.
<RES> The adverse events associated with the antihypertensive agents were mostly minor and included headaches, dizziness and upper respiratory infections.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Overall, there are sparse data informing the use of antihypertensive agents in children, with outcomes reported limited to blood pressure and not end organ damage.
<CON> The most data are available for candesartan, for which there is low-quality evidence of a modest lowering effect on blood pressure.
<CON> We did not find evidence of a consistent dose response relationship for escalating doses of angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
<CON> All agents appear safe, at least in the short term.

<H1> Medical treatment for botulism

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Medical treatment for botulism

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed evidence on the effect of medical treatment on human botulism.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Botulism is a serious illness that starts suddenly and causes paralysis (an inability to use muscles).
<ABS> A germ called Clostridium botulinum is the cause.
<ABS> If left untreated, a lot of people who have botulism die.
<ABS> There are four main types, adult and infant types where the intestine (gut) is infected; botulism from contaminated food; and wound botulism.
<ABS> We assessed the evidence on the effect of medical treatment on human botulism.
<ABS> We searched for clinical trials of medicines for any of the four major types of botulism.
<ABS> We decided to assess the effects of treatment on the rate of deaths in hospital from any cause within four weeks.
<ABS> We were also interested in deaths within 12 weeks, length of hospital stay, the need for a ventilator to help with breathing (mechanical ventilation), feeding by tube, and harmful events.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Once we had searched the medical literature and checked the results, we found only one randomized controlled trial (RCT), which was in infant botulism.
<ABS> The treatment was a single dose of a medicine made from human immune proteins (human-derived botulinum immune globulin or BIG).
<ABS> In the trial, 59 participants received BIG and 63 received an inactive treatment.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in the trial.
<ABS> Infants treated with BIG were in hospital for three weeks less, on average, and spent a shorter time on a ventilator.
<ABS> The average length of tube feeding in the BIG group was over six weeks less than in the control group.
<ABS> The risk of harmful effects was no greater with BIG than with the inactive treatment.
<ABS> The evidence was of high quality overall (moderate for time spent on a ventilator).
<ABS> The review shows that there is evidence for the use of BIG to treat infant botulism.
<ABS> On the other hand, there is no evidence for or against botulism antitoxin or other medical treatments.
<ABS> The evidence was up to date to March 2013, when we updated the searches and found no new trials.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Botulism is an acute paralytic illness caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum.
<INT> Supportive care, including intensive care, is key but the role of other medical treatments is unclear.
<INT> This is an update of a review first published in 2011.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 30 March 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (30 March 2013), CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2013) and EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2013).
<MaM> We reviewed bibliographies and contacted authors and experts.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Potential medical treatments included equine serum trivalent botulism antitoxin, human-derived botulinum immune globulin, plasma exchange, 3,4-diaminopyridine and guanidine.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data onto data extraction forms.
<MaM> Our primary outcome was in-hospital death from any cause occurring within four weeks.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes were death occurring within 12 weeks, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding and risk of adverse events.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A single randomized controlled trial met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> We found no additional trials when we updated the searches in 2013.
<RES> This trial evaluated human-derived botulinum immune globulin (BIG) for the treatment of infant botulism and included 59 treatment participants as well as 63 control participants.
<RES> The control group received a control immune globulin which did not have an effect on botulinum toxin.
<RES> In this trial there was some violation of intention-to-treat principles, and possibly some between-treatment group imbalances among those participants admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated, but overall we judged the risk of bias to be low.
<RES> There were no deaths in either group, making any treatment effect on mortality inestimable.
<RES> There was a significant benefit in the treatment group on mean duration of hospitalization (BIG: 2.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.25; control: 5.70 weeks, 95% CI 4.40 to 7.00; mean difference (MD) 3.10 weeks, 95% CI 1.68 to 4.52), mechanical ventilation (BIG: 1.80 weeks, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.40; control: 4.40 weeks, 95% CI 3.00 to 5.80; MD 2.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.06), and tube or parenteral feeding (BIG: 3.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.50; control: 10.00 weeks, 95% CI 6.85 to 13.15; MD 6.40 weeks, 95% CI 2.80 to 10.00) but not on risk of adverse events or complications (BIG: 63.08%; control: 68.75%; risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18; absolute risk reduction 0.06, 95% CI 0.22 to -0.11).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is evidence supporting the use of human-derived botulinum immune globulin (BIG) in infant intestinal botulism.
<CON> A single randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant decreases in the duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and tube or parenteral feeding with BIG treatment.
<CON> This evidence was of moderate quality for effects on duration of mechanical ventilation but was otherwise of high quality.
<CON> Our search did not reveal any evidence examining the use of other medical treatments including serum trivalent botulism antitoxin.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antiviral treatment for influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis is a genetic, life-threatening disorder affecting multiple organs.
<ABS> People with cystic fibrosis have a higher risk of chronic lung disease.
<ABS> Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications.
<ABS> During a pandemic, flu symptoms may be more severe and complications more frequent.
<ABS> Severe cases of pandemic flu have occurred in people with underlying chronic conditions including people with CF.
<ABS> Although there is no evidence that people with CF are more likely to contract this infection than healthy people, the impact for them could be greater and the outcome worse as the lower respiratory tract is affected more often.
<ABS> These drugs can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
<ABS> We did not find any trials to support or refute the use of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> However, limited data from previous studies have shown that these drugs can be effective in healthy people and may be useful in high-risk populations if used rationally.
<ABS> However, the question of the safety and effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza in people with cystic fibrosis remains unanswered.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cystic fibrosis is the most common, life-threatening, recessively inherited disease of Caucasian populations.
<INT> Morbidity and mortality of cystic fibrosis is related to chronic pulmonary sepsis and its complications by these bacteria.
<INT> Influenza can worsen the course of the disease in cystic fibrosis by increasing the risk of pneumonia and secondary respiratory complications.
<INT> These inhibitors can limit the infection and prevent the spread of the virus.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Most recent search: 08 July 2013.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza infection in people with cystic fibrosis.
<CON> The absence of high level evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions emphasises the need for well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled clinical trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have an increased mortality and morbidity compared to the general population.
<ABS> T2D is characterised by several metabolic defects including impaired insulin secretion and action, causing chronic hyperglycaemia (high glucose levels in the blood).
<ABS> Chronic hyperglycaemia is strongly associated with increased risk of kidney, eye, and nerve complications (microvascular complications) as well as increased risk of stroke, heart disease, and amputations (macrovascular complications).
<ABS> Epidemiological studies suggest that reducing blood glucose in people with T2D may reduce the risk of death and morbidity.
<ABS> However, such studies do not represent a reliable methodology to assess the effects of interventions because of the inherent risk of imbalances (which may be hidden and therefore uncorrectable) between groups, other than those resulting from the interventions.
<ABS> It is still not clear whether targeting more intensive glycaemic control is better than conventional glycaemic control in terms of clinical outcomes based on evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs).
<ABS> In this updated Cochrane systematic review, we identified 28 RCTs comparing intensive glycaemic control versus conventional glycaemic control in participants with T2D.
<ABS> A total of 18,717 participants randomised to intensive glycaemic control and 16,195 to conventional glycaemic control were included in the analyses.
<ABS> The trials were primarily conducted in Europe and Northern America.
<ABS> The mean duration of the intervention period varied from three days to 12.5 years.
<ABS> Only two trials were considered to have low risk of bias; we may, therefore, have evaluated RCTs with high risk of overestimating beneficial effects and underestimating harmful effects.
<ABS> Our analyses did not show any statistically significant reduction in either death from any cause or death from heart disease when targeting intensive glycaemic control compared with conventional control.
<ABS> Intensive glycaemic control seemed to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, amputation of a lower extremity, and microvascular complications while increasing the risk of severe adverse events and hypoglycaemia.
<ABS> Targeting intensive glycaemic control did not appear to change the risk of non-fatal stroke, cardiac revascularization (a procedure to reconstruct damaged heart blood vessels), and peripheral revascularization.
<ABS> Health-related quality of life did not differ significantly when comparing targeting intensive with conventional glycaemic control.
<ABS> There is a need for more powerful RCTs with low risk of bias to guide the choice of targeting intensive versus conventional glycaemic control in patients with T2D.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality compared to the background population.
<INT> Observational studies report an association between reduced blood glucose and reduced risk of both micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with T2D.
<INT> Our previous systematic review of intensive glycaemic control versus conventional glycaemic control was based on 20 randomised clinical trials that randomised 29 ,986 participants with T2D.
<INT> We now report our updated review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> Dichotomous outcomes were assessed by risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Health-related quality of life and costs of intervention were assessed with standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% Cl.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-eight trials with 34,912 T2D participants randomised 18,717 participants to intensive glycaemic control versus 16,195 participants to conventional glycaemic control.
<RES> Only two trials had low risk of bias on all risk of bias domains assessed.
<RES> The duration of the intervention ranged from three days to 12.5 years.
<RES> The number of participants in the included trials ranged from 20 to 11,140.
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences between targeting intensive versus conventional glycaemic control for all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08; 34,325 participants, 24 trials) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21; 34,177 participants, 22 trials).
<RES> Trial sequential analysis showed that a 10% relative risk reduction could be refuted for all-cause mortality.
<RES> Targeting intensive glycaemic control did not show a statistically significant effect on the risks of macrovascular complications as a composite outcome in the random-effects model, but decreased the risks in the fixed-effect model (random RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.02; and fixed RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99; P = 0.02; 32,846 participants, 14 trials).
<RES> Targeting intensive versus conventional glycaemic control seemed to reduce the risks of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.02; 30,417 participants, 14 trials), amputation of a lower extremity (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94; P = 0.02; 11,200 participants, 11 trials), as well as the risk of developing a composite outcome of microvascular diseases (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95; P = 0.0008; 25,927 participants, 6 trials), nephropathy (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95; P = 0.02; 28,096 participants, 11 trials), retinopathy (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92; P = 0.002; 10,300 participants, 9 trials), and the risk of retinal photocoagulation (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97; P = 0.03; 11,212 participants, 8 trials).
<RES> No statistically significant effect of targeting intensive glucose control could be shown on non-fatal stroke, cardiac revascularization, or peripheral revascularization.
<RES> Trial sequential analyses did not confirm a reduction of the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction but confirmed a 10% relative risk reduction in favour of intensive glycaemic control on the composite outcome of microvascular diseases.
<RES> For the remaining microvascular outcomes, trial sequential analyses could not establish firm evidence for a 10% relative risk reduction.
<RES> Targeting intensive glycaemic control significantly increased the risk of mild hypoglycaemia, but substantial heterogeneity was present; severe hypoglycaemia (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.11; 28,794 participants, 12 trials); and serious adverse events (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10; P = 0.007; 24,280 participants, 11 trials).
<RES> Trial sequential analysis for a 10% relative risk increase showed firm evidence for mild hypoglycaemia and serious adverse events and a 30% relative risk increase for severe hypoglycaemia when targeting intensive versus conventional glycaemic control.
<RES> Overall health-related quality of life, as well as the mental and the physical components of health-related quality of life did not show any statistical significant differences.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Although we have been able to expand the number of participants by 16% in this update, we still find paucity of data on outcomes and the bias risk of the trials was mostly considered high.
<CON> Targeting intensive glycaemic control compared with conventional glycaemic control did not show significant differences for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.
<CON> Targeting intensive glycaemic control seemed to reduce the risk of microvascular complications, if we disregard the risks of bias, but increases the risk of hypoglycaemia and serious adverse events.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for chronic pain

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Stimulating the brain without surgery in the management of chronic pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Various devices are available that can electrically stimulate the brain without the need for surgery or any invasive treatment in order to manage chronic pain.
<ABS> There are four main treatment types: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in which the brain is stimulated by a coil applied to the scalp, cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in which electrodes are clipped to the ears or applied to the scalp, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and reduced impedance non-invasive cortical electrostimulation (RINCE) in which electrodes are applied to the scalp.
<ABS> These have been used to try to reduce pain by aiming to alter the activity of the brain, but the efficacy of these treatments is uncertain.
<ABS> This review update included 56 studies: 30 of rTMS, 11 of CES, 14 of tDCS and one of RINCE.
<ABS> We judged only three studies as having a low risk of bias.
<ABS> Low or very low-quality evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS and rTMS applied to pre-frontal areas of the brain are not effective but that a single dose of high-frequency stimulation of the motor cortex area of the brain provides short-term pain relief.
<ABS> This effect appears to be small and may be exaggerated by a number of sources of bias.
<ABS> Studies that gave a course of multiple treatments of rTMS produced conflicting results with no overall effect seen when we pooled the results of these studies.
<ABS> Most studies of rTMS are small and there is substantial variation between studies in terms of the treatment methods used.
<ABS> Low-quality evidence does not suggest that CES or tDCS are effective treatments for chronic pain.
<ABS> A single small study of RINCE provided very low-quality evidence of a short-term effect on pain.
<ABS> For all forms of stimulation the evidence is not conclusive and uncertainty remains.
<ABS> The reporting of side effects varied across the studies.
<ABS> Of the studies that clearly reported side effects, short-lived and minor side effects such as headache, nausea and skin irritation were usually reported both after real and sham stimulation.
<ABS> There were two reports of seizure following real rTMS.
<ABS> While the broad conclusions for rTMS and CES have not changed substantially, the addition of this new evidence and the application of the GRADE system has modified some of our interpretation.
<ABS> Previous readers should re-read this update.
<ABS> More studies of rigorous design and adequate size are required to evaluate accurately all forms of non-invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of chronic pain.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2010, Issue 9.
<INT> Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques aim to induce an electrical stimulation of the brain in an attempt to reduce chronic pain by directly altering brain activity.
<INT> They include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and reduced impedance non-invasive cortical electrostimulation (RINCE).

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To evaluate the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in chronic pain.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (2013, Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS and clinical trials registers.
<MaM> The original search for the review was run in November 2009 and searched all databases from their inception.
<MaM> To identify studies for inclusion in this update we searched from 2009 to July 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted and verified data.
<MaM> Where possible we entered data into meta-analyses.
<MaM> We excluded studies judged as being at high risk of bias from the analysis.
<MaM> We used the GRADE system to summarise the quality of evidence for core comparisons.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included an additional 23 trials (involving 773 participants randomised) in this update, making a total of 56 trials in the review (involving 1710 participants randomised).
<RES> This update included a total of 30 rTMS studies, 11 CES, 14 tDCS and one study of RINCE(the original review included 19 rTMS, eight CES and six tDCS studies).
<RES> We judged only three studies as being at low risk of bias across all criteria.
<RES> Meta-analysis of studies of rTMS (involving 528 participants) demonstrated significant heterogeneity.
<RES> Pre-specified subgroup analyses suggest that low-frequency stimulation is ineffective (low-quality evidence) and that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is ineffective (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> We found a short-term effect on pain of active high-frequency stimulation of the motor cortex in single-dose studies (low-quality evidence, standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.27 to -0.51 P < 0.01)).
<RES> This equates to a 12% (95% CI 8% to 15%) reduction in pain, which does not exceed the pre-established criteria for a minimal clinically important difference (≥ 15%).
<RES> Evidence for multiple-dose studies was heterogenous but did not demonstrate a significant effect (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> For CES (six studies, 270 participants) no statistically significant difference was found between active stimulation and sham (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Analysis of tDCS studies (11 studies, 193 people) demonstrated significant heterogeneity and did not find a significant difference between active and sham stimulation (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Pre-specified subgroup analysis of tDCS applied to the motor cortex (n = 183) did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect and this lack of effect was consistent for subgroups of single or multiple-dose studies.
<RES> One small study (n = 91) at unclear risk of bias suggested a positive effect of RINCE over sham stimulation on pain (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Non-invasive brain stimulation appears to be frequently associated with minor and transient side effects, though there were two reported incidences of seizure related to active rTMS in the included studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Single doses of high-frequency rTMS of the motor cortex may have small short-term effects on chronic pain.
<CON> It is likely that multiple sources of bias may exaggerate this observed effect.
<CON> The effects do not meet the predetermined threshold of minimal clinical significance and multiple-dose studies do not consistently demonstrate effectiveness.
<CON> The available evidence suggests that low-frequency rTMS, rTMS applied to the pre-frontal cortex, CES and tDCS are not effective in the treatment of chronic pain.
<CON> While the broad conclusions for rTMS and CES have not changed substantially, the addition of this new evidence and the application of the GRADE system has modified some of our interpretation and the conclusion regarding the effectiveness of tDCS has changed.
<CON> We recommend that previous readers should re-read this update.
<CON> There is a need for larger, rigorously designed studies, particularly of longer courses of stimulation.
<CON> It is likely that future evidence may substantially impact upon the presented results.

<H1> Pharmacological interventions for prevention or treatment of postoperative pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Regular painkillers in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones.
<ABS> Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year.
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone.
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Laparoscopic surgery is associated with less pain than open surgery for removal of the gallbladder but postoperative pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Administration of painkillers may be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The different types of painkillers include those that decrease the inflammation (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDS), which include drugs that are available over-the-counter such as paracetamol and ibuprofen and other drugs that are not available over-the-counter such as diclofenac; opium-like painkillers such as codeine and morphine, and some painkillers that are used to treat fits but also possess the ability to decrease the pain such as gabapentin and pregabalin.
<ABS> The last two classes of drugs are available only as prescription drugs except for low dose codeine in some countries.
<ABS> The benefits and harms of giving painkillers on a regular basis in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown.
<ABS> We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials for benefits (where people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) and comparative non-randomised studies for treatment-related harms.
<ABS> We compared the regular use of painkillers with no regular use of painkillers (ie, painkillers were administered as and when required) and the different type of painkillers.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 25 randomised clinical trials involving 2505 people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Most participants in the trials were low anaesthetic risk people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The choice of whether the participants received the different painkillers (or not) was determined by a method similar to the toss of coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in people who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> The treatments in all the included trials were aimed at decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy before the participants reported pain.
<ABS> Participants were allowed to take additional painkillers as required in most of the trials.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in three trials (183 participants) that reported deaths.
<ABS> The differences in the serious complications between the groups was imprecise in all the comparisons.
<ABS> None of the trials reported quality of life or the time taken to return to normal activity.
<ABS> The differences in length of hospital stay and the time taken to return to work was imprecise in all the comparisons that reported these.
<ABS> Pain was lower in the participants who received painkillers compared with those who received controls at 4 to 8 hours and at 9 to 24 hours as measured by the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10).
<ABS> This is a modest reduction and is comparable to other methods of pain reduction such as administering local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) during the operation.
<ABS> In summary, different painkillers reduce pain scores in low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the decision to use these drugs has to weigh the clinically small reduction in pain against uncertain evidence of serious adverse events associated with many of these agents.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary.
<ABS> Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The safety and effectiveness of different pharmacological interventions such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and anticonvulsant analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy is unknown.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the benefits and harms of different analgesics in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We considered comparative non-randomised studies with regards to treatment-related harms.
<MaM> We also considered trials that compared one class of drug with another class of drug for this review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors collected the data independently.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 trials with 2505 participants randomised to the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls.
<RES> All the trials were at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> Most trials included only low anaesthetic risk people undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> Participants were allowed to take additional analgesics as required in 24 of the trials.
<RES> The pharmacological interventions in all the included trials were aimed at preventing pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<RES> There were considerable differences in the pharmacological agents used and the methods of administration.
<RES> The estimated effects of the intervention on the proportion of participants who were discharged as day-surgery, the length of hospital stay, or the time taken to return to work were imprecise in all the comparisons in which these outcomes were reported (very low quality evidence).
<RES> There was no mortality in any of the groups in the two trials that reported mortality (183 participants, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Differences in serious morbidity outcomes between the groups were imprecise across all the comparisons (very low quality evidence).
<RES> None of the trials reported patient quality of life or time taken to return to normal activity.
<RES> The pain at 4 to 8 hours was generally reduced by about 1 to 2 cm on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence).
<RES> The pain at 9 to 24 hours was generally reduced by about 0.5 cm (a modest reduction) on the visual analogue scale of 1 to 10 cm in the comparisons involving the different pharmacological agents and inactive controls (low or very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is evidence of very low quality that different pharmacological agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, and anticonvulsant analgesics reduce pain scores in people at low anaesthetic risk undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> However, the decision to use these drugs has to weigh the clinically small reduction in pain against uncertain evidence of serious adverse events associated with many of these agents.
<CON> Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Endoscopic release for carpal tunnel syndrome

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endoscopic release for carpal tunnel syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about how safe and effective endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) is, compared to any other type of surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> CTS is the most common cause of nerve compression in the arm.
<ABS> The carpal tunnel is the space between a ligament that stretches across the wrist and the bones below.
<ABS> In CTS there is increased pressure on a nerve (the median nerve) as it passes over the wrist towards the palm of the hand through the carpal tunnel.
<ABS> To release the pressure on the nerve in the carpal tunnel, surgeons cut the ligament.
<ABS> This operation can be done as traditional ‘open’ surgery (OCTR), or through an endoscope (ECTR), using a small camera with one or two small cuts in the skin.
<ABS> We searched widely for trials that compared ECTR with other types of surgery.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found 28 studies, involving 2586 people, that were suitable for the review.
<ABS> We considered results at less than three months and more than three months after surgery.
<ABS> Key results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> With support from low quality evidence only, OCTR and ECTR are about as effective as each other in relieving symptoms and improving hand function in CTS.
<ABS> ECTR probably has lower rates of minor complications (such as scar pain and infections) than OCTR but similar rates of major complications.
<ABS> ECTR also allows a faster return to work or daily activities.
<ABS> However, limitations in the studies in this review limit the quality of this evidence.
<ABS> Only one study declared a conflict of interest and nine studies clearly reported no conflict of interest.
<ABS> Four studies were funded from an academic source.
<ABS> Evaluation following the GRADE assessment reveals a low to moderate quality of evidence for the outcomes provided.
<ABS> The evidence in the review is current to November 2012.
<ABS> We re-ran the search shortly before publication and we will fully assess three further studies from this search when the review is updated.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compressive neuropathy of the upper extremity.
<INT> It is caused by increased pressure on the median nerve between the transverse carpal ligament and the carpal bones.
<INT> Surgical treatment consists of the release of the nerve by cutting the transverse carpal ligament.
<INT> This can be done either with an open approach or endoscopically.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness and safety of the endoscopic techniques of carpal tunnel release compared to any other surgical intervention for the treatment of CTS.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> This review fully incorporates the results of searches conducted up to 5 November 2012, when we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE.
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.
<MaM> We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted trial authors.
<MaM> We also searched trial registers for ongoing trials.
<MaM> We performed a preliminary screen of searches to November 2013 to identify any additional recent publications.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-eight studies (2586 hands) were included.
<RES> Twenty-three studies compared ECTR to standard open carpal tunnel release (OCTR), five studies compared ECTR with OCTR using a modified incision, and two studies used a three-arm design to compare ECTR, standard OCTR and modified OCTR.
<RES> At short-term follow-up (three months or less), only one study provided data for overall improvement.
<RES> We found no differences on the Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.13, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.21) or on the Functional Status Scale (FSS) (scale zero to five) (five studies, SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.14) within three months postoperatively between ECTR and OCTR.
<RES> Pain scores favoured ECTR over conventional OCTR (two studies, SMD -0.41, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.18).
<RES> No difference was found between ECTR and OCTR (standard and modified) when pain was assessed on non-continuous dichotomous scales (five studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.45).
<RES> Also, no difference was found in numbness (five studies, RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.71).
<RES> Grip strength was increased after ECTR when compared with OCTR (six studies, SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63).
<RES> This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of 4 kg (95% CI 1 to 6.9 kg) when compared with OCTR, which is probably not clinically significant.
<RES> In the long term (more than three months postoperatively) there was no significant difference in overall improvement between ECTR and OCTR (four studies, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14).
<RES> SSS and FSS were also similar in both treatment groups (two studies, MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.22 for SSS and MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.16 for FSS).
<RES> ECTR and OCTR did not differ in the long term in pain (six studies, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.38) or in numbness (four studies, RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.35).
<RES> Results from grip strength testing favoured ECTR (two studies, SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.71), corresponding to an MD of 11 kg (95% CI 6.2 to 18.81).
<RES> Participants treated with ECTR returned to work or daily activities eight days earlier than participants treated with OCTR (four studies, MD -8.10 days, 95% CI -14.28 to -1.92 days).
<RES> Both treatments were equally safe with only a few reports of major complications (mainly with complex regional pain syndrome) (15 studies, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.64).
<RES> ECTR resulted in a significantly lower rate of minor complications (18 studies, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.81), corresponding to a 45% relative drop in the probability of complications (95% CI 62% to 19%).
<RES> ECTR more frequently resulted in transient nerve problems (ie, neurapraxia, numbness, and paraesthesiae), while OCTR had more wound problems (ie, infection, hypertrophic scarring, and scar tenderness).
<RES> ECTR was safer than OCTR when the total number of complications were assessed (20 studies, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 90) representing a relative drop in the probability by 40% (95% CI 60% to 10%).
<RES> Rates of recurrence of symptoms and the need for repeated surgery were comparable between ECTR and OCTR groups.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in studies that contribute data to these results is rather high; fewer than 25% of the included studies had adequate allocation concealment, generation of allocation sequence or blinding of the outcome assessor.
<RES> The quality of evidence in this review may be considered as generally low.
<RES> Five of the studies were presented only as abstracts, with insufficient information to judge their risk of bias.
<RES> In selection bias, attrition bias or other bias (baseline differences and financial conflict of interest) we could not reach a safe judgement regarding a high or low risk of bias.
<RES> Blinding of participants is impossible due to the nature of interventions.
<RES> We identified three further potentially eligible studies upon updating searches just prior to publication.
<RES> These compared ECTR with OCTR (two studies) or mini-open carpal tunnel release (one study) and will be fully assessed when we update the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> ECTR appears to be associated with fewer minor complications compared to OCTR, but we found no difference in the rates of major complications.
<CON> Return to work is faster after endoscopic release, by eight days on average.
<CON> Conclusions from this review are limited by the high risk of bias, statistical imprecision and inconsistency in the included studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to compare the safety and effectiveness of water-based exercise (but not swimming) training in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) versus no exercise or a different kind of exercise in terms of exercise capacity and quality of life.
<ABS> Water-based exercise training is an alternative mode of physical exercise training that may appeal to the older population, those who are unable to complete land-based exercise programmes and people with COPD who also have other physical and medical conditions.
<ABS> We did not include swimming interventions.
<ABS> Study characteristics: Five studies were identified up to August 2013.
<ABS> These studies included a total of 176 participants, with 71 people participating in water-based exercise training, 54 people participating in land-based exercise training and 51 people completing no exercise training.
<ABS> The average age of participants ranged from 57 to 73 years.
<ABS> The water-based exercise training programmes varied from four to 12 weeks in duration with attendance two to three times a week for between 35 and 90 minutes.
<ABS> The most common types of exercises were walking and cycling-type movements in the water, as well as strength training, most often using floats to increase the intensity.
<ABS> Little information was provided to show whether these effects last for a long time after training has ceased.
<ABS> The effect that severity of COPD may have on benefits of water-based exercise training needs further examination.
<ABS> Two studies reported on adverse events; one minor adverse event was documented (from 20 people participating in water-based exercise training).
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The quality of evidence contributing to these results was generally low to moderate.
<ABS> This was mainly a result of poor study design and not enough data.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Land-based exercise training improves exercise capacity and quality of life in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Handsearching was done to identify further qualifying studies from reference lists of relevant studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Swimming was excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five studies were included with a total of 176 participants (71 people participated in water-based exercise training and 54 in land-based exercise training; 51 completed no exercise training).
<RES> All studies compared supervised water-based exercise training versus land-based exercise training and/or no exercise training in people with COPD (with average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) %predicted ranging from 39% to 62%).
<RES> Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 53 participants.
<RES> The exercise training programmes lasted from four to 12 weeks, and the mean age of participants ranged from 57 to 73 years.
<RES> A moderate risk of bias was due to lack of reporting of randomisation, allocation and blinding procedures in some studies, as well as small sample sizes.
<RES> Compared with no exercise, water-based exercise training improved the six-minute walk distance (mean difference (MD) 62 metres; 95% confidence interval (CI) 44 to 80 metres; three studies; 99 participants; moderate quality evidence), the incremental shuttle walk distance (MD 50 metres; 95% CI 20 to 80 metres; one study; 30 participants; high quality evidence) and the endurance shuttle walk distance (MD 371 metres; 95% CI 121 to 621 metres; one study; 30 participants; high quality evidence).
<RES> Quality of life was also improved after water-based exercise training compared with no exercise (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.97, 95% CI -0.37 to -1.57; two studies; 49 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> Compared with land-based exercise training, water-based exercise training did not significantly change the six-minute walk distance (MD 11 metres; 95% CI -11 to 33 metres; three studies; 62 participants; moderate quality evidence) or the incremental shuttle walk distance (MD 9 metres; 95% CI -15 to 34 metres; two studies; 59 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> However, the endurance shuttle walk distance improved following water-based exercise training compared with land-based exercise training (MD 313 metres; 95% CI 232 to 394 metres; two studies; 59 participants; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Only one study reported long-term outcomes after water-based exercise training for quality of life and body composition, and no significant change was observed between baseline results and six-month follow-up results.
<RES> One minor adverse event was reported for water-based exercise training (based on reporting from two studies; 20 participants).
<RES> Impact of disease severity could not be examined because data were insufficient.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is limited quality evidence that water-based exercise training is safe and improves exercise capacity and quality of life in people with COPD immediately after training.
<CON> Little evidence exists examining the long-term effect of water-based exercise training.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with mental health problems often have complex and long-term difficulties with their physical health such as weight gain, smoking and heart problems.
<ABS> They sometimes do not take care of themselves, have inactive lifestyles and may not be able to cope with daily life or work.
<ABS> People with mental health problems have higher rates of diabetes, lung disease, cancer, heart problems, HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases.
<ABS> Physical health care monitoring can take a variety of forms from simple checks carried out by the person themselves to complex specific health checks carried out by health professionals.
<ABS> Monitoring helps identify current health problems and also anticipate future health problems.
<ABS> In August 2006 the United Kingdom’s Department of Health issued guidance on how to provide better care for the physical health needs of people with serious mental illness.
<ABS> Spearhead Trusts, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and other organisations all promoted the use of physical health care monitoring for people with mental health problems.
<ABS> This review intended to find evidence to support this guidance.
<ABS> The authors’ conclude that current guidance and practice on physical health monitoring lacks a firm basis in research and there is little evidence to support this growing trend.
<ABS> They based their conclusions on results from a search carried out for trials in 2012 which found no relevant randomised studies.
<ABS> Current monitoring is mainly based on the agreement of experts, medical experience and good intentions.
<ABS> This does not mean that physical health monitoring is invalid, wrong or not of benefit to the physical health of people with severe mental illness, only that there is as yet no definite proof.
<ABS> Physical health care monitoring has the potential and promise to improve quality of life and help people with mental health problems live longer, but at this stage the information is uncertain and the research evidence unclear.
<ABS> This summary has been written by a consumer, Benjamin Gray, from Rethink Mental Illness.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Initially, review authors (GT, AC, SM) independently screened the search results and identified three studies as possibly fulfilling the review's criteria.
<MaM> On examination, however, all three were subsequently excluded.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified one ongoing study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is still no evidence from randomised trials to support or refute current guidance and practice.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation for improving automobile driving after stroke

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Driving rehabilitation for stroke

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> After stroke, many people have limitations in their driving ability because of problems with movement, seeing and responding to hazards.
<ABS> Two approaches to treatment have been used.
<ABS> The first approach involves retraining the underlying skills of movement, thinking and sensing.
<ABS> The second approach involves using driving simulators and on-road driving practice in the form of lessons, which aim to improve the driver's skills.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified four studies, up to October 2013, which involved 245 people after stroke.
<ABS> A wide range of interventions was used, including driving simulation, training on devices to improve speed of processing information, scanning and movement.
<ABS> All studies compared the effectiveness of the driving intervention on improving whether drivers passed or failed on a driving assessment.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no evidence that a driving intervention was more effective than no intervention.
<ABS> One trial found that training on a driving simulator resulted in improved performance on a test of recognising road signs immediately after training.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Results should be interpreted with caution, as this was a single study.
<ABS> Further trials involving large numbers of participants, grouped according to their impairments and stroke type are required.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials register (August 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to October 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October 2013), and six additional databases.
<MaM> To identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, searched trials and research registers, checked reference lists and contacted key researchers in the area.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The primary outcome of interest was the performance in an on-road assessment after training.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included assessments of vision, cognition and driving behaviour.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials based on pre-defined inclusion criteria, extracted the data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> A third review author moderated disagreements as required.
<MaM> The review authors contacted all investigators to obtain missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials involving 245 participants in the review.
<RES> Study sample sizes were generally small, and interventions, controls and outcome measures varied, and thus it was inappropriate to pool studies.
<RES> Included studies were at a low risk of bias for the majority of domains, with a high/unclear risk of bias identified in the areas of: performance (participants not blinded to allocation), and attrition (incomplete outcome data due to withdrawal) bias.
<RES> Intervention approaches included the contextual approach of driving simulation and underlying skill development approach, including the retraining of speed of visual processing and visual motor skills.
<RES> The studies were conducted with people who were relatively young and the timing after stroke was varied.
<RES> Primary outcome: there was no clear evidence of improved on-road scores immediately after training in any of the four studies, or at six months (mean difference 15 points on the Test Ride for Investigating Practical Fitness to Drive - Belgian version, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 4.56 to 34.56, P value = 0.15, one study, 83 participants).
<RES> Secondary outcomes: road sign recognition was better in people who underwent training compared with control (mean difference 1.69 points on the Road Sign Recognition Task of the Stroke Driver Screening Assessment, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.87, P value = 0.007, one study, 73 participants).
<RES> Significant findings were in favour of a simulator-based driving rehabilitation programme (based on one study with 73 participants) but these results should be interpreted with caution as they were based on a single study.
<RES> Adverse effects were not reported.
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the effects on vision, other measures of cognition, motor and functional activities, and driving behaviour with the intervention.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the use of rehabilitation to improve on-road driving skills after stroke.
<CON> We found limited evidence that the use of a driving simulator may be beneficial in improving visuocognitive abilities, such as road sign recognition that are related to driving.
<CON> Moreover, we were unable to find any RCTs that evaluated on-road driving lessons as an intervention.
<CON> At present, it is unclear which impairments that influence driving ability after stroke are amenable to rehabilitation, and whether the contextual or remedial approaches, or a combination of both, are more efficacious.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are orthodontic appliances in moving the upper teeth backwards in children and adolescents.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Orthodontic treatment is a type of dental care that corrects crooked or sticking out teeth by moving the teeth into different positions.
<ABS> When orthodontic treatment is provided with braces it is sometimes necessary to move the upper molar teeth backwards (distalise).
<ABS> This is achieved by special types of braces (appliances) that are placed either before or at the same time as the normal braces.
<ABS> Appliances which move the upper molar teeth backwards can be placed inside the mouth (intraoral appliance) or attached to the back of the head (extraoral appliance).
<ABS> The most commonly used extraoral appliance is headgear.
<ABS> The biggest disadvantage of headgear is that children and adolescents must wear it for prolonged hours during the day.
<ABS> In addition, serious eye injuries have been reported while wearing headgear.
<ABS> As an alternative, several intraoral appliances have been developed.
<ABS> Unfortunately, their effects have not been completely evaluated.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, and the evidence is current as of December 2012.
<ABS> In this review there are 10 studies published between 2005 and 2011 in which a total of 354 children were randomised to receive treatment with a distalising orthodontic appliance and compared to either no treatment, headgear or another distalising appliance.
<ABS> The age range of children in nine of the studies was from 11 to 15 years, although the children recruited to one study were younger, from nine to 10 years old.
<ABS> Both girls and boys participated in the studies.
<ABS> Where it was mentioned, the funding was from a university or dental research foundation.
<ABS> The authors did not assess the impact of the funding sources.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When intraoral appliances are compared to headgear they will probably move the upper molar teeth backwards more than headgear.
<ABS> However, the use of intraoral appliances was also associated with movement of the upper front teeth when compared to extraoral appliances in four studies.
<ABS> This is an unwanted effect that was not observed with the use of the headgear appliances.
<ABS> Harm, injury from the appliances and other characteristics of the appliances which may be important to patients were not reported in the studies.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The evidence presented is generally of low quality.
<ABS> The main shortcomings were related to trial design.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> When orthodontic treatment is provided with fixed appliances, it is sometimes necessary to move the upper molar teeth backwards (distalise) to create space or help to overcome anchorage requirements.
<INT> This can be achieved with the use of extraoral or intraoral appliances.
<INT> The most common appliance is extraoral headgear, which requires considerable patient co-operation.
<INT> Further, reports of serious injuries have been published.
<INT> Intraoral appliances have been developed to overcome such shortcomings.
<INT> The comparative effects of extraoral and intraoral appliances have not been fully evaluated.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of orthodontic treatment for distalising upper first molars in children and adolescents.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 10 December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 10 December 2012) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 10 December 2012).
<MaM> No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> We performed data extraction and assessment of the risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We contacted authors to clarify the inclusion criteria of the studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies, reporting data from 354 participants, were included in this review, the majority of which were carried out in a university dental hospital setting.
<RES> The studies were published between 2005 and 2011 and were conducted in Europe and in Brazil.
<RES> The age range of participants was from nine to 15 years, with an even distribution of males and females in seven of the studies, and a slight predominance of female patients in three of the studies.
<RES> The quality of the studies was generally poor; seven studies were at an overall high risk of bias, three studies were at an unclear risk of bias, and we judged no study to be at low risk of bias.
<RES> We carried out random-effects meta-analyses as appropriate for the primary clinical outcomes of movement of upper first molars (mm), and loss of anterior anchorage, where there were sufficient data reported in the primary studies.
<RES> Four studies, involving 159 participants, compared a distalising appliance to an untreated control.
<RES> Meta-analyses were not undertaken for all primary outcomes due to incomplete reporting of all summary statistics, expected outcomes, and differences between the types of appliances.
<RES> The degree and direction of molar movement and loss of anterior anchorage varied with the type of appliance.
<RES> Four studies, involving 150 participants, compared a distalising appliance versus headgear.
<RES> The mean molar movement for intraoral distalising appliances was -2.20 mm and -1.04 mm for headgear.
<RES> There was a statistically significant difference in mean distal molar movement (mean difference (MD) -1.45 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.74 to -0.15) favouring intraoral appliances compared to headgear (four studies, high or unclear risk of bias, 150 participants analysed).
<RES> However, a statistically significant difference in mean mesial upper incisor movement (MD 1.82 mm; 95% CI 1.39 to 2.24) and overjet (fixed-effect: MD 1.64 mm; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.02; two studies, unclear risk of bias, 70 participants analysed) favoured headgear, i.e. there was less loss of anterior anchorage with headgear.
<RES> We reported direct comparisons of intraoral appliances narratively due to the variation in interventions (three studies, high or unclear risk of bias, 93 participants randomised).
<RES> All appliances were reported to provide some degree of distal movement, and loss of anterior anchorage varied with the type of appliance.
<RES> No included studies reported on the incidence of adverse effects (harm, injury), number of attendances or rate of non-compliance.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It is suggested that intraoral appliances are more effective than headgear in distalising upper first molars.
<CON> However, this effect is counteracted by loss of anterior anchorage, which was not found to occur with headgear when compared with intraoral distalising appliance in a small number of studies.
<CON> The number of trials assessing the effects of orthodontic treatment for distilisation is low, and the current evidence is of low or very low quality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stomach cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.
<ABS> Surgery is the only curative treatment offered to patients suffering from this cancer.
<ABS> Survival rates, however, are still poor.
<ABS> Chemotherapy given after surgery has been developed in order to improve these results.
<ABS> We identified 34 trials with 7824 patients which randomised patients to surgery with post-surgical chemotherapy versus surgery alone.
<ABS> The group who received chemotherapy had a survival benefit and improvement in disease free survival (15% and 21%, respectively), although all the trials had a high risk of bias.
<ABS> There was no significant difference due to the stage of disease or the chemotherapy agent used.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> For gastric cancer surgery is the mainstay treatment.
<INT> Chemotherapy seems to improve the survival results.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded (July 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using the RevMan analysis software.
<MaM> We calculated the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on intention-to-treat or available case analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The authors identified 34 studies (7824 patients) reporting overall survival (OS) and only 15 reporting disease free survival (DFS) as well.
<RES> Post-surgical chemotherapy showed an improvement in OS (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.90) and an improvement in DFS (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.87), although all the trials had a high risk of bias.
<RES> The planned analysis of quality of life, return to work, and number of hospital admissions was impossible to complete as the outcome data for the analysis were not available from any trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Post-surgical chemotherapy should be used routinely for resectable gastric cancer where possible.
<CON> Further RCTs are needed to determine the role at each stage of disease.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We compared the benefits and harms of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and endothelial keratoplasty (EK) in people with Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) to determine whether one is more effective or safer than the other.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The innermost layer (endothelial cell layer) of the cornea (transparent front of the eye) is essential for maintaining corneal transparency by pumping fluid out and preventing swelling, which leads to opacification.
<ABS> FED is a disease caused by premature degeneration of the endothelial cells leading to fluid in the cornea (oedema), blisters on the surface of the eye (bullous keratopathy) and blurred vision.
<ABS> Severe cases can be treated by corneal transplants, which can be broadly classified into the two types of procedures of PKP (the central cornea is replaced using full thickness corneal tissue from a deceased donor) and EK (where only the innermost layer of the cornea is transplanted).
<ABS> The EK procedure can be performed using several methods such as deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK), Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) or femtosecond laser-assisted endothelial keratoplasty (FLEK).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found three randomised controlled trials that compared EK with PKP, one of which used the FLEK method.
<ABS> The evidence was current to January 2014.
<ABS> The three trials enrolled a total of 139 eyes of 136 participants, of which 123 eyes were included in the final analyses.
<ABS> The trial on FLEK and PKP was conducted from 2005 to 2007 in the Netherlands; the other two trials were conducted in the United States and were reported in 2008 and 2009 but the study dates were not specified.
<ABS> Over 70% of the included participants were diagnosed with FED, and the remaining participants had other ocular conditions.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between the two groups in one study at 12 months and another at 24 months.
<ABS> Chances of having an irregular shape of the front of the cornea (astigmatism) was less but endothelial cell loss was higher following EK procedures than after PKP.
<ABS> Only one trial reported harms of the interventions, and indicated that FLEK may result in slightly more complications than PKP (for example, 8% graft failure in the FLEK group versus none in the PKP group; and 3% graft rejection in the FLEK group versus 2% in the PKP group).
<ABS> No trials reported information about quality of life or economic data.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was not high due to some limitations with the study designs and because all trials had small numbers of participants with FED.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FED) is a condition in which there is premature degeneration of corneal endothelial cells.
<INT> When the number of endothelial cells is reduced to a significant degree, fluid begins to accumulate within the cornea.
<INT> As a result, the cornea loses its transparency and the individual suffers a reduction in vision.
<INT> The only successful surgical treatment for this condition is replacement of part or all of the cornea with healthy tissue from a donor.
<INT> The established procedure, penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), has been used for many years and its safety and efficacy are well known.
<INT> Endothelial keratoplasty (EK) techniques are relatively new surgical procedures and their safety and efficacy relative to PKP are uncertain.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
<MaM> There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> The electronic databases were last searched on 27 January 2014.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three RCTs that enrolled a total of 139 eyes of 136 participants and analysed 123 (88%) eyes.
<RES> Two RCTs randomised eyes into either the endothelial keratoplasty (EK) group or penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) group and one RCT randomised eyes into either the femtosecond laser-assisted endothelial keratoplasty (FLEK) group or PKP group.
<RES> The RCTs comparing EK with PKP did not show any significant differences between procedures with respect to best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at two years (mean difference (MD) 0.14 logMAR; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.08 to 0.36; P = 0.23) or at one year (MD 0.09 logMAR; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.23; P = 0.22), whereas the trial comparing FLEK with PKP showed significantly better BCVA after PKP (MD 0.20 logMAR; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.30; P = 0.0001).
<RES> Only one RCT reported on irregular astigmatism (higher-order aberration), which was less with EK than PKP (MD -1.20 µm; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.87; P < 0.001).
<RES> Only one RCT reported on endothelial cell counts (lower after FLEK than PKP: MD -969 cells/mm²; 95% CI -1161 to -777; P < 0.001), primary graft failure (higher after FLEK than PKP: RR 7.76; 95% CI 0.41 to 145.22; P = 0.10), and graft rejection (more after FLEK than PKP: RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.07 to 17.12; P = 0.94).
<RES> Only one RCT reported that 27.8% of participants had graft dislocation, 2.8% had epithelial ingrowth and postoperative pupillary block, and 13.9% had intraocular pressure (IOP)-related problems in the FLEK group compared with the PKP group, in whom 10% had suture-related problems, 5% had wound dehiscence and 10% had suture revision to correct astigmatism.
<RES> Overall, the adverse events in the FLEK group appeared to be more frequent than in the PKP group.
<RES> No trials reported information about quality of life or economic data.
<RES> The overall methodological quality of the three trials was not satisfactory as most did not perform allocation concealment or masking of participants and outcome assessors, and all trials had a small sample size.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The rapid growth of endothelial keratoplasty as the treatment of choice for FED is based upon the belief that visual recovery is more rapid, surgically induced astigmatism (regular and irregular) is less and rates of transplant rejection are lower with EK.
<CON> This change in practice also assumes that the rates of long term transplant survival are equal for the two procedures.
<CON> The practical differences between the surgical procedures mean that visual recovery is inherently more rapid following EK, but this review found no strong evidence from RCTs of any difference in the final visual outcome between EK and PKP for people with FED.
<CON> This review also found that higher order aberrations are fewer following EK but endothelial cell loss is greater following EK.
<CON> The RCTs that we included employed different EK techniques, which may have a bearing on these findings.
<CON> EK procedures have evolved over the years and can be performed using different techniques, for example deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty, Descemets stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK), Descemets stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), femtosecond laser-assisted endothelial keratoplasty and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).
<CON> More RCTs are needed to compare PKP with commonly performed EK procedures such as DSEK, DSAEK and DMEK in order to determine the answers to two key questions, whether there is any difference in the final visual outcome between these techniques and whether there are differences in the rates of graft survival in the long term?


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Newborns wearing only a diaper being held next to their mother's bare chest is referred to as skin-to-skin contact and is also sometimes called Kangaroo Care because of its similarity to the way kangaroo mothers care for their young.
<ABS> Newborns, especially those who must spend time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, must have various tests and procedures as part of their care, for example, heel stick, vein puncture, and injections.
<ABS> Giving analgesic drugs for these procedures can often pose problems so that alternatives to drugs must be found.
<ABS> Kangaroo Care appears to reduce the pain response to these frequent procedures, although few studies could be combined to provide strong evidence.
<ABS> As far as it has been reported, Kangaroo Care is safe.
<ABS> Nineteen studies were examined which showed that signs of pain, with a combination of physical and behavioural signs, support the use of Kangaroo Care.
<ABS> Physiological indicators of pain, such as heart rate, did not show a significant difference.
<ABS> Although we believe that Kangaroo Care is effective the size of the benefit may not be large.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The secondary objectives were to determine the incidence of untoward effects of SSC and to compare the SSC effect in different postmenstrual age subgroups of infants.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Collaborative Review Group were used.
<MaM> Searches were conducted throughout September 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The main outcome measures were physiological or behavioural pain indicators and composite pain scores.
<MaM> A weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model was reported for continuous outcome measures.
<MaM> We included variations on type of tissue-damaging procedure, provider of care, and duration of SSC.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen studies (n = 1594 infants) were included.
<RES> Fifteen studies (n = 744) used heel lance as the painful procedure, one study combined venepuncture and heel stick (n = 50), two used intramuscular injection, and one used 'vaccination' (n = 80).
<RES> The studies that were included were generally strong and free from bias.
<RES> Eleven studies (n = 1363) compared SSC alone to a no-treatment control.
<RES> Although 11 studies measured heart rate during painful procedures, data from only four studies (n = 121) could be combined to give a mean difference (MD) of 0.35 beats per minute (95% CI -6.01 to 6.71).
<RES> Three other studies that were not included in meta-analyses also reported no difference in heart rate after the painful procedure.
<RES> Two studies reported heart rate variability outcomes and found no significant differences.
<RES> Five studies used the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) as a primary outcome, which favoured SCC at 30 seconds (n = 268) (MD -3.21, 95% CI -3.94 to -2.48), 60 seconds (n = 164) (MD -1.85, 95% CI -3.03 to -0.68), and 90 seconds (n = 163) (MD -1.34, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.13), but at 120 seconds (n = 157) there was no difference.
<RES> No studies provided findings on return of heart rate to baseline level, oxygen saturation, cortisol levels, duration of crying, and facial actions that could be combined for analysis.
<RES> Eight studies compared SSC to another intervention with or without a no-treatment control.
<RES> Two cross-over studies (n = 80) compared mother versus other provider on PIPP scores at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds with no significant difference.
<RES> When SSC was compared to other interventions, there were not enough similar studies to pool results in an analysis.
<RES> One study compared SSC with and without dextrose and found that the combination was most effective and that SSC alone was more effective than dextrose alone.
<RES> Similarly, in another study SSC was more effective than oral glucose for heart rate but not oxygen saturation.
<RES> SSC either in combination with breastfeeding or alone was favoured over a no-treatment control, but was not different to breastfeeding.
<RES> There were not enough participants with similar outcomes and painful procedures to compare age groups or duration of SSC.
<RES> No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Physiological indicators were typically not different between conditions.
<CON> Only two studies compared mother providers to others, with non-significant results.
<CON> There was more heterogeneity in the studies with behavioural or composite outcomes.
<CON> There is a need for replication studies that use similar, clearly defined outcomes.
<CON> New studies examining optimal duration of SSC, gestational age groups, repeated use, and long-term effects of SSC are needed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Hormonal contraceptives for contraception in overweight or obese women

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Excess body weight has become a problem around the world.
<ABS> We looked at studies of hormonal birth control for women who were overweight or obese compared to women of normal weight or body mass index (BMI).
<ABS> The formula for BMI is weight (kg) / height (m)2.
<ABS> Though January 2013, we did computer searches for studies of hormonal birth control among women who were overweight or obese.
<ABS> We wrote to researchers to find other studies we might have missed.
<ABS> All types of studies were considered.
<ABS> We found 9 reports with data from 13 trials and 49,712 women.
<ABS> Five reports from 2002 to 2012 compared BMI groups.
<ABS> Only one found more pregnancies among overweight or obese women using one of the combined birth control pills.
<ABS> The other groups compared were not very different.
<ABS> Another study of a birth control pill found no trend with higher weight or BMI.
<ABS> Among skin patch users, more pregnancies were found among women weighing 80 kg or more.
<ABS> However, the researchers reported that BMI was not related to pregnancy.
<ABS> An implant study had one pregnancy and an injectable study reported none.
<ABS> Studies from the 1990s used weight alone rather than BMI.
<ABS> Results were mixed.
<ABS> Two studies showed women weighing 70 kg or more had more pregnancies than those weighing less than 70 kg.
<ABS> They examined an early vaginal ring (never marketed) and a six-rod implant.
<ABS> Two implant studies showed the body weight groups to be similar for pregnancy.
<ABS> These studies did not generally show that BMI was related to how well hormonal methods work.
<ABS> BMI reflects the body fat while weight shows overall body size.
<ABS> Of five studies using BMI, only one found more pregnancies among overweight or obese women using one type of birth control pill.
<ABS> The other four studies examined another birth control pill, a patch, an implant, and an injectable.
<ABS> BMI might not affect how well implants and injectable methods work to prevent pregnancy.
<ABS> The recent studies were moderate quality and the older ones were low quality for this review.
<ABS> The birth control methods studied here are very effective when the directions are followed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Obesity has reached epidemic proportions around the world.
<INT> Effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be related to metabolic changes in obesity or greater body mass or body fat.
<INT> Hormonal contraceptives mainly include oral contraceptives, injectables and implants, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring.
<INT> We systematically reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives among overweight and obese women.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Through January 2013, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP.
<MaM> The previous search also included EMBASE.
<MaM> We contacted investigators to identify other trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All study designs were eligible.
<MaM> Any type of hormonal contraceptive could have been examined.
<MaM> Reports had to contain information on the specific contraceptive method(s).
<MaM> The primary outcome was pregnancy.
<MaM> Overweight or obese women must have been identified by an analysis cutoff for weight or BMI (kg/m2).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were abstracted by two authors.
<MaM> Life-table rates were included where available.
<MaM> For dichotomous variables, we computed an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI).
<MaM> We used reported pregnancy rates or relative risk (RR) when those were the only results provided.
<MaM> The main comparisons were between overweight or obese women and women of lower weight or BMI.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of evidence for this review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found nine reports with data from 13 trials that included a total of 49,712 women.
<RES> Five reports from 2002 to 2012 compared BMI groups; of those, one reported a higher pregnancy risk for overweight or obese women.
<RES> In that trial, women assigned to an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone acetate 1.0 mg plus EE 20 µg and having a BMI at least 25 had greater pregnancy risk compared to those with BMI less than 25 (reported RR 2.49; 95% CI 1.01 to 6.13).
<RES> The comparisons reported in the other four studies were not significantly different for pregnancy.
<RES> These included studies of a combined oral contraceptive (COC), a transdermal patch, an implant, and an injectable.
<RES> The COC study showed no trend by BMI or weight.
<RES> With the transdermal patch, body weight was associated with pregnancy (reported P < 0.001) but BMI was not.
<RES> The implant study had one pregnancy and the injectable study reported no pregnancies.
<RES> Four studies from the 1990s used weight alone rather than BMI.
<RES> Results were mixed.
<RES> Studies of a vaginal ring (never marketed) and a six-rod implant showed higher pregnancy rates for women weighing at least 70 kg versus those weighing less than 70 kg (reported P values: 0.0013 and < 0.05, respectively).
<RES> However, two implant studies showed no trend by body weight.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence did not generally show an association of BMI with effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.
<CON> However, the evidence was limited for any individual contraceptive method.
<CON> Studies using BMI (rather than weight alone) can provide more information about whether body composition is related to contraceptive effectiveness.
<CON> The efficacy of subdermal implants and injectable contraceptives may be unaffected by body mass.
<CON> The contraceptive methods examined here are among the most effective when the recommended regimen is followed.
<CON> The overall quality of evidence was low for this review.
<CON> More recent reports provided moderate quality evidence, while the older studies provided evidence of low or very low quality for our purposes.
<CON> Investigators should consider adjusting for potential confounding related to BMI.
<CON> Trials should be designed to include sufficient numbers of overweight or obese women to adequately examine effectiveness and side effects of hormonal contraceptives within those groups.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Biofeedback for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Chronic constipation (inability to achieve satisfactory bowel emptying for a prolonged period with no apparent medical cause) can be an embarrassing and socially restricting problem.
<ABS> The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and side effects of biofeedback therapy used for the treatment of chronic constipation in adults who are unable to relax the muscles which control bowel movements.
<ABS> This review identified 17 eligible studies that included a total of 931 participants.
<ABS> The studies either compared the effectiveness of different types of biofeedback to one another, or biofeedback to a sham biofeedback (a fake biofeedback treatment) or biofeedback to standard treatment consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives.
<ABS> There is some evidence that biofeedback is superior to treatment with oral diazepam (a sedative known as Valium), sham biofeedback and laxatives.
<ABS> One study of 60 participants found biofeedback with computer equipment to be superior to oral diazepam (a sedative drug that is not usually used to treat constipation).
<ABS> Another study of 77 participants suggests that biofeedback is superior to sham biofeedback or standard therapy consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives.
<ABS> Another study with 109 participants also suggested that biofeedback with computer equipment is superior to conventional treatment with laxatives and dietary and lifestyle advice.
<ABS> Some surgical procedures (partial division of puborectalis and stapled transanal rectal resection) were reported to be superior to biofeedback.
<ABS> However, there was a high risk of side effects in the surgical treatment groups including wound infection, faecal incontinence, pain, and bleeding that required further surgery.
<ABS> One other study of 60 participants did not find a difference in effectiveness between surgery (posterior myomectomy of internal anal sphincter and puborectalis) and biofeedback treatment.
<ABS> Botulinum toxin-A injection may have short term benefits over biofeedback, but the benefit does not last.
<ABS> No adverse events were reported for biofeedback, although this was not specifically reported in the majority of studies.
<ABS> The results of this review need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence from the studies was rated as low or very low due to lack of precision of the results and the low methodological quality of the studies.
<ABS> Thus no firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness and potential side effects of biofeedback treatment for patients with chronic constipation who are unable to relax the muscles which control bowel movements.
<ABS> Further larger trials are needed to provide better evidence.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Hand searching of conference proceedings and the reference lists of relevant articles was also undertaken.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The primary outcome was global or clinical improvement as defined by the included studies.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies.
<MaM> Where possible, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.
<MaM> We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seventeen eligible studies were identified with a total of 931 participants.
<RES> Most participants had chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation.
<RES> Sixteen of the trials were at high risk of bias for blinding.
<RES> Attrition bias (4 trials) and other potential bias (5 trials) was also noted.
<RES> Due to differences between study populations, the heterogeneity of the different samples and large range of different outcome measures, meta-analysis was not possible.
<RES> Different effect sizes were reported ranging from 40 to 100% of patients who received biofeedback improving following the intervention.
<RES> While electromyograph (EMG) biofeedback was the most commonly used, there is a lack of evidence as to whether any one method of biofeedback is more effective than any other method of biofeedback.
<RES> We found low or very low quality evidence that biofeedback is superior to oral diazepam, sham biofeedback and laxatives.
<RES> One study (n = 60) found EMG biofeedback to be superior to oral diazepam.
<RES> Seventy per cent (21/30) of biofeedback patients had improved constipation at three month follow-up compared to 23% (7/30) of diazepam patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.98).
<RES> One study compared manometry biofeedback to sham biofeedback or standard therapy consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives.
<RES> The mean number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 2.8 in the sham biofeedback group (MD 1.80, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.35; 52 patients).
<RES> The mean number of CSBM per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 1.9 in the standard care group (MD 2.70, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.41; 49 patients).
<RES> Another study (n = 109) compared EMG biofeedback to conventional treatment with laxatives and dietary and lifestyle advice.
<RES> This study found that at both 6 and 12 months 80% (43/54) of biofeedback patients reported clinical improvement compared to 22% (12/55) laxative-treated patients (RR 3.65, 95% CI 2.17 to 6.13).
<RES> Some surgical procedures (partial division of puborectalis and stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR)) were reported to be superior to biofeedback, although with a high risk of adverse events in the surgical groups (wound infection, faecal incontinence, pain, and bleeding that required further surgical intervention).
<RES> Successful treatment, defined as a decrease in the obstructed defecation score of > 50% at one year was reported in 33% (3/39) of EMG biofeedback patients compared to 82% (44/54) of STARR patients (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.65).
<RES> For the other study the mean constipation score at one year was 16.1 in the balloon sensory biofeedback group compared to 10.5 in the partial division of puborectalis surgery group (MD 5.60, 95% CI 4.67 to 6.53; 40 patients).
<RES> Another study (n = 60) found no significant difference in efficacy did not demonstrate the superiority of a surgical intervention (posterior myomectomy of internal anal sphincter and puborectalis) over biofeedback.
<RES> No adverse events were reported for biofeedback, although this was not specifically reported in the majority of studies.
<RES> The results of all of these studies need to be interpreted with caution as GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes (i.e. clinical or global improvement as defined by the studies) as low or very low due to high risk of bias (i.e. open label studies, self-selection bias, incomplete outcome data, and baseline imbalance) and imprecision (i.e. sparse data).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation.
<CON> We found low or very low quality evidence from single studies to support the effectiveness of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation.
<CON> However, the majority of trials are of poor methodological quality and subject to bias.
<CON> Further well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes, validated outcome measures (especially patient reported outcome measures) and long-term follow-up are required to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is P. vivax malaria and how do ACTs work?
<ABS> P. vivax is one of five species of the malaria parasite known to cause clinical illness.
<ABS> It is a common cause of malaria in Asia, South America and Oceania.
<ABS> This liver stage can become active and cause a relapse of clinical illness weeks or even years after the initial illness.
<ABS> The standard treatment for vivax malaria has been chloroquine to treat the clinical illness, and a 14-day course of primaquine to clear the liver stage.
<ABS> In some parts of Oceania the P. vivax parasite in now highly resistant to chloroquine, which makes this treatment ineffective.
<ABS> Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria worldwide.
<ABS> As the effectiveness of chloroquine for P. vivax declines, alternative therapies are needed.
<ABS> If ACTs are also effective against P. vivax they could become the standard treatment for all forms of malaria.
<ABS> Current ACT combinations do not contain drugs effective against the liver stage of P. vivax so primaquine would still be necessary to achieve complete cure.
<ABS> What the research says about the effect of using ACTs
<ABS> We examined the research published up to 28 March 2013.
<ABS> Compared to chloroquine
<ABS> People who are treated with an ACT are probably less likely to have another episode of P. vivax malaria during the next six to eight weeks than those treated with chloroquine (only dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, and artesunate-pyronaridine have been compared with chloroquine).
<ABS> It is not clear whether this advantage is still present when primaquine is given to achieve a complete cure.
<ABS> Compared to alternative ACTs
<ABS> People who are treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine are probably less likely to have another episode of P. vivax malaria during the next six weeks than those treated with alternative ACTs (only artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate plus amodiaquine have been compared).
<ABS> This advantage may be present even when additional primaquine is given to achieve a complete cure.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review aims to assess the current treatment options in the light of increasing chloroquine resistance.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> We used recurrent parasitaemia prior to day 28 as a proxy for effective treatment of the blood stage parasite, and compared drug treatments using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> We used trials following patients for longer than 28 days to assess the duration of the post-treatment prophylactic effect of ACTs.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 14 trials, that enrolled 2592 participants, and were all conducted in Asia and Oceania between 2002 and 2011.
<RES> ACTs versus chloroquine
<RES> ACTs clear parasites from the peripheral blood quicker than chloroquine monotherapy (parasitaemia after 24 hours of treatment: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.50, four trials, 1652 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> In settings where chloroquine remains effective, ACTs are as effective as chloroquine at preventing recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.90, five trials, 1622 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> In four of these trials, recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 were very low following treatment with both chloroquine and ACTs.
<RES> The fifth trial, from Thailand in 2011, found increased recurrent parasitaemias following treatment with chloroquine (9%), while they remained low following ACT (2%) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.66, one trial, 437 participants).
<RES> ACT combinations with long half-lives probably also provide a longer prophylactic effect after treatment, with significantly fewer recurrent parasitaemias between day 28 and day 42 or day 63 (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.82, three trials, 1066 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> One trial, from Cambodia, Thailand, India and Indonesia, gave additional primaquine to both treatment groups to reduce the risk of spontaneous relapses.
<RES> Recurrent parasitaemias after day 28 were lower than seen in the trials that did not give primaquine, but the ACT still appeared to have an advantage (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.94, one trial, 376 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> ACTs versus alternative ACTs
<RES> In high transmission settings, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is probably superior to artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate plus amodiaquine at preventing recurrent parasitaemias before day 28 (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49, three trials, 334 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine may also have an improved post-treatment prophylactic effect lasting for up to six weeks, and this effect may be present even when primaquine is also given to achieve radical cure (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.46, two trials, 179 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> The data available from low transmission settings is too limited to reliably assess the relative effectiveness of ACTs.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> ACTs appear at least equivalent to chloroquine at effectively treating the blood stage of P. vivax infection.
<CON> Even in areas where chloroquine remains effective, this finding may allow for simplified protocols for treating all forms of malaria with ACTs.
<CON> In areas where chloroquine no longer cures the infection, ACTs offer an effective alternative.
<CON> Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is the most studied ACT.
<CON> It may provide a longer period of post-treatment prophylaxis than artemether-lumefantrine or artesunate plus amodiaquine.
<CON> This effect may be clinically important in high transmission settings whether primaquine is also given or not.

<H1> Deep brain and cortical stimulation for epilepsy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Intracranial electrical stimulation to treat drug-resistant epilepsy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Despite many antiepileptic drugs being available, about 30% of epilepsy patients are not seizure-free.
<ABS> Electrical stimulation through intracranially implanted electrodes has been proposed as an alternative treatment for these patients.
<ABS> This review aimed to evaluate its efficacy, safety and tolerability.
<ABS> Various brain structures have been targeted with scheduled (that is seizure-independent) stimulation, including the anterior thalamic nucleus (1 trial, 109 participants), the centromedian thalamic nucleus (2 trials, 20 participants), the cerebellar cortex (3 trials, 22 participants) and the hippocampus (3 trials, 15 participants).
<ABS> In addition, one trial (191 participants) studied responsive stimulation (that is only upon seizure detection) of the seizure onset zone.
<ABS> There is evidence for moderate (15% to 30%) seizure frequency reduction after short-term (one to three months) anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation in (multi)focal epilepsy, hippocampal stimulation in temporal lobe epilepsy, and responsive seizure onset zone stimulation in (multi)focal epilepsy.
<ABS> However, there is no evidence for significant impact on seizure freedom, the proportion of patients with a greater than 50% seizure frequency reduction, or quality of life.
<ABS> Adverse effects of anterior thalamic stimulation include self-reported depression and subjective memory impairment, and possibly anxiety and confusional state.
<ABS> Responsive seizure onset zone stimulation was well tolerated with few side effects but the sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) rate was slightly elevated in the (for this purpose) small trial and should be closely monitored in further studies.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusive statements on the efficacy or side effects of hippocampal, centromedian thalamic and cerebellar cortical stimulation.
<ABS> Intracranial implantation of the electrodes was relatively safe without permanent symptomatic sequelae in the patients included in the trials.
<ABS> More larger and well-designed trials on intracranial electrical stimulation treatments are needed to validate and optimize its efficacy and safety and to compare this treatment to currently available treatments (for example antiepileptic drugs).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Despite optimal medical treatment, including epilepsy surgery, many epilepsy patients have uncontrolled seizures.
<INT> In the last decades, interest has grown in invasive intracranial neurostimulation as a treatment for these patients.
<INT> Intracranial stimulation includes both deep brain stimulation (DBS) (stimulation through depth electrodes) and cortical stimulation (subdural electrodes).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched PubMed (6 August 2013), the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (31 August 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7 of 12) and reference lists of retrieved articles.
<MaM> We also contacted device manufacturers and other researchers in the field.
<MaM> No language restrictions were imposed.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Four review authors independently selected trials for inclusion.
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted the relevant data and assessed trial quality and overall quality of evidence.
<MaM> The outcomes investigated were seizure freedom, responder rate, percentage seizure frequency reduction, adverse events, neuropsychological outcome and quality of life.
<MaM> If additional data were needed, the study investigators were contacted.
<MaM> Results were analysed and reported separately for different intracranial targets for reasons of clinical heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten RCTs comparing one to three months of intracranial neurostimulation to sham stimulation were identified.
<RES> One trial was on anterior thalamic DBS (n = 109; 109 treatment periods); two trials on centromedian thalamic DBS (n = 20; 40 treatment periods), but only one of the trials (n = 7; 14 treatment periods) reported sufficient information for inclusion in the quantitative meta-analysis; three trials on cerebellar stimulation (n = 22; 39 treatment periods); three trials on hippocampal DBS (n = 15; 21 treatment periods); and one trial on responsive ictal onset zone stimulation (n = 191; 191 treatment periods).
<RES> Evidence of selective reporting was present in four trials and the possibility of a carryover effect complicating interpretation of the results could not be excluded in 4 cross-over trials without any washout period.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence could not demonstrate statistically or clinically significant changes in the proportion of patients who were seizure-free or experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (primary outcome measures) after 1 to 3 months of anterior thalamic DBS in (multi)focal epilepsy, responsive ictal onset zone stimulation in (multi)focal epilepsy patients and hippocampal DBS in (medial) temporal lobe epilepsy.
<RES> However, a statistically significant reduction in seizure frequency was found for anterior thalamic DBS (-17.4% compared to sham stimulation; 95% confidence interval (CI) -32.1 to -1.0; high-quality evidence), responsive ictal onset zone stimulation (-24.9%; 95% CI -40.1 to 6.0; high-quality evidence) ) and hippocampal DBS (-28.1%; 95% CI -34.1 to -22.2; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Both anterior thalamic DBS and responsive ictal onset zone stimulation do not have a clinically meaningful impact on quality life after three months of stimulation (high-quality evidence).
<RES> Electrode implantation resulted in asymptomatic intracranial haemorrhage in 3% to 4% of the patients included in the two largest trials and 5% to 13% had soft tissue infections; no patient reported permanent symptomatic sequelae.
<RES> Anterior thalamic DBS was associated with fewer epilepsy-associated injuries (7.4 versus 25.5%; P = 0.01) but higher rates of self-reported depression (14.8 versus 1.8%; P = 0.02) and subjective memory impairment (13.8 versus 1.8%; P = 0.03); there were no significant differences in formal neuropsychological testing results between the groups.
<RES> Responsive ictal-onset zone stimulation was well tolerated with few side effects but SUDEP rate should be closely monitored in the future (4 per 340 [= 11.8 per 1000] patient-years; literature: 2.2-10 per 1000 patient-years).
<RES> The limited number of patients preclude firm statements on safety and tolerability of hippocampal DBS.
<RES> With regards to centromedian thalamic DBS and cerebellar stimulation, no statistically significant effects could be demonstrated but evidence is of only low to very low quality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Only short term RCTs on intracranial neurostimulation for epilepsy are available.
<CON> Compared to sham stimulation, one to three months of anterior thalamic DBS ((multi)focal epilepsy), responsive ictal onset zone stimulation ((multi)focal epilepsy) and hippocampal DBS (temporal lobe epilepsy) moderately reduce seizure frequency in refractory epilepsy patients.
<CON> Anterior thalamic DBS is associated with higher rates of self-reported depression and subjective memory impairment.
<CON> There is a need for more, large and well-designed RCTs to validate and optimize the efficacy and safety of invasive intracranial neurostimulation treatments.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> After an injury at a high point on the spinal cord (a cervical injury), the muscles responsible for breathing are paralysed or weakened.
<ABS> This weakness reduces the volume of the lungs (lung capacity), the ability to take a deep breath and cough, and puts them at greater risk of lung infection.
<ABS> Just like other muscles of the body, it is possible to train the breathing (respiratory) muscles to be stronger; however, it is not clear if such training is effective for people with a cervical spinal cord injury.
<ABS> This review compared any type of respiratory muscle training with standard care or sham treatments.
<ABS> No effect was seen on the maximum amount of air that can be pushed out in one breath, or shortness of breath.
<ABS> An insufficient number of studies had examined the effect of respiratory muscle training on the frequency of lung infections or quality of life, so we could not assess these outcomes in the review.
<ABS> We identified no adverse effects of training the breathing muscles for people with a cervical spinal cord injury.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and literature reviews.
<MaM> We applied no date, language, or publication restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected articles for inclusion, evaluated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data.
<MaM> We sought additional information from the trial authors when necessary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 11 studies with 212 participants with cervical SCI.
<RES> The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of RMT for three outcomes: vital capacity (MD mean end point 0.4 L, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69), maximal inspiratory pressure (MD mean end point 10.50 cm/H2O, 95% CI 3.42 to 17.57), and maximal expiratory pressure (MD mean end point 10.31 cm/H2O, 95% CI 2.80 to 17.82).
<RES> There was no effect on forced expiratory volume in one second or dyspnoea.
<RES> We could not combine the results from quality of life assessment tools from three studies for meta-analysis.
<RES> Respiratory complication outcomes were infrequently reported and thus we could not include them in the meta-analysis.
<RES> Instead, we described the results narratively.
<RES> We identified no adverse effects as a result of RMT in cervical SCI.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In spite of the relatively small number of studies included in this review, meta-analysis of the pooled data indicates that RMT is effective for increasing respiratory muscle strength and perhaps also lung volumes for people with cervical SCI.
<CON> Further research is needed on functional outcomes following RMT, such as dyspnoea, cough efficacy, respiratory complications, hospital admissions, and quality of life.
<CON> In addition, longer-term studies are needed to ascertain optimal dosage and determine any carryover effects of RMT on respiratory function, quality of life, respiratory morbidity, and mortality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Urinary stone disease is frequently seen in the urology practice.
<ABS> Symptoms include flank or abdominal pain radiating to the groin or external genitalia.
<ABS> Although some patients with ureteral stones might remain asymptomatic, many have pain and thus commonly seek medical care.
<ABS> An acute episode of colic is the result of a stone entering the ureter and causing intermittent rise of pressure in the pyelocalyceal system.
<ABS> Spontaneous passage will occur in most of these stones.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to determine if medical treatment with alpha-blockers compared to other pharmacotherapy or placebo improves stone clearance rates in adult patients presenting with symptoms of ureteral stones less than 10 mm.
<ABS> This review identified 32 studies enrolling 5864 participants.
<ABS> The use of alpha-blockers in patients with ureteral stones resulted in a higher stone-free rate and a shorter time to expulsion and therefore decreased the duration of symptoms and rate of complications (UTI, hydronephrosis and impairment of kidney function).
<ABS> Patients using alpha-blockers were more likely to experience adverse effects (dizziness, palpitations, headache, rhinitis, retrograde ejaculation, fatigue and asthenia, cutaneous reaction and postural hypotension) when compared to standard therapy or placebo.
<ABS> Most adverse effects were mild of origin and did not lead to cessation of therapy, and several studies reported no adverse events in either the treatment or control group.
<ABS> Alpha-blockers could be considered as first-line treatment for patients presenting with urinary stones.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Urinary stone disease is one of the most common reasons for patients visiting a urology practice, affecting about 5% to 10% of the population.
<INT> Annual costs for stone disease have rapidly increased over the years and most patients with ureteral colic or other symptoms seek medical care.
<INT> Stone size and location are important predictors of stone passage.
<INT> In most cases medical expulsive therapy is an appropriate treatment modality and most studies have been performed with alpha-blockers.
<INT> Alpha-blockers tend to decrease intra-ureteral pressure and increase fluid passage which might increase stone passage.
<INT> Faster stone expulsion will decrease the rate of complications, the need for invasive interventions and eventually decrease healthcare costs.
<INT> A study on the effect of alpha-blockers as medical expulsive therapy in ureteral stones is therefore warranted.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Other clinically relevant outcomes such as stone expulsion time, hospitalisation, pain scores, analgesic use and adverse effects have also been explored.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.
<MaM> Reporting bias was investigated using funnel plots.
<MaM> Subgroup analysis was used to explore possible sources of heterogeneity.
<MaM> Sensitivity analysis was performed removing studies of poor methodological quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-two studies (5864 participants) were included.
<RES> The stone-free rates were significantly higher in the alpha-blocker group (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.64) when compared to standard therapy.
<RES> Stone expulsion time was 2.91 days shorter with the use of alpha-blockers (MD -2.91, 95% CI -4.00 to -1.81).
<RES> Use of alpha-blockers reduced the number of pain episodes (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.01), the need for analgesic medication (diclofenac) (MD -38.17 mg, 95% CI -74.93 to -1.41) and hospitalisation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.97).
<RES> Patients using alpha-blockers were more likely to experience adverse effects when compared to standard therapy (RR 2.74, 95% CI 1.38 to 5.45) or placebo (RR 2.73, 95% CI 1.50 to 4.96).
<RES> Most adverse effects were mild of origin and did not lead to cessation of therapy, and several studies reported no adverse events in either the treatment or control group.
<RES> In 7/32 studies patients and doctors were both blinded.
<RES> In the other studies blinding was not described in the methods or no blinding had taken place.
<RES> Two studies described incomplete data and only one study showed a relatively high number of patients who withdrew from the study.
<RES> These factors limited the methodological strength of the evidence found.

<H1> Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Approximately one in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime, and the number of men living with, or after, the diagnosis will continue to rise.
<ABS> Some of them will experience problems such as difficulty in passing urine, pain and sexual dysfunction, and these may cause distress, anxiety, uncertainty or depression.
<ABS> Their quality of life may therefore be affected.
<ABS> Health professionals often provide interventions to address some of these prostate cancer–related symptoms and the psychosocial problems that they may cause.
<ABS> However as yet, we do not know how effective, collectively, these interventions are.
<ABS> In this review, we assessed studies that compared the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions versus the usual care that participants received.
<ABS> The evidence is current to October 2013.
<ABS> Nineteen studies, with a total of 3204 men at different stages of prostate cancer, were included.
<ABS> All but three of these studies were carried out in the United States.
<ABS> The review focused on the following outcomes: quality of life, self-efficacy, knowledge, uncertainty, distress and depression.
<ABS> The results show that psychosocial interventions resulted in small improvements in quality of life at end of intervention; however, it is not clear whether these small improvements actually made a difference to participants.
<ABS> The interventions were also effective in increasing knowledge up to three months after the intervention.
<ABS> No evidence suggests that these interventions improved self-efficacy or reduced uncertainty, distress and depression in men with prostate cancer.
<ABS> No clear evidence shows that group-based interventions were, on the whole, more effective than individual-based ones for most of the outcomes measured in this review.
<ABS> All of these findings should be treated with caution, as the quality of the evidence was largely rated as very low.
<ABS> Some of these studies were small, and the number of participants who dropped out of some studies was high.
<ABS> The men were at various stages of prostate cancer.
<ABS> Interventions also varied in terms of content, delivery and how long they lasted.
<ABS> More and better research is needed to determine which types of psychosocial interventions are effective for meeting the needs of men at different stages of prostate cancer.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions for men at any stage of prostate cancer.
<MaM> We included psychosocial interventions that explicitly used one or a combination of the following approaches: cognitive behavioural, psychoeducational, supportive and counselling.
<MaM> Interventions had to be delivered or facilitated by trained or lay personnel.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Pairs of review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> We analysed data using standardised mean differences (SMDs), random-effects models and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen studies comparing psychosocial interventions versus usual care in a total of 3204 men with prostate cancer were included in this review.
<RES> All but three of these studies were conducted in the United States.
<RES> Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a small, statistically significant improvement in the physical component of general health–related quality of life (GHQoL) at end of intervention (1414 participants, SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.22) based on low-quality evidence.
<RES> A small improvement in favour of psychosocial interventions (SMD 0.24, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.47) was also seen in the physical component of GHQoL at end of intervention for group-based interventions.
<RES> No clear evidence of benefit was found for GHQoL scores at end of intervention with individual-based interventions compared with controls.
<RES> Also, no clear evidence suggested that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in improving the physical component of GHQoL at four to six and at eight to 12 months post-intervention.
<RES> In addition, no clear evidence showed benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for the mental component of GHQoL at end of intervention (1416 participants, SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.06) based on moderate-quality evidence.
<RES> Results for the mental component of GHQoL at four to six and at eight to 12 months post-intervention were compatible with benefit and harm.
<RES> At end of intervention, cancer-related QoL showed a small improvement following psychosocial interventions (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.39), but at eight and 12 months, the effect was compatible with benefit and harm.
<RES> For prostate cancer–specific and symptom-related QoL, the differences between groups were not significant.
<RES> No clear evidence indicated that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in improving self-efficacy at end of intervention (337 participants, SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38) based on very low-quality evidence in three studies that assessed individual-based interventions.
<RES> The results for self-efficacy at six to eight and at 12 months post-intervention were compatible with benefit and harm.
<RES> Men in the psychosocial intervention group had a moderate increase in prostate cancer knowledge at end of intervention (506 participants, SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.71) based on very low-quality evidence in two studies; this increase was also observed in the subgroups of group-based and individual-based interventions.
<RES> A small increase in knowledge with psychosocial interventions was noted at three months post-intervention (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.58).
<RES> The results for uncertainty (916 participants, SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.26) and distress (916 participants, SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.15) at end of intervention were compatible with both benefit and harm based on very low-quality evidence.
<RES> No clear evidence suggests that psychosocial interventions were beneficial in reducing uncertainty and distress between groups at six to eight and at 12 months post-intervention.
<RES> Finally, no clear evidence of benefit is associated with psychosocial interventions for depression at end of intervention (434 participants, SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.15) based on very low-quality evidence.
<RES> Individual-based interventions significantly reduced depression when compared with usual care groups.
<RES> The results for depression at six and at 12 months post-intervention were compatible with benefit and harm.
<RES> The overall risk of bias in the included studies was unclear or high, primarily as the result of performance bias.
<RES> No data regarding stage of disease or treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were extractable for subgroup analysis.
<RES> Only one study addressed adverse effects.
<RES> High attrition could indicate that some participants may not have been comfortable with the interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Overall, this review shows that psychosocial interventions may have small, short-term beneficial effects on certain domains of well-being, as measured by the physical component of GHQoL and cancer-related QoL when compared with usual care.
<CON> Prostate cancer knowledge was also increased.
<CON> However, this review failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on other domains such as symptom-related QoL, self-efficacy, uncertainty, distress or depression.
<CON> Moreover, when beneficial effects were observed, it remained uncertain whether the magnitude of effect was large enough to be considered clinically important.
<CON> The quality of evidence for most outcomes was rated as very low according to GRADE, reflecting study limitations, loss to follow-up, study heterogeneity and small sample sizes.
<CON> We were unable to perform meaningful subgroup analyses based on disease stage or treatment modality.
<CON> Although some findings of this review are encouraging, they do not provide sufficiently strong evidence to permit meaningful conclusions about the effects of these interventions in men with prostate cancer.
<CON> Additional well-done and transparently reported research studies are necessary to establish the role of psychosocial interventions in men with prostate cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms.
<ABS> For many people, the main feature is a painful headache.
<ABS> Other symptoms include disturbed vision; sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; feeling sick; and vomiting.
<ABS> Both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the triptan class of drugs are used to treat migraine headaches.
<ABS> This review examined how well naproxen (an NSAID) and sumatriptan (a triptan) work when combined together.
<ABS> On 2 August 2013, we looked for clinical trials where sumatriptan plus naproxen was used to treat migraine headache.
<ABS> We found 12 good quality studies with about 9300 people.
<ABS> The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was more effective than placebo for relieving acute migraine headache in adults.
<ABS> The combination was also better than the same dose of either drug given alone.
<ABS> When the starting headache intensity was mild, 5 in 10 (50%) of those people treated with the combination were pain-free at two hours compared with about 2 in 10 (18%) with placebo.
<ABS> Almost 6 in 10 (58%) of those people with moderate or severe pain who were treated with the combination had pain reduced to mild or none at two hours, compared with 3 in 10 (27%) with placebo.
<ABS> Results were 5 in 10 (52%) people with sumatriptan alone or about 4 in 10 (44%) with naproxen alone.
<ABS> Headaches were more successfully treated when medication was taken early in an attack when pain was mild.
<ABS> The combination was better than placebo or either drug alone for relief of other migraine symptoms (nausea, sensitivity to light or sound) and loss of ability to function normally.
<ABS> Adverse events of dizziness, tingling or burning of the skin, sleepiness (somnolence), nausea, indigestion (dyspepsia), dry mouth, and chest discomfort were more common with sumatriptan (alone or in combination) than with placebo or naproxen.
<ABS> They were generally of mild to moderate severity and rarely led to withdrawal from the studies.
<ABS> The combination of sumatriptan plus naproxen was useful for treating migraine in the studies we found.
<ABS> It was not a lot better than using sumatriptan alone, but it was much better than using naproxen alone.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Migraine is a common disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society.
<INT> Sumatriptan plus naproxen is now available in combination form for the acute treatment of migraine.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched the reference list of included studies and relevant reviews.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 studies using sumatriptan 85 mg or 50 mg plus naproxen 500 mg to treat attacks of mild, moderate, or severe pain intensity: 3663 participants received combination treatment, 3682 placebo, 964 sumatriptan, and 982 naproxen.
<RES> No studies were considered to be at high risk of bias for any of the criteria evaluated.
<RES> Overall, the combination was better than placebo for pain-free and headache relief responses.
<RES> At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 3.1 when the baseline pain was mild (50% response with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 18% with placebo), and 4.9 when baseline pain was moderate or severe (28% with sumatriptan plus naproxen compared with 8% with placebo) (RR 3.65 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.5); high quality evidence).
<RES> Using 50 mg of sumatriptan, rather than 85 mg, in the combination did not significantly change the result.
<RES> Treating early, when pain was still mild, was significantly better than treating once pain was moderate or severe for pain-free responses at two hours and during the 24 hours post dose.
<RES> Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal; they were more common with the combination than with placebo.
<RES> Where the data allowed direct comparison, combination treatment was superior to either monotherapy, but adverse events were less frequent with naproxen than sumatriptan.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Combination treatment was effective in the acute treatment of migraine headaches.
<CON> The effect was greater than for the same dose of either sumatriptan or naproxen alone, but additional benefits over sumatriptan alone are not large.
<CON> More participants achieved good relief when medication was taken early in the attack, when pain was still mild.
<CON> Adverse events were more common with the combination and sumatriptan alone than with placebo or naproxen alone.

<ABS> This review looked at evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of anticonvulsants alone or in combination with another medication or a psychosocial intervention for the treatment of alcohol dependence.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications.
<ABS> Together with psychosocial interventions, different pharmacological interventions have been tested in trials and systematic reviews.
<ABS> In this review, we wanted to discover whether anticonvulsants are better than placebo or are better than other medications, psychosocial interventions or no intervention.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> In October 2013, we used electronic medical databases to find all published and unpublished medical trials that compared anticonvulsants with placebo or other interventions.
<ABS> We also used other sources, such as conference proceedings, likely to contain trials relevant to the review.
<ABS> To be included in the review, medical trials had to have a randomised design and had to include adult participants (older than 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.
<ABS> We identified 25 medical trials involving a total of 2641 participants.
<ABS> 80% of participants in these trials were male; mean age was 44 years.
<ABS> Most studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo (17 studies), but some researchers compared anticonvulsants versus other medications (seven studies) or no medication (two studies).
<ABS> The mean duration of the trials was 17 weeks (range four to 52 weeks).
<ABS> Half of the trials took place in the USA, the other half in Spain, Brasil, Germany, Greece, Italy, India and Thailand.
<ABS> The anticonvulsant included in most of the trials was topiramate; other medications were gabapentin, valproate, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide, carbamazepine, pregabalin and tiagabine.
<ABS> Included studies used 73 different rating instruments and differed in design, quality, characteristics of patients, tested medications, services provided and treatments delivered.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> In 17 studies versus placebo, anticonvulsants were shown to be more effective than placebo in terms of number of drinks per drinking day and average heavy drinking.
<ABS> However, we found no clear evidence that anticonvulsants led to more participants abstaining from alcohol, fewer participants drinking heavily or fewer participants leaving treatment (dropouts).
<ABS> In terms of safety issues, the rate of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects was not lower or higher in participants treated with anticonvulsants than in those treated with placebo.
<ABS> Moreover, for two of 18 specific side effects (dizziness and paraesthesia), anticonvulsants were worse than placebo.
<ABS> Other major known side effects, such as those affecting cognitive functioning (attention, confusion, speech problems), were insufficiently explored by primary studies.
<ABS> For single medications, results were globally confirmed for topiramate and partially for gabapentin and valproate.
<ABS> In the five studies in which anticonvulsants were compared with naltrexone, a medication considered efficacious for the treatment of alcohol dependence, anticonvulsants were associated with a lower number of heavy drinking days, with a higher number of days before a severe relapse occurred and with a lower rate of patient withdrawal for medical reasons.
<ABS> However, anticonvulsants were not more or less effective than naltrexone in affecting the rate of participants who showed severe relapse, who were not drinking during the trial or who left treatment (dropouts).
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> In looking at primary outcomes (dropouts, abstinence from alcohol during the trial, number of drinks per drinking day, heavy drinking, rate of patient withdrawal for medical reasons), the quality of the included studies was considered moderate.
<ABS> However, moving to subgroup analysis, as in the case of single types of medications, as well as to comparisons versus other medications, the finding of the review is limited by the small number of available studies.
<ABS> Authors' conclusions
<ABS> At the current stage of research, evidence supporting the clinical use of anticonvulsants to treat alcohol dependence is insufficient.
<ABS> Results are conditioned by heterogeneity and by the low number and quality of studies comparing anticonvulsants versus other medications.
<ABS> The uncertainty associated with these results leaves to clinicians the need to balance the possible benefits/risks of treatment with anticonvulsants versus other medications as supported by evidence of efficacy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Alcohol dependence is a major public health problem that is characterised by recidivism and a host of medical and psychosocial complications.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary aim of the review is to assess the benefits/risks of anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 25 studies were included in the review (2641 participants).
<RES> Most participants were male, with an average age of 44 years.
<RES> Anticonvulsants were compared with placebo (17 studies), other medications (seven studies) and no medication (two studies).
<RES> The mean duration of the trials was 17 weeks (range four to 52 weeks).
<RES> The studies took place in the USA, Europe, South America, India and Thailand.
<RES> Variation was reported in the characteristics of the studies, including their design and the rating instruments used.
<RES> For many key outcomes, the risk of bias associated with unclear or unconcealed allocation and lack of blinding affected the quality of the evidence.
<RES> Anticonvulsants versus placebo: For dropouts (16 studies, 1675 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.74 to 1.19, moderate-quality evidence) and continuous abstinence (eight studies, 634 participants, RR 1.21, 95% Cl 95% 0.97 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence), results showed no evidence of differences.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence suggested that anticonvulsants reduced drinks/drinking days (11 studies, 1126 participants, mean difference (MD) -1.49, 95% Cl -2.32 to -0.65) and heavy drinking (12 studies, 1129 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35, 95% Cl -0.51 to -0.19).
<RES> Moreover, withdrawal for medical reasons (12 studies, 1410 participants, RR 1.22, 95% Cl 0.58 to 2.56, moderate-quality evidence) showed no evidence of difference, but for specific adverse effects (nine studies, 1164 participants), two of 18 adverse event outcomes favoured placebo.
<RES> The direction of results was confirmed by subgroup analyses for topiramate and partially for gabapentin and valproate.
<RES> Anticonvulsants versus naltrexone: No evidence of difference was shown in dropout rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06), severe relapse rates (four studies, 427 participants, RR 0.69, 95% Cl 0.44 to 1.07) and continuous abstinence rates (five studies, 528 participants, RR 1.21, 95% Cl 0.99 to 1.49); anticonvulsants were associated with fewer heavy drinking days (three studies, 308 participants, MD -5.21, 95% Cl -8.58 to -1.83), more days to severe relapse (three studies, 244 participants, MD 11.88, 95% Cl 3.29 to 20.46) and lower withdrawal for medical reasons (three studies, 245 participants, RR 0.13, 95% Cl 0.03 to 0.58).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> At the current stage of research, randomised evidence supporting the clinical use of anticonvulsants to treat alcohol dependence is insufficient.
<CON> Results are conditioned by heterogeneity and by the low number and quality of studies comparing anticonvulsants with other medications.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for rhabdomyolysis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening condition where damaged muscle tissue breaks down quickly, and products of damaged muscle cells are released into the bloodstream.
<ABS> Of these products, a protein called myoglobin is harmful to kidney health and can lead to acute kidney injury.
<ABS> There is some evidence to suggest that continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may provide benefits for people with rhabdomyolysis.
<ABS> We searched the literature published before 6 January 2014, and after assessment, included three small studies that involved 101 participants.
<ABS> Our analysis found that although CRRT showed limited advantages over conventional treatment to improve some aspects of kidney function and muscle tissue loss, we found no significant benefits in reducing risk of death.
<ABS> The small body of available evidence demonstrated poor methodological quality, and was insufficient to enable us to make any robust conclusions about the effectiveness of CRRT for people with rhabdomyolysis.
<ABS> Larger and better designed studies would be needed to investigate if CRRT is beneficial for people with rhabdomyolysis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that is characterised by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue and leakage of intracellular myocyte contents into circulating blood.
<INT> Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and is a potentially life-threatening condition.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure (from 1 January 1979 to 16 April 2013) and the Chinese Clinical Trials Register (to 16 April 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.
<MaM> We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Methodological risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the three included studies (101 participants), one evaluated continuous arteriovenous haemodialysis and two investigated continuous venovenous haemofiltration; all included conventional therapy as control.
<RES> Although CRRT was associated with improved serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and potassium levels; reduced duration of the oliguria phase; and was associated with reduced time in hospital, no significant differences were found in mortality rates compared with conventional therapy (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.37).
<RES> The included studies did not report on long-term outcomes or prevention of AKI.
<RES> Overall, we found that study quality was suboptimal: blinding and randomisation allocation were not reported by any of the included studies, leading to the possibility of selection, performance and detection bias.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with serious mental illness tend to have poorer physical health than the general population with a greater risk of contracting diseases and often die at an early age.
<ABS> In schizophrenia, for example, life expectancy is reduced by about 10 years.
<ABS> People with mental health problems have higher rates of heart problems (cardiovascular disease), infectious diseases (including HIV and AIDS), diabetes, breathing and respiratory disease, and cancer.
<ABS> Advice can often motivate people to seek further support and treatment.
<ABS> Health advice could improve the quality and duration of life of people with serious mental illness.
<ABS> There is currently much focus on general physical health advice for people with serious mental illness with increasing pressure for health services to take responsibility for providing better advice and information.
<ABS> This review focuses specifically on studies of general physical health advice and excludes more targeted health interventions.
<ABS> Based on an electronic search carried out in 2012, this review now includes seven studies that randomised a total of 1113 people with serious mental illness.
<ABS> Six studies compared general physical health advice with standard care, one compared advice on healthy living with artistic techniques such as sketching and pottery.
<ABS> Information was of limited low or very low quality, there were a small number of participants and findings were ambiguous.
<ABS> There is some limited evidence that the provision of physical healthcare advice can improve health-related quality of life mentally but not physically.
<ABS> No studies returned results that suggest that physical healthcare advice has a powerful effect on physical healthcare behaviour or risk of ill health.
<ABS> More work is needed in this area.
<ABS> Only one adverse effect outcome was presented, death, but there were no differences between the treatment groups for this outcome.
<ABS> Funders and policy makers should be aware that there may be some benefit for physical health advice for people with serious mental illness.
<ABS> There is an increased demand for preventative health services that involve the provision of advice and which may also reduce costs to health services.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray from RETHINK.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (last update search October 2012) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials.
<MaM> There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted data independently.
<MaM> For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis.
<MaM> For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI.
<MaM> We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies are now included in this review.
<RES> For the comparison of physical healthcare advice versus standard care we identified six studies (total n = 964) of limited quality.
<RES> For measures of quality of life one trial found no difference (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD Lehman scale 0.20, CI -0.47 to 0.87, very low quality of evidence) but another two did for the Quality of Life Medical Outcomes Scale - mental component (n = 487, 2 RCTs, MD 3.70, CI 1.76 to 5.64).
<RES> There was no difference between groups for the outcome of death (n = 487, 2 RCTs, RR 0.98, CI 0.27 to 3.56, low quality of evidence).
<RES> For service use two studies presented favourable results for health advice, uptake of ill-health prevention services was significantly greater in the advice group (n = 363, 1 RCT, MD 36.90, CI 33.07 to 40.73) and service use: one or more primary care visit was significantly higher in the advice group (n = 80, 1 RCT, RR 1.77, CI 1.09 to 2.85).
<RES> Economic data were equivocal.
<RES> Attrition was large (> 30%) but similar for both groups (n = 964, 6 RCTs, RR 1.11, CI 0.92 to 1.35).
<RES> Comparisons of one type of physical healthcare advice with another were grossly underpowered and equivocal.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> On the other hand, it is possible clinicians are expending much effort, time and financial resources on giving ineffective advice.
<CON> The main results in this review are based on low or very low quality data.
<CON> There is some limited and poor quality evidence that the provision of general physical healthcare advice can improve health-related quality of life in the mental component but not the physical component, but this evidence is based on data from one study only.
<CON> This is an important area for good research reporting outcome of interest to carers and people with serious illnesses as well as researchers and fundholders.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Lower pole kidney stones are challenging to treat effectively.
<ABS> Many people with lower pole kidney stones undergo shock wave lithotripsy to break up stones so they can be passed from the body in the urine.
<ABS> In some cases, stone fragments can be retained, and these can be difficult to eliminate.
<ABS> Better techniques are needed to help people pass small lower pole kidney stones or fragments that remain following shock wave lithotripsy.
<ABS> We found two small studies that investigated effectiveness and safety of percussion (striking or tapping the body, usually using a device called a percussor), diuresis (therapy to increase urine flow), and inversion therapy (placing the patient at an inverted angle) for treating lower pole kidney stones.
<ABS> Although the evidence we found suggested that percussion, diuresis, and inversion therapy may help the passage of lower pole kidney stones after shock wave lithotripsy, this finding was based on very limited evidence of moderate quality.
<ABS> Further studies investigating these treatments in more people are needed to confirm any observed benefits or harms.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Lower pole kidney stones typically have poor rates of spontaneous clearance from the body.
<INT> Some studies have suggested that diuresis, percussion and inversion therapy could be beneficial for people with lower pole kidney stones following shock wave lithotripsy.
<INT> There is however controversy about the relative benefits, harms, and efficacy of these interventions for the management of lower pole kidney stones.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The first phases of randomised cross-over studies were also eligible for inclusion.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two small studies (177 participants) for inclusion and analysis.
<RES> One study (69 participants) compared percussion, diuresis and inversion therapy following shock wave lithotripsy versus observation-only after shock wave lithotripsy.
<RES> This study reported significantly higher stone-free rates in the intervention group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.82) and a significant reduction in stone burden (MD -3.30, 95% CI -3.58 to -3.03) compared to the observation-only group.
<RES> They reported no significant differences in complication rates (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 76.24).
<RES> The second study (108 participants) compared percussion, diuresis, and inversion therapy plus shock wave lithotripsy with shock wave lithotripsy therapy alone.
<RES> This study reported significantly higher stone-free rates in the intervention group (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.80) and a significant reduction in stone burden (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.56) compared to the control group.
<RES> They reported no significant differences in complication rates (RR 2.54, 95% CI 0.10 to 63.72).
<RES> For both studies selection bias was unclear; there was high risk of bias for performance bias; and detection, attrition and reporting bias were low.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Methodological quality in both studies was assessed as moderate.
<CON> Further well-designed and adequately powered studies are required to inform clinical practice.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Broken bones (fractures) are a major cause of disability in adults.
<ABS> The time taken for a bone to heal (achieve "union") is an important factor in determining recovery after an injury.
<ABS> A minority of fractures fail to heal at all or their healing takes considerably longer than expected.
<ABS> This review set out to find out whether treatment with ultrasound, in a variety of forms, accelerates fracture healing and reduces complications associated with new (acute) fractures.
<ABS> A related intervention, shockwave therapy, was also examined.
<ABS> Typically, ultrasound treatment involves placing a special device in contact with the skin overlying the fracture site for around 20 minutes on a daily basis.
<ABS> This is an update of a review previously published in February 2012.
<ABS> We did a new literature search up till 2 June 2014 but did not find any new studies.
<ABS> There are 12 studies, involving 622 participants with 648 fractures, included in this review.
<ABS> In all the studies we included, participants were assigned randomly to one of two groups, one group receiving treatment by ultrasound and the other group receiving no treatment or sham treatment.
<ABS> Most participants had a recent complete fracture of a single bone.
<ABS> The participants of two trials had 110 incomplete or stress fractures that resulted from heavy exercise.
<ABS> Four trials tested the effects of ultrasound on healing of 203 upper limb fractures and the other trials, on 130 lower limb fractures.
<ABS> The most commonly investigated bone was the tibia (shin bone).
<ABS> Eleven trials tested low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and one trial with 59 fractures tested shockwave therapy.
<ABS> Most trials compared a working ultrasound device with a sham device and thus protected against placebo effects.
<ABS> The placebo effect is a phenomenon whereby patients experience a treatment effect that is not objectively attributable to the treatment itself.
<ABS> However, studies varied substantially in terms of quality and risk of having biased results.
<ABS> In many cases the quality of reporting was poor, which made it difficult to determine which biases might have affected each study.
<ABS> The risk of bias across many domains therefore had to be judged as 'unclear'.
<ABS> The results of many trials were probably biased because of missing data from several trial participants.
<ABS> Additionally, the trials were very different from each other; for example, they varied in the bone that was broken and whether or not the fractures were also treated surgically.
<ABS> Based on analyses that adjusted for these missing data, the available evidence did not confirm that ultrasound improved the time taken for bone healing or prevented the problem of the bone failing to heal at all (eight trials with 333 fractures).
<ABS> The results from one low quality trial (with 59 fractures) testing shockwave therapy were inconclusive.
<ABS> Few complications were reported in any of the studies and these were not related to the ultrasound or shockwave therapy.
<ABS> While a potential benefit of ultrasound for the treatment of acute fractures in adults cannot be ruled out, the currently available evidence from 12 quite different trials is insufficient to support the routine use of ultrasound in clinical practice.
<ABS> Future studies should measure return to full function and normal activity and should try to ensure all participants are followed up.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The morbidity and socioeconomic costs of fractures are considerable.
<INT> The length of time to healing is an important factor in determining a person's recovery after a fracture.
<INT> Ultrasound may have a therapeutic role in reducing the time to union after fracture.
<INT> This is an update of a review previously published in February 2012.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating ultrasound treatment in the management of acute fractures in adults.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 studies, involving 622 participants with 648 fractures.
<RES> Eight studies were randomised placebo-controlled trials, two were randomised controlled trials without placebo controls, one was a quasi-randomised placebo-controlled trial and one was a quasi-randomised controlled trial without placebo control.
<RES> Eleven trials tested LIPUS and one trial tested ECSW.
<RES> Four trials included participants with conservatively treated upper limb complete fractures and six trials included participants with lower limb complete fractures; these were surgically fixed in four trials.
<RES> The remaining two trials reported results for conservatively treated tibial stress fractures.
<RES> 'Risk of bias' assessment of the included studies was hampered by the poor reporting of methods, frequently resulting in the risk of bias of individual domains being judged as ‘unclear’.
<RES> Both quasi-randomised studies were at high risk of bias, including selection and attrition bias.
<RES> Three studies were at low risk of selection bias relating to allocation concealment the majority of studies were at low risk of performance bias as they employed a form of intervention blinding.
<RES> Only limited data were available from three of only four studies reporting on functional outcome.
<RES> One study of complete fractures found little evidence of a difference between the two groups in the time to return to work (mean difference (MD) 1.95 days favouring control, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.18 to 6.08; 101 participants).
<RES> Pooled data from two studies found LIPUS did not significantly affect the time to return to training or duty in soldiers or midshipmen with stress fractures (MD -8.55 days, 95% CI -22.71 to 5.61; 93 participants).
<RES> We adopted a conservative strategy for data analysis that was more likely to underestimate than to overestimate a benefit of the intervention.
<RES> After pooling results from eight studies (446 fractures), the data showed no statistically significant reduction in time to union of complete fractures treated with LIPUS (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.47, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.20).
<RES> This result could include a clinically important benefit or harm, and should be seen in the context of the highly significant statistical heterogeneity (I² = 90%).
<RES> This heterogeneity was not explained by the a priori subgroup analyses (upper limb versus lower limb fracture, smoking status).
<RES> An additional subgroup analysis comparing conservatively and operatively treated fractures raised the possibility that LIPUS may be effective in reducing healing time in conservatively managed fractures, but the test for subgroup differences did not confirm a significant difference between the subgroups.
<RES> Pooled results from five of the eight trials (333 fractures) reporting proportion of delayed union or non-union showed no significant difference between LIPUS and control (10/168 versus 13/165; RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.28).
<RES> Adverse effects directly associated with LIPUS and associated devices were found to be few and minor, and compliance with treatment was generally good.
<RES> One study reporting on pain scores found no difference between groups at eight weeks (101 participants).
<RES> One quasi-randomised study found no significant difference in non-union at 12 months between internal fixation supplemented with ECSW and internal fixation alone (3/27 versus 6/30; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.01).
<RES> There was a clinically small but statistically significant difference in the visual analogue scores for pain in favour of ECSW at three month follow-up (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.37).
<RES> The only reported complication was infection, with no significant difference between the two groups.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Future trials should record functional outcomes and follow-up all trial participants.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in patients with no or very little alcohol consumption is characterised by hepatic histological changes similar to those associated with alcohol-induced liver injury.
<ABS> A range of histological changes can be seen.
<ABS> Some patients have fat accumulation in hepatocytes without significant inflammation or fibrosis (simple hepatic steatosis or NAFLD), but others have hepatic steatosis with prominent necro-inflammatory changes with or without associated fibrosis (this is NASH).
<ABS> Although NAFLD and NASH are common conditions, no effective medical treatment is available to correct the abnormal liver enzymes and adverse outcomes associated with them.
<ABS> This systematic review identified two randomised clinical trials with very small numbers of participants.
<ABS> The small pilot trial (n = 16 patients) assessing simvastatin versus placebo in NASH patients did not show significant effects on liver enzyme activities or liver histology.
<ABS> No adverse events were reported.
<ABS> The other trial compared atorvastatin versus fenofibrate versus a group receiving both interventions in 186 patients with NAFLD.
<ABS> There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the 54 week mean activities of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, or alkaline phosphatases (liver enzymes) in the blood.
<ABS> The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group.
<ABS> Liver histology was not assessed in this trial.
<ABS> The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the other two intervention groups.
<ABS> Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity, one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group.
<ABS> Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to raised alanine aminotransferase activity, over three times the upper normal limit.
<ABS> Both trials were at high risk of bias (that is, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).
<ABS> Furthermore, the groups were small raising the risks of random errors (that is, play of chance).
<ABS> Accordingly, we did not find evidence to support or refute the use of statins for patients with NAFLD or NASH.
<ABS> Further unbiased trials with larger numbers of patients looking explicitly at patient-related outcomes of interest (for example, quality of life, development of cirrhosis, and mortality) are needed to assess the effects of statins on NAFLD or NASH.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are common causes of elevated liver enzymes in the general population.
<INT> NASH and to some extent NAFLD have been associated with increased liver-related and all-cause mortality.
<INT> No effective treatment is yet available.
<INT> Recent reports have shown that the use of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with elevated plasma aminotransferases may result in normalisation of these liver enzymes.
<INT> Whether this is a consistent effect or whether it can lead to improved clinical outcomes beyond normalisation of abnormal liver enzymes is not clear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We performed a computerised literature search in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to March 2013.
<MaM> We did fully recursive searches from the reference lists of all retrieved relevant publications to ensure a complete and comprehensive search of the published literature.
<MaM> We did not apply any restrictions regarding language of publication or publication date.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were extracted, and risk of bias of each trial was assessed independently by two or more review authors.
<MaM> Meta-analyses were performed whenever possible.
<MaM> Review Manager 5.2 was used.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> When the described search method was used and the eligibility criteria of the search results were applied, 653 records were found.
<RES> Only two of these were randomised clinical trials that were considered eligible for inclusion.
<RES> We assessed both trials as trials with high risk of bias.
<RES> One of the trials was a pilot trial in which 16 participants with biopsy-proven NASH were randomised to receive simvastatin 40 mg (n = 10) or placebo (n = 6) once daily for 12 months.
<RES> No statistically significant improvement in the aminotransferase level was seen in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group.
<RES> Liver histology was not significantly affected by simvastatin.
<RES> The other trial had three arms.
<RES> The trial compared atorvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 63) versus fenofibrate 200 mg daily (n = 62) versus a group treated with a combination of the two interventions (n = 61).
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences between any of the three intervention groups regarding the week 54 mean activity levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase.
<RES> The triglyceride levels seemed higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group.
<RES> Liver histology was not assessed in this trial.
<RES> The presence of biochemical and ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD seemed to be higher in the fenofibrate group compared with the atorvastatin group (58% versus 33%).
<RES> Three patients discontinued treatment due to myalgia and elevated serum creatine kinase activity; one from the atorvastatin group and two from the combination group.
<RES> Another patient from the atorvastatin group discontinued treatment due to alanine aminotransferase activity that was over three times the upper normal limit.
<RES> No data for all-cause mortality and hepatic-related mortality were reported in the included trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Based on the findings of this review, which included two trials with high risk of bias and a small numbers of participants, it seems possible that statins may improve serum aminotransferase levels as well as ultrasound findings.
<CON> Neither of the trials reported on possible histological changes, liver-related morbidity or mortality.
<CON> Trials with larger sample sizes and low risk of bias are necessary before we may suggest statins as an effective treatment for patients with NASH.
<CON> However, as statins can improve the adverse outcomes of other conditions commonly associated with NASH (for example, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome), their use in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis may be justified.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibiotics for treating cholera

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of antibiotics for treating people with cholera.
<ABS> After searching for relevant trials, they included 39 randomized controlled trials enrolling 4623 people with cholera.
<ABS> What is cholera and how might antibiotics work
<ABS> Cholera is a form of severe watery diarrhoea, which spreads from person to person through food and water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
<ABS> Cholera is common in places with poor water and sanitation, and sometimes causes large epidemics with thousands of people falling ill.
<ABS> Cholera can cause severe dehydration and death, so the main treatment is to give fluids and salt either orally as oral rehydration salts, or by injection.
<ABS> By clearing the bacteria earlier than the patients own immune system, antibiotics could reduce the duration and severity of the illness, and reduce onward transmission to other people.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Antibiotic treatment shortened the duration of diarrhoea by about one and a half days (the normal duration is between three and four days), and reduced the total amount of diarrhoea fluid by half.
<ABS> Consequently, the need for rehydration fluids was also reduced by almost half.
<ABS> Antibiotic treatment also shortened the period of time where the patient remains contagious by reducing the duration of excretion of Vibrio cholerae in the diarrhoea.
<ABS> The benefits of antibiotics were seen in trials recruiting only people with severe dehydration, and in those recruiting people with mixed levels of dehydration.
<ABS> Tetracycline or azithromycin appear more effective than some of the other antibiotics tested, but the choice of which antibiotic to use will depend on local drug resistance.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cholera is an acute watery diarrhoea caused by infection with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which if severe can cause rapid dehydration and death.
<INT> Effective management requires early diagnosis and rehydration using oral rehydration salts or intravenous fluids.
<INT> In this review, we evaluate the additional benefits of treating cholera with antimicrobial drugs.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two reviewers independently applied inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extracted data from included trials.
<MaM> Diarrhoea duration and stool volume were defined as primary outcomes.
<MaM> We calculated mean difference (MD) or ratio of means (ROM) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and pooled data using a random-effects meta-analysis.
<MaM> The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirty-nine trials were included in this review with 4623 participants.
<RES> Antimicrobials versus placebo or no treatment
<RES> Overall, antimicrobial therapy shortened the mean duration of diarrhoea by about a day and a half compared to placebo or no treatment (MD -36.77 hours, 95% CI -43.51 to -30.03, 19 trials, 1013 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Antimicrobial therapy also reduced the total stool volume by 50% (ROM 0.5, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.56, 18 trials, 1042 participants, moderate quality evidence) and reduced the amount of rehydration fluids required by 40% (ROM 0.60, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.68, 11 trials, 1201 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The mean duration of fecal excretion of vibrios was reduced by almost three days (MD 2.74 days, 95% CI -3.07 to -2.40, 12 trials, 740 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity in the size of these benefits, probably due to differences in the antibiotic used, the trial methods (particularly effective randomization), and the timing of outcome assessment.
<RES> The benefits of antibiotics were seen both in trials recruiting only patients with severe dehydration and in those recruiting patients with mixed levels of dehydration.
<RES> Comparisons of antimicrobials
<RES> In head-to-head comparisons, there were no differences detected in diarrhoea duration or stool volume for tetracycline compared to doxycycline (three trials, 230 participants, very low quality evidence); or tetracycline compared to ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin (three trials, 259 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> In indirect comparisons with substantially more trials, tetracycline appeared to have larger benefits than doxycycline, norfloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the primary review outcomes.
<RES> Single dose azithromycin shortened the duration of diarrhoea by over a day compared to ciprofloxacin (MD -32.43, 95% CI -62.90 to -1.95, two trials, 375 participants, moderate quality evidence) and by half a day compared to erythromycin (MD -12.05, 95% CI -22.02 to -2.08, two trials, 179 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> It was not compared with tetracycline.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Azithromycin and tetracycline may have some advantages over other antibiotics.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Interventions for hyperthyroidism pre-pregnancy and during pregnancy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is a rare, serious condition which can increase the risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction.
<ABS> Pregnant women who are hyperthyroid may also develop severe pre-eclampsia or placental abruption.
<ABS> Most of these women have Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease most common in women aged 20 to 40 years.
<ABS> Most pregnant women with hyperthyroidism are diagnosed with thyroid disease prior to conception and will have previously received treatment for the condition.
<ABS> Generally only drug therapy is considered for treating pregnant women with hyperthyroidism.
<ABS> Radioiodine treatment is not used in pregnancy because it destroys the fetal thyroid gland, resulting in permanent hypothyroidism in the newborn.
<ABS> The main antithyroid drugs used are the thionamides, propylthiouracil (PTU), methimazole and carbimazole.
<ABS> PTU is currently the favoured drug for use in pregnancy, as it is associated with fewer teratogenic effects (scalp lesions) than methimazole.
<ABS> However, since there have been reports of liver damage in people taking PTU, it may be reasonable for pregnant hyperthyroid women to be treated with PTU in the first trimester (to reduce any teratogenic effects of methimazole) and then to change to methimazole.
<ABS> We did not identify any randomised trials to help inform women and their doctors about which antithyroid drugs are most effective, with the lowest potential for harm.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No trials were included in the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Designing and conducting a trial of antithyroid interventions for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism presents formidable challenges.
<CON> Not only is hyperthyroidism a relatively rare condition, both of the two main drugs used have potential for harm, one for the mother and the other for the child.
<CON> More observational research is required about the potential harms of methimazole in early pregnancy and about the potential liver damage from propylthiouracil.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We searched the medical literature databases to May 2013.
<ABS> In a single large trial of high methodologic quality that involved 300 patients, use of a system (SmartCare™) that automatically adjusted ventilator settings and conducted tests of patients' ability to breathe spontaneously there was no clear benefit of SmartCare™.
<ABS> While it reduced the time to undergo the first test of spontaneous breathing, it did not reduce the time to the first successful spontaneous breathing test compared to a written weaning protocol applied by physicians.
<ABS> There was no clear benefit of SmartCare™ on other clinically important outcomes including the time to successful discontinuation of artificial ventilation , the total duration of mechanical ventilation, the time spent in the intensive care unit and hospital, and the requirement for tracheostomy (an airway inserted into the trachea).
<ABS> Further studies are needed to clarify the role of SmartCare™ in the postoperative setting, in general, and in specific patient populations.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To summarize the evidence comparing automated weaning and SBT systems to non-automated mechanical ventilation strategies on time to mechanical ventilation discontinuation in adult postoperative patients.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and abstracted data according to prespecified criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified one randomized controlled trial of high quality, involving 300 patients , comparing SmartCare™ to a written protocol.
<RES> In this trial, SmartCare™ had no effect on discontinuation time.
<RES> While SmartCare™ significantly reduced the time to the first SBT (mean difference (MD) -0.34 days, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.08; P = 0.01) it did not reduce the time to the first successful SBT (MD -0.25 days, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.05; P = 0.10) and other clinically important outcomes.
<RES> SmartCare™ did not demonstrate beneficial effects on most clinically important outcomes including time to successful extubation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and the requirement for tracheostomy.
<RES> Moreover, SmartCare™ did not favourably impact reintubation, mortality, self-extubation, and the proportion of patients undergoing protracted mechanical ventilation, with a small numbers of events in this single trial.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials to support or refute use of automated weaning and SBT systems in discontinuing invasive mechanical ventilation in adult postoperative patients.
<CON> In a single large trial of high methodologic quality, while the use of SmartCare™ to adjust ventilator settings and conduct SBTs shortened the time to undergoing the first SBT, it did not reduce the time to the first successful SBT or the rate of tracheostomy compared to a written protocol implemented by physicians.
<CON> SmartCare™ did not demonstrate beneficial effects on clinically important outcomes including time to mechanical ventilation discontinuation, time to successful discontinuation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital lengths of stay.
<CON> Additional well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the role for SmartCare™ on important outcomes in patients who predominantly require short term ventilation and in specific postoperative patient populations.

<H1> Chinese herbal medicine for atopic eczema

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Atopic eczema (eczema in short) is a common skin condition, where skin changes occur and cause redness, scaling, swelling, and skin thickening due to chronic scratching.
<ABS> It is associated with loss of sleep, self-esteem, and quality of life.
<ABS> The frequency of eczema has increased over the past 10 years.
<ABS> A former Cochrane review published in 2004 found some evidence of a possible benefit of using oral Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for eczema; however, the results from only 4 included studies were inconclusive and need to be updated (those four studies have not been included in this update as they investigated a product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004).
<ABS> As well as updating that review, we have also widened the scope of the review to assess the effects of topical CHM for eczema.
<ABS> We wrote a new protocol to expand the scope of this review.
<ABS> This review included 28 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with 2306 children and adults, of which 4 compared CHM to placebo, 22 to conventional medications, and 2 to CHM taken by mouth.
<ABS> Most of the included studies reported a higher number of participants who had recovered and significantly improved, with less itching in the CHM groups than the control groups.
<ABS> Where CHM was compared to conventional drugs, although the total effectiveness rate outcome was superior with CHM, it was based on very low quality evidence.
<ABS> One study reported that the quality of life (QoL) score in the CHM group was better than in the placebo group after using a CHM formula taken by mouth for 12 weeks.
<ABS> We assessed most of the studies as at high 'risk of bias' and therefore not of good quality, and there was substantial inconsistency between the studies, so any positive effect in CHM must be treated with caution.
<ABS> One study reported one severe adverse event.
<ABS> Minor adverse events were observed in 24 studies, including temporary elevation of enzymes in 3 cases, which was reversed soon after stopping CHM.
<ABS> Eight included studies received government funding.
<ABS> We could not find conclusive evidence that CHM taken by mouth or applied to the skin was of benefit to children or adults with eczema.
<ABS> Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for eczema.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been increasingly used for atopic eczema.
<INT> A previous version of this Cochrane review published in 2004 found some evidence of a possible benefit for oral ingestion of CHM for eczema, but the results were inconclusive and the evidence needs to be updated.
<INT> We have expanded the scope of this review to include an assessment of the topical and oral effects of CHM for eczema.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of oral ingestion and topical applications of CHM for the management of eczema in children and adults.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases up to September 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981).
<MaM> We searched the following from inception: SCOPUS, HERBMED, ProQuest, CQVIP, CNKI, and Wanfang Data.
<MaM> We also searched trials registers, handsearched conference proceedings, checked the reference lists of all included and excluded studies and review articles for further references to relevant trials, and contacted experts in Chinese medicine for unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors selected the RCTs, extracted data, and assessed quality independently.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for missing data.
<MaM> We collected adverse events from the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 28 studies, with a total of 2306 participants.
<RES> We assessed most of the studies at high 'risk of bias', particularly in blinding of participants and personnel, and there was substantial inconsistency between studies, so any positive effect of CHM must be treated with caution.
<RES> We did not include the four studies from the previous version in this review, because they investigated a CHM product that has been withdrawn from the market since 2004.
<RES> Four studies (three oral and one topical) compared CHM to placebo.
<RES> Pooled data from 2 studies showed the total effectiveness rate in the CHM group was higher (by risk ratio (RR) 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32 to 3.32; 2 studies; n = 85), and the itching visual analogue score (VAS) in the CHM group was 1.53 lower (by standardised mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 2.64 to 0.41; 2 Studies; n = 94) than the placebo group, where a lower VAS score indicates reduced itch.
<RES> One study of 85 participants with moderate to severe eczema who received an oral CHM formula for 12 weeks reported a quality of life (QoL) score 2.5 lower in the CHM group (by difference in means (MD), 95% CI 4.77 to 0.23; 1 study; n = 85) than the placebo group, where a lower score indicates better QoL.
<RES> Twenty-two studies and 1 arm from a study with a 4-arm parallel controlled design compared CHM (5 oral, 6 topical, and 12 mixed oral and topical) to conventional medicines.
<RES> The total effectiveness rate in the CHM groups was superior (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.61; 21 studies; n = 1868; very low quality evidence), and the itching VAS in the CHM groups was 0.83 lower (SMD, 95% CI 1.43 to 0.22; 7 studies; n = 465) than the comparators.
<RES> Two studies compared combined oral and topical CHM to the same oral CHM formula alone.
<RES> The total effectiveness rate in 1 study was not statistically significant (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.63; 1 study; n = 20).
<RES> In the other study, the itching VAS in the CHM group was 1.05 lower (MD, 95% CI 1.75 to 0.35; 1 study; n = 23) than the control group.
<RES> With regard to side-effects, four studies did not give any report of adverse events.
<RES> The other 24 studies reported minor adverse events, which were reversed soon after stopping CHM.
<RES> One participant withdrew from one trial because of exacerbation of their condition after using the CHM intervention.
<RES> Eight studies received government funding.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for managing eczema.

<H1> Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Heart failure is a term used to describe the state that develops when the heart cannot maintain adequate cardiac output or can do so only at the expense of overfilling the heart chambers.
<ABS> People with heart failure commonly experience a relapsing and remitting disease course, with periods of stability and episodes of decompensation (failure to cope with heart damage) leading to worsening symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation.
<ABS> Treatment options for heart failure range from drugs to heart transplantation, with each having its own limitations.
<ABS> Coenzyme Q10 (or ubiquinone) has been suggested as a treatment option in some trials.
<ABS> Coenzyme Q10 is a non-prescription nutritional supplement.
<ABS> It is a fat-soluble molecule that has a role in energy production within the cells of the body.
<ABS> It may also have antioxidant properties.
<ABS> Low levels of conequme Q10 may be related to the severity of heart failure.
<ABS> Coenzyme Q10 has been found in all tissues and organs in the body, with the highest concentrations in the heart.
<ABS> Emerging data have suggested that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in patients with heart failure and coenzyme Q10, given its antioxidant activity, may help to reduce these toxic effects, which damage the components of the cardiac cells and disrupt cellular signalling.
<ABS> Coenzyme Q10 also has a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels and preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.
<ABS> The concentration of coenzyme Q10 has been inversely related to the severity of heart failure.
<ABS> Supplementation with coenzyme Q10 may improve heart failure.
<ABS> Coenzyme Q10 is sometimes used because it is thought to have an acceptable safety profile with no significant side effects.
<ABS> We conducted this review to assess the available evidence on the effects of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure patients.
<ABS> We included seven small randomised controlled trials in this review, that were at a risk of bias.
<ABS> Due to the variation in the way that the studies were done we were not able to combine many of the data in our review, meaning that it is difficult to explore the impact of this variation on the results of this review.
<ABS> Only one study reported on mortality, majro cardiovascular evetns and hospitalisation.
<ABS> The evidence collected in this review shows no clear effect of coenzyme Q10 on the improvement of clinical status (using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification) or on exercise capacity.
<ABS> There is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement.
<INT> It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes.
<INT> Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases including heart failure.
<INT> The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency.
<INT> Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in patients with heart failure and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity.
<INT> Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels and preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.
<INT> Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to patients with heart failure.
<INT> Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials has been conducted.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in patients with heart failure.
<MaM> When cross-over studies were identified, we considered data only from the first phase.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies onto a pre-designed data extraction form.
<MaM> We then entered the data into Review Manager 5.2 for analysis.
<MaM> We assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.
<MaM> For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio and for continuous data the mean difference (MD).
<MaM> Where appropriate data were available, we performed meta-analysis.
<MaM> For this review we prioritised data from pooled analyses only.
<MaM> Where meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis.
<MaM> We provided a QUOROM flow chart to show the flow of papers.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included seven studies with 914 participants comparing conenzyme Q10 versus placebo.
<RES> There were no data on clinical events from published randomised trials.
<RES> The included studies had small sample sizes.
<RES> Meta-analysis was only possible for a few physiological measures and there was substantial heterogeneity.
<RES> Only one study reported on total mortality, major cardiovascular events and hospitalisation.
<RES> Five trials reported on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of clinical status, but it was impossible to pool data due to heterogeneity.
<RES> None of the included trials considered quality of life, exercise variables, adverse events or cost-effectiveness as outcome measures.
<RES> Pooled analysis suggests that the use of coenzyme Q10 has no clear effect on left ventricular ejection fraction (MD -2.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.49 to 10.97, n = 60) or exercise capacity (MD 12.79; 95% CI -140.12 to 165.70, n = 85).
<RES> Pooled data did indicate that supplementation increased blood levels of coenzyme Q10 (MD 1.46; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.72, n = 112).
<RES> However, there are only a small number of small studies with a risk of bias, so these results should be interpreted with caution.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No conclusions can be drawn on the benefits or harms of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure at this time as trials published to date lack information on clinically relevant endpoints.
<CON> Furthermore, the existing data are derived from small, heterogeneous trials that concentrate on physiological measures: their results are inconclusive.
<CON> Until further evidence emerges to support the use of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure, there might be a need to re-evaluate whether further trials testing coenzyme Q10 in heart failure are desirable.

<H1> Behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is one of the common mental illnesses characterised by persistent low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms, including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death.
<ABS> Whilst antidepressants remain the mainstay of treatment for depression in healthcare settings, psychological therapies are still important alternative or additional interventions for depressive disorders.
<ABS> Nowadays, a diverse range of psychological therapies are available (such as cognitive-behavioural therapies, behavioural therapies, psychodynamic therapies, humanistic therapies and integrative therapies).
<ABS> It is very important to know whether one type of psychological therapy is more effective than another, and to know which psychological therapy is the most effective treatment for depression.
<ABS> In this review, we focused on one of these—behavioural therapies (BT)—because they are relatively simple to deliver, and interest in them has recently been renewed.
<ABS> Behavioural therapies are usually based purely on operant and respondent principles, aimed to change the patient's depressive mood by changing his or her behaviour patterns.
<ABS> Whilst a number of BT models have been developed, we categorised the following approaches as behavioural therapies in this review: behavioural therapy (based on Lewinsohn's model, which focused on increasing pleasant activities), behavioural activation (originated from behavioural component of cognitive-behavioural therapy and based on Jacobson's work in 1996), social skills training/assertiveness training and relaxation therapy.
<ABS> In this review, we assessed the efficacy and acceptability of behavioural therapies compared with all other psychological therapies in the treatment of acute phase depression (neither long-term nor treatment-resistant depression) in adults.
<ABS> Twenty-five randomised controlled trails were included in this review.
<ABS> The quality of evidence in our review is low because of issues with the design of the studies that we found and lack of precision in our results.
<ABS> Although we found that behavioural therapies and all other psychological therapies are equally effective and acceptable, more research is needed to confirm this finding.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Behavioural therapies represent one of several categories of psychological therapies that are currently used in the treatment of depression.
<INT> However, the effectiveness and acceptability of behavioural therapies for depression compared with other psychological therapies remain unclear.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> To examine the effects of all BT approaches compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> 3.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, 31/07/2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-).
<MaM> We also searched CINAHL (May 2010) and PSYNDEX (June 2010) and reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two or more review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-five trials involving 955 participants compared behavioural therapies with one or more of five other major categories of psychological therapies (cognitive-behavioural, third wave cognitive-behavioural, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies).
<RES> Most studies had a small sample size and were assessed as being at unclear or high risk of bias.
<RES> Compared with all other psychological therapies together, behavioural therapies showed no significant difference in response rate (18 studies, 690 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.09) or in acceptability (15 studies, 495 participants, RR of total dropout rate 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.61).
<RES> Similarly, in comparison with each of the other classes of psychological therapies, low-quality evidence showed better response to cognitive-behavioural therapies than to behavioural therapies (15 studies, 544 participants, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05) and low-quality evidence of better response to behavioural therapies over psychodynamic therapies (2 studies, 110 participants, RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.82).
<RES> When compared with integrative therapies and humanistic therapies, only one study was included in each comparison, and the analysis showed no significant difference between behavioural therapies and integrative or humanistic therapies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found low- to moderate-quality evidence that behavioural therapies and other psychological therapies are equally effective.
<CON> The current evidence base that evaluates the relative benefits and harms of behavioural therapies is very weak.
<CON> This limits our confidence in both the size of the effect and its precision for our key outcomes related to response and withdrawal.
<CON> Studies recruiting larger samples with improved reporting of design and fidelity to treatment would improve the quality of evidence in this review.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is a very common condition, in which people experience persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death.
<ABS> Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression.
<ABS> Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including behavioural, cognitive-behavioural (CBT), 'third wave' CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies.
<ABS> In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT) to help people become aware of their thoughts and accept them in a non-judgemental way.
<ABS> The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was more effective and acceptable than other psychological therapy approaches for people with acute depression.
<ABS> The review included three studies, involving a total of 144 people.
<ABS> The studies examined two different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (two studies) and extended behavioural activation (BA) (one study).
<ABS> All three studies compared these third wave CBT approaches with CBT.
<ABS> The results suggested that third wave CBT and CBT approaches were equally effective in treating depression.
<ABS> Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are more helpful than other psychological therapies in treating people with acute depression.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.

<OBJ> 3.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Specialised Register (CCDANCTR to 01/01/12), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-).
<MaM> We also searched CINAHL (May 2010) and PSYNDEX (June 2010) and reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished studies.
<MaM> An updated search of CCDANCTR restricted to search terms relevant to third wave CBT was conducted in March 2013 (CCDANCTR to 01/02/13).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information where required.
<MaM> We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of three studies involving 144 eligible participants were included in the review.
<RES> Two of the studies (56 participants) compared an early version of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with CBT, and one study (88 eligible participants) compared extended behavioural activation with CBT.
<RES> No other studies of third wave CBT were identified.
<RES> The two ACT studies were assessed as being at high risk of performance bias and researcher allegiance.
<RES> Post-treatment results, which were based on dropout rates, showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for the primary outcomes of efficacy (risk ratio (RR) of clinical response 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.64; very low quality) and acceptability.
<RES> Results at two-month follow-up showed no evidence of any difference between third wave CBT and other psychological therapies for clinical response (2 studies, 56 participants, RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.15).
<RES> Moderate statistical heterogeneity was indicated in the acceptability analyses (I2 = 41%).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT and CBT approaches are equally effective and acceptable in the treatment of acute depression.
<CON> Evidence is limited in quantity, quality and breadth of available studies, precluding us from drawing any conclusions as to their short- or longer-term equivalence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Major depression is a very common condition in which people experience a persistently low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities, accompanied by a range of symptoms including weight loss, insomnia, fatigue, loss of energy, inappropriate guilt, poor concentration and morbid thoughts of death.
<ABS> Psychological therapies are an important and popular alternative to antidepressants in the treatment of depression.
<ABS> Many different psychological therapy approaches have been developed over the past century, including cognitive-behavioural (CBT), behavioural, 'third wave' CBT, psychodynamic, humanistic and integrative therapies.
<ABS> In this review, we focused on third wave CBT approaches, a group of psychological therapies that target the process of thoughts (rather than their content, as in CBT), helping people to become aware of their thoughts and to accept them in a non-judgemental way.
<ABS> The aim of the review was to find out whether third wave CBT was effective and acceptable to people in the acute phase of depression.
<ABS> The review included four studies, involving a total of 224 people.
<ABS> The studies examined three different forms of third wave CBT, consisting of extended behavioural activation (two studies), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) (one study) and another form of third wave CBT called competitive mind training (one study).
<ABS> Three of the studies compared third wave CBT approaches with treatment as usual control conditions.
<ABS> The fourth study compared ACT with a psychological placebo condition.
<ABS> The results suggested that third wave CBT approaches were effective on a short-term basis in treating depression.
<ABS> However, the quality of evidence was very low because of the small number of studies/participants included in the review, together with the diverse client groups, interventions and control conditions used and possible allegiance of researchers towards the active treatments, making it difficult to draw conclusions with any confidence.
<ABS> It is notable, too, that none of the studies looked at the long-term effect of third wave CBT approaches.
<ABS> Given the increasing popularity of third wave CBT approaches in clinical practice, further well-designed studies should be prioritised to establish whether third wave CBT approaches are helpful in treating people with acute depression.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> 2.
<OBJ> 3.
<OBJ> To examine the effects of all third wave CBT approaches compared with different types of comparators (treatment as usual, no treatment, waiting list, attention placebo, psychological placebo) for acute depression.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis Group Trials Specialised Register (CCDANCTR to 01/01/12), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE, (1974-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1967-).
<MaM> We also searched CINAHL (May 2010) and PSYNDEX (June 2010) and reference lists of the included studies and relevant reviews for additional published and unpublished studies.
<MaM> An updated search of CCDANCTR restricted to search terms relevant to third wave CBT therapies was conducted in March 2013 (CCDANCTR to 01/02/13).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information when required.
<MaM> We rated the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four small studies (224 participants) were included in the review.
<RES> Little information was provided about the process of allocating participants to groups.
<RES> None of the studies used independent outcome assessors, and evidence suggested researcher allegiance towards the active treatments.
<RES> The four studies examined a diversity of third wave CBT approaches (extended behavioural activation, acceptance and commitment therapy and competitive memory training) and control conditions.
<RES> None of the studies conducted follow-up assessments.
<RES> The results showed a significant difference in clinical response rates in favour of third wave CBT when compared with treatment as usual (TAU) conditions (three studies, 170 participants, risk ratio (RR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.95; very low quality).
<RES> No significant difference in treatment acceptability based on dropout rates was found between third wave CBT approaches and TAU (four studies, 224 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.08 to 12.30; very low quality).
<RES> Both analyses showed substantial statistical heterogeneity.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Very low quality evidence suggests that third wave CBT approaches appear to be more effective than treatment as usual in the treatment of acute depression.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stress urinary incontinence (leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on coughing, sneezing or laughing) is a common condition that affects up to one in three women worldwide.
<ABS> It is usually the result of weakening of the muscular support of the pipe that conducts urine (urethra), or weakening of the sphincter (circular) muscle at the base of the bladder, which maintains continence.
<ABS> It is more common in women who have had children by vaginal delivery and in those who have weakness in the pelvic floor muscles for other reasons.
<ABS> Historically many types of surgery have been performed to treat women with stress urinary incontinence.
<ABS> Over the past 10 years, the accepted standard technique has been the mid-urethral sling operation, whereby an artificial tape or mesh is placed directly beneath the urethra and is anchored to the tissues in adjacent parts of the groin or just above the pubic bone.
<ABS> Examples of such slings that are commonly used are tension-free vaginal tape (TVTTM) and transobturator tape (TOT).
<ABS> These operations are usually quite successful, with success rates approaching 80% or 90%.
<ABS> However, they have been shown to result in significant side effects, which can be bothersome and sometimes even dangerous, such as damage to the bladder caused by tape insertion, erosion of the tape into the urethra during the healing period or chronic thigh/groin pain.
<ABS> In an effort to maintain efficacy while eliminating some of the side effects, a new generation of slings has been developed, called 'single-incision slings' or 'mini-slings'; these slings are the subject of this review.
<ABS> They are designed to be shorter (in length) than standard mid-urethral slings and do not penetrate the tissues as deeply as standard slings.
<ABS> It was therefore thought that they would cause fewer side effects while being no less effective.
<ABS> Examples of single-incision slings include TVT-Secur, MiniArc, Ajust and Needleless slings, among others.
<ABS> We looked for all trials that allocated participants at random to single-incision slings versus any other treatment for stress incontinence in women, especially comparisons with mid-urethral slings.
<ABS> We identified a total of 31 trials, involving 3290 women, all of which compared a type of single-incision sling versus a type of mid-urethral sling, or different types of single-incision slings against each other.
<ABS> Overall the quality of the trials was moderate.
<ABS> We found that subtle differences in the way individual mini-slings work have sometimes made comparisons difficult.
<ABS> TVT-Secur is a specific type of mini-sling that has consistently been shown to provide poorer control of incontinence, along with higher rates of side effects, compared with standard mid-urethral slings.
<ABS> It has already been withdrawn from clinical use.
<ABS> As most trials currently available for inclusion in this review assess TVT-Secur, trials comparing other single-incision slings versus standard mid-urethral slings were too few to allow meaningful comparisons.
<ABS> Some evidence suggests that single-incision slings were quicker to perform and may cause less postoperative pain, but more trials are needed to adequately assess whether the other types of mini-slings are in fact as good as or safer than standard mid-urethral slings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Urinary incontinence has been shown to affect up to 50% of women.
<INT> Studies in the United States have shown that up to 80% of these women have an element of stress urinary incontinence.
<INT> Colposuspension and now mid-urethral slings have been shown to be effective in treating patients with stress incontinence.
<INT> However, associated adverse events include bladder and bowel injury, groin pain and haematoma formation.
<INT> This has led to the development of third-generation single-incision slings, also referred to as mini-slings.
<INT> It should be noted that TVT-Secur (Gynecare, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) is one type of single-incision sling; it has been withdrawn from the market because of poor results.
<INT> However, it is one of the most widely studied single-incision slings and was used in several of the trials included in this review.
<INT> Despite its withdrawal from clinical use, it was decided that data pertaining to this sling should be included in the first iteration of this review, so that level 1a data are available in the literature to confirm its lack of efficacy.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in women with urodynamic stress incontinence, symptoms of stress incontinence or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence, in which at least one trial arm involves one of the new single-incision slings.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 31 trials involving 3290 women.
<RES> Some methodological flaws were observed in some trials; a summary of these is given in the 'Risk of bias in included studies' section.
<RES> No studies compared single-incision slings versus no treatment, conservative treatment, colposuspension, laparoscopic procedures or traditional sub-urethral slings.
<RES> Also no data on the comparison of single-incision slings versus retropubic mid-urethral slings (top-down approach) were available, but the review authors believe this did not affect the overall comparison versus retropubic mid-urethral slings.
<RES> The types of single-incision slings included in this review were TVT-Secur (Gynecare), MiniArc (American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, MN, USA), Ajust (C.R. Bard, Inc.,Covington, GA, USA), Needleless (Mayumana Healthcare, Lisse, The Netherlands), Ophira (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina), Tissue Fixation System (TFS PTY Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and CureMesh (D.Med.
<RES> Co., Inc., Seoul, Korea).
<RES> Women were more likely to remain incontinent after surgery with single-incision slings than with retropubic slings such as tension-free vaginal tape (TVTTM) (121/292, 41% vs 72/281, 26%; risk ratio (RR) 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 4.14).
<RES> Duration of the operation was slightly shorter for single-incision slings but with higher risk of de novo urgency (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.56).
<RES> Four of five studies in the comparison included TVT-Secur as the single-incision sling.
<RES> Single-incision slings resulted in higher incontinence rates compared with inside-out transobturator slings (30% vs 11%; RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.93 to 3.36).
<RES> The adverse event profile was significantly worse, specifically consisting of higher risks of vaginal mesh exposure (RR 3.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 9.86), bladder/urethral erosion (RR 17.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 298.88) and operative blood loss (mean difference 18.79, 95% CI 3.70 to 33.88).
<RES> Postoperative pain was less common with single-incision slings (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.43), and rates of long-term pain or discomfort were marginally lower, but the clinical significance of these differences is questionable.
<RES> Most of these findings were derived from the trials involving TVT-Secur: Excluding the other trials showed that high risk of incontinence was principally associated with use of this device (RR 2.65, 95% CI 1.98 to 3.54).
<RES> It has been withdrawn from clinical use.
<RES> Evidence was insufficient to reveal a difference in incontinence rates with other single-incision slings compared with inside-out or outside-in transobturator slings.
<RES> Duration of the operation was marginally shorter for single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings, but only by approximately two minutes and with significant heterogeneity in the comparison.
<RES> Risks of postoperative and long-term groin/thigh pain were slightly lower with single-incision slings, but overall evidence was insufficient to suggest a significant difference in the adverse event profile for single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings.
<RES> Evidence was also insufficient to permit a meaningful sensitivity analysis of the other single-incision slings compared with transobturator slings, as all confidence intervals were wide.
<RES> The only significant differences were observed in rates of postoperative and long-term pain, and in duration of the operation, which marginally favoured single-incision slings.
<RES> Overall results show that TVT-Secur is considerably inferior to retropubic and inside-out transobturator slings, but additional evidence is required to allow any reasonable comparison of other single-incision slings versus transobturator slings.
<RES> When one single-incision sling was compared with another, evidence was insufficient to suggest a significant difference between any of the slings in any of the comparisons made.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> TVT-Secur is inferior to standard mid-urethral slings for the treatment of women with stress incontinence and has already been withdrawn from clinical use.
<CON> Additional adequately powered and high-quality trials with longer-term follow-up are required.
<CON> Trials should clearly describe the fixation mechanism of these single-incisions slings: It is apparent that, although clubbed together as a single group, a significant difference in fixation mechanisms may influence outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The main question addressed by this review is how effective are fixed braces or removable retainers for managing relapse of lower front teeth after orthodontic treatment, compared to each other or no treatment.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> An important problem for patients completing orthodontic treatment is maintaining their lower front teeth in the corrected position (known as managing relapse) and preventing teeth from returning to their original positions.
<ABS> After orthodontic treatment, less than half of patients maintain alignment of their lower front teeth for the next 10 years, and even fewer (10%) maintain alignment for 20 years.
<ABS> Managing relapse is important in order to avoid wasting time, money and resources, and to maintain both the appearance and function of well-aligned teeth.
<ABS> There are two types of appliances (retainers) used to manage relapse; retainers which are fixed to the teeth or retainers able to be removed for cleaning.
<ABS> The most commonly used fixed retainers are:
<ABS> • normal braces that have brackets attached to the lips-side of teeth (labial braces);• braces with brackets attached to the tongue-side of teeth (lingual braces); or• a fixed flexible wire attached to the tongue-side of teeth without using brackets.
<ABS> The most common removable retainers are:
<ABS> • retainers made from wire and acrylic (Hawley’s retainer), with or without the addition of springs to apply force; or• clear 'invisible' aligners, free from metal brackets and wires, which are computer-generated to fit over the patient's lower teeth and move teeth in order.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review of existing studies was carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group and the evidence is current up to 9 November 2012.
<ABS> In this review there are no trials published between 1950 and 2012 in which patients were randomly treated with either fixed braces, removable retainers or no treatment.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> No trials were found that were suitable for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Currently there is no evidence to support using one form of treatment for managing relapse over another.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Orthodontic relapse can be defined as the tendency for teeth to return to their pre-treatment position, and this occurs especially in lower front teeth (lower canines and lower incisors).
<INT> Retention, to maintain the position of corrected teeth, has become one of the most important phases of orthodontic treatment.
<INT> However, 10 years after the completion of orthodontic treatment, only 30% to 50% of orthodontic patients effectively retain the satisfactory alignment initially obtained.
<INT> After 20 years, satisfactory alignment reduces to 10%.
<INT> When relapse occurs, simple effective strategies are required to effectively manage the problem.
<INT> The periodontal, physiological or psychological conditions may be different from those before orthodontic treatment, so re-treatment methods may also need to be different.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 9 November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 10), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 9 November 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 9 November 2012).
<MaM> There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.
<MaM> A thorough handsearch was done in relation to the following journals: American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics (1970 to 9 November 2012), Angle Orthodontist (1978 to 9 November 2012), European Journal of Orthodontics (1979 to 9 November 2012), Journal of Orthodontics (1978 to 9 November 2012), Chinese Journal of Stomatology (1953 to 9 November 2012), West China Journal of Stomatology (1983 to 9 November 2012), Chinese Journal of Dental Materials and Devices (1992 to 9 November 2012) and Chinese Journal of Orthodontics (1994 to 9 November 2012).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We excluded RCTs of participants with craniofacial deformities/syndromes or serious skeletal deformities who received prior surgical/surgical orthodontic treatment.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors, independently and in duplicate, assessed the results of the searches to identify studies for inclusion.
<MaM> The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were to be followed for data synthesis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is an urgent need for RCTs in this area to identify the most effective and safe method for managing the relapse of alignment of the lower front teeth.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder are also called repetitive strain injury or occupational overuse syndrome.
<ABS> They are a burden for individual workers, for their employers and for society at large because they impair functioning both in daily life and at work.
<ABS> Studies included in the review
<ABS> We included randomised controlled studies of all possible treatments such as exercises, ergonomic adjustments at the workplace, massage and manual therapy.
<ABS> These treatments aim to reduce pain and improve functioning, and they can be provided by general practitioners or physiotherapists.
<ABS> We excluded injections and surgical procedures that invade the body and require more special skills.
<ABS> We included studies only if the authors wrote that the people they studied had complaints that were work-related.
<ABS> We searched electronic databases up until May 2013.
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We found 44 studies that included 6,580 persons.
<ABS> Twenty-one studies evaluated exercises, 13 evaluated ergonomic workplace adjustments and nine behavioural interventions.
<ABS> We combined the results of these studies per category.
<ABS> Eight other studies evaluated various other treatments.
<ABS> We did not find a consistent effect of any treatment on pain, recovery, disability or sick leave.
<ABS> Ergonomic interventions reduced pain in the long term but not in the short term in several studies.
<ABS> We judged nine studies to be of high quality, but the results were very inconsistent.
<ABS> We found no reason for the variation in study results.
<ABS> Better studies are needed that are bigger, have a clearer diagnosis of work-relatedness and comply with reporting guidelines.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Work-related CANS, which is the term we use in this review, severely hampers the working population.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We did not apply any language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials evaluating conservative interventions for work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder in adults.
<MaM> We excluded trials undertaken to test injections and surgery.
<MaM> We included studies that evaluated effects on pain, functional status or work ability.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies.
<MaM> When studies were sufficiently similar, we performed statistical pooling of reported results.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 44 studies (62 publications) with 6,580 participants that evaluated 25 different interventions.
<RES> We categorised these interventions according to their working mechanisms into exercises, ergonomics, behavioural and other interventions.
<RES> Overall, we judged 35 studies as having a high risk of bias mainly because of an unknown randomisation procedure, lack of a concealed allocation procedure, unblinded trial participants or lack of an intention-to-treat analysis.
<RES> We found very low-quality evidence showing that exercises did not improve pain in comparison with no treatment (five studies, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.08 to 0.03), or minor intervention controls (three studies, SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.37) or when provided as additional treatment (two studies, inconsistent results) at short-term follow-up or at long-term follow-up.
<RES> Results were similar for recovery, disability and sick leave.
<RES> Specific exercises led to increased pain at short-term follow-up when compared with general exercises (four studies, SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.75)
<RES> We found very low-quality evidence indicating that ergonomic interventions did not lead to a decrease in pain when compared with no intervention at short-term follow-up (three studies, SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.22) but did decrease pain at long-term follow-up (four studies, SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.16).
<RES> There was no effect on disability but sick leave decreased in two studies (risk ratio (RR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76).
<RES> None of the ergonomic interventions was more beneficial for any outcome measures when compared with another treatment or with no treatment or with placebo.
<RES> Behavioural interventions had inconsistent effects on pain and disability, with some subgroups showing benefit and others showing no significant improvement when compared with no treatment, minor intervention controls or other behavioural interventions.
<RES> In the eight studies that evaluated various other interventions, there was no evidence of a clear beneficial effect of any of the interventions provided.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found very low-quality evidence indicating that pain, recovery, disability and sick leave are similar after exercises when compared with no treatment, with minor intervention controls or with exercises provided as additional treatment to people with work-related complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder.
<CON> Low-quality evidence also showed that ergonomic interventions did not decrease pain at short-term follow-up but did decrease pain at long-term follow-up.
<CON> There was no evidence of an effect on other outcomes.
<CON> For behavioural and other interventions, there was no evidence of a consistent effect on any of the outcomes.
<CON> Studies are needed that include more participants, that are clear about the diagnosis of work-relatedness and that report findings according to current guidelines.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with many uncertainties in all phases of the disease.
<ABS> For example, the significance of a diagnosis for the future disease course remains unclear as up to one third of people will experience a benign disease course with little or even no disability progression.
<ABS> Uncertainty is also present for the effects and adverse effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.
<ABS> People with MS want to receive accurate, recent and relevant information in order to make informed choices on all relevant disease-related decisions and also on personal life planning decisions.
<ABS> For this, balanced information is a prerequisite.
<ABS> The methodological quality of the studies varied.
<ABS> Topics included disease-modifying therapy, relapse management, self-care strategies, fatigue management, family planning and general health promotion.
<ABS> The four studies assessing the level of knowledge showed that information may successfully increase patients’ knowledge (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> There were mixed results from four studies reporting on the effects on decision making (low quality evidence) and from five studies assessing quality of life (low quality evidence).
<ABS> As the studies and the interventions used differed markedly, and the quality of the evidence for our outcomes was not high, the results do not allow for a clear conclusion about the effectiveness of information provision interventions for people with MS.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are confronted with a number of important uncertainties concerning many aspects of the disease.
<INT> Among others, these include diagnosis, prognosis, disease course, disease-modifying therapies, symptomatic therapies and non-pharmacological interventions.
<INT> It has been shown that people with MS demand adequate information to be able to actively participate in medical decision making and to self-manage their disease.
<INT> On the other hand, it has been found that patients’ disease-related knowledge is poor.
<INT> Therefore, guidelines have recommended clear and concise high-quality information at all stages of the disease.
<INT> Several studies have outlined communication and information deficits in the care of people with MS and, accordingly, a number of information and decision support programmes have been published.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In addition, we searched PsycINFO, trial registries, and reference lists of identified articles.
<MaM> We also contacted trialists.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> Critical appraisal of studies addressed the risk of selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias and detection bias.
<MaM> We contacted authors of relevant studies for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten randomised controlled trials involving a total of 1314 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analysed.
<RES> The interventions addressed a variety of topics using different approaches for information provision in different settings.
<RES> All interventions were complex interventions using more than one active component, but the number and extent of the intervention components differed markedly between studies.
<RES> The studies had a variable risk of bias.
<RES> We did not perform meta-analyses due to marked clinical heterogeneity.
<RES> All four studies assessing MS-related knowledge (524 participants; moderate-quality evidence) detected significant differences between groups as a result of the interventions indicating that information provision may successfully increase participants’ knowledge.
<RES> There were mixed results from four studies reporting effects on decision making (836 participants; low-quality evidence) and from five studies assessing quality of life (605 participants; low-quality evidence).
<RES> There were no adverse events in the six studies reporting on adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease-related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life.
<CON> There seem to be no negative side effects from informing patients about their disease.
<CON> Interpretation of study results remains challenging due to the marked heterogeneity of the interventions and outcome measures.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death in women worldwide.
<ABS> After completing treatment for cervical cancer, women are followed-up at regular intervals by their doctor/healthcare professional to identify whether the cancer has come back or has continued to grow even before the woman experiences symptoms of this.
<ABS> Follow-up also helps doctors to monitor for side effects that have happened because of the treatment.
<ABS> Currently, women in the UK usually have follow-up appointments every three months for one year, every six months for the next two years and then yearly for five years after completion of treatment.
<ABS> The idea behind these follow-up appointments is that women will receive prompt treatment if the cancer has come back, and this will improve their survival from the cancer and their quality of life.
<ABS> Evidence from RCTs is needed to ascertain whether this is the case.
<ABS> If it is, we also need to know how often it is best for women to have follow-up appointments, which healthcare professional should conduct the follow-up and what should happen at follow-up appointments, for example, what investigations would be useful.
<ABS> In this review, we searched for randomised controlled trials that compared different follow-up approaches after first treatment for cervical cancer.
<ABS> We aimed to compare follow-up that is medical or nurse-led and is set down in a written procedure versus follow-up that is medical or nurse-led but responsive to the needs of women rather than being written in a procedure and delivered at pre-set times.
<ABS> We also wished to compare these types of follow-up versus follow-up initiated by the patient.
<ABS> Although we checked 1,377 titles and abstracts, we found no relevant trials that met the inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Therefore, no evidence is available to suggest that any form of follow-up approach is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, improving quality of life or guiding the management of problems that can arise because of the treatment and that in the case of radiotherapy treatment worsen with time.
<ABS> This review highlights the need for good quality studies to compare different follow-up approaches after first-line treatment for cervical cancer.
<ABS> This information will be needed in the future to help women and healthcare professionals plan effective follow-up care after treatment for cervical cancer has been completed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide.
<INT> Although surveillance of women after completion of primary treatment for cervical cancer is purported to have an impact on their overall survival (OS), no strictly defined follow-up protocols are available for these women.
<INT> Wide diversity in management has been noted in the follow-up of women who have completed primary treatment for cervical cancer.
<INT> Traditionally, women treated for cervical cancer undergo routine long-term, even life-long, follow-up.
<INT> The primary objective of this practice has been to detect and treat recurrence early.
<INT> This review sets out to systematically evaluate available evidence for the role of different models of follow-up after cervical cancer and the optimal use of investigations.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group (CGCG) Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to January 2013.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of clinical guidelines and review articles and contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> No trials were found, and therefore no data were analysed.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence to inform decisions about different follow-up protocols after primary treatment for women with cervical cancer.
<CON> Ideally, a large RCT or, at the very least, well-designed non-randomised studies (NRSs) that use multi-variate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances are needed to compare these follow-up protocols.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally.
<ABS> A diagnosis of the pre-dementia phase of disease is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach.
<ABS> A range of tests have been developed which healthcare professionals can use to assess people with poor memory or cognitive impairment.
<ABS> In this review, however, we have found that measuring protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF amyloid beta (Aβ40) or CSF Aβ42), as a single test, lacks the accuracy to identify those patients with mild cognitive impairment who would develop Alzheimer's disease dementia or other forms of dementia.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> These tests, added to core clinical criteria, might increase the sensitivity or specificity of a testing strategy.
<INT> However, the accuracy of biomarkers in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease dementia and other dementias has not yet been systematically evaluated.
<INT> A formal systematic evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and other properties of plasma and CSF amyloid beta (Aß) biomarkers was performed.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The most recent search for this review was performed on 3 December 2012.
<MaM> We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and LILACS (BIREME).
<MaM> We also requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (managed by the Cochrane Renal Group).
<MaM> No language or date restrictions were applied to the electronic searches and methodological filters were not used so as to maximise sensitivity.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Moreover, studies were only selected if they applied a reference standard for Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis, for example the NINCDS-ADRDA or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the abstracts of all potentially relevant studies.
<MaM> We assessed the identified full papers for eligibility and extracted data to create standard two by two tables.
<MaM> Two independent assessors performed quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool.
<MaM> Where data allowed, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in 14 studies using CSF Aß42.
<RES> Of the 1349 participants included in the meta-analysis, 436 developed Alzheimer’s dementia.
<RES> Individual study estimates of sensitivity were between 36% and 100% while the specificities were between 29% and 91%.
<RES> Because of the variation in assay thresholds, we did not estimate summary sensitivity and specificity.
<RES> However, we derived estimates of sensitivity at fixed values of specificity from the model we fitted to produce the summary ROC curve.
<RES> At the median specificity of 64%, the sensitivity was 81% (95% CI 72 to 87).
<RES> This equated to a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 2.22 (95% CI 2.00 to 2.47) and a negative likelihood ratio (LR–) of 0.31 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.48).
<RES> The accuracy of CSF Aß42 for all forms of dementia was evaluated in four studies.
<RES> The sensitivities were between 56% and 75% while the specificities were between 47% and 76%.
<RES> At the median specificity of 75%, the sensitivity was estimated to be 63% (95% CI 22 to 91) from the meta-analytic model.
<RES> This equated to a LR+ of 2.51 (95% CI 1.30 to 4.86) and a LR– of 0.50 (95% CI 0.16 to 1.51).
<RES> The accuracy of CSF Aß42 for non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was evaluated in three studies.
<RES> Of the 385 participants examined, 61 developed non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.
<RES> Since there were very few studies and considerable variation between studies, the results were not meta-analysed.
<RES> The sensitivities were between 8% and 63% while the specificities were between 35% and 67%.
<RES> Only one study examined the accuracy of plasma Aß42 and the plasma Aß42/Aß40 ratio for Alzheimer's disease dementia.
<RES> The sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 81 to 90) was the same for both tests while the specificities were 50% (95% CI 44 to 55) and 70% (95% CI 64 to 75) for plasma Aß42 and the plasma Aß42/Aß40 ratio respectively.
<RES> Of the 565 participants examined, 245 developed Alzheimer’s dementia and 87 non-Alzheimer's disease dementia.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity between studies.
<RES> The accuracy of Aß42 for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease dementia did not differ significantly (P = 0.8) between studies that pre-specified the threshold for determining test positivity (n = 6) and those that only determined the threshold at follow-up (n = 8).
<RES> One study excluded a sample of MCI non-Alzheimer's disease dementia converters from their analysis.
<RES> In sensitivity analyses, the exclusion of this study had no impact on our findings.
<RES> The exclusion of eight studies (950 patients) that were considered at high (n = 3) or unclear (n = 5) risk of bias for the patient selection domain also made no difference to our findings.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> From our review, the measure of abnormally low CSF Aß levels has very little diagnostic benefit with likelihood ratios suggesting only marginal clinical utility.
<CON> The quality of reports was also poor, and thresholds and length of follow-up were inconsistent.
<CON> We conclude that when applied to a population of patients with MCI, CSF Aß levels cannot be recommended as an accurate test for Alzheimer's disease.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The 'Theory of Mind' model suggests that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a profound difficulty understanding the minds of other people, their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and thoughts.
<ABS> It has been proposed that this may underlie many of the other difficulties experienced by people with ASD, including social and communication problems, and some challenging behaviours.
<ABS> Therefore, a number of studies have attempted to teach theory of mind and related skills to people with ASD.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review aimed to explore whether a) it is possible to teach theory of mind skills to people with autism and b) whether or not this evidence supports the theory of mind model.
<ABS> Having a 'theory of mind' may depend on developing related basic skills, including joint attention (sharing a focus of interest with another person), recognising other people's emotions from faces or stories, and imitating other people.
<ABS> Therefore, we included intervention studies that taught not just theory of mind itself, but also related skills.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found 22 research studies involving 695 participants, which reported on the efficacy of interventions related to theory of mind.
<ABS> The evidence is current to 7th August 2013.
<ABS> Key results and the quality of the evidence
<ABS> Despite all studies using a high-quality basic methodology (the randomised controlled trial), there was concern over poor study design and reporting in some aspects.
<ABS> While there is some evidence that theory of mind, or related skills, can be taught to people with ASD, there is currently poor quality  evidence that these skills can be maintained, generalised to other settings, or that teaching theory of mind has an impact on developmentally-linked abilities.
<ABS> For example, it was rare for a taught skill to generalise to a new context, such as sharing attention with a new adult who was not the therapist during the intervention.
<ABS> New skills were not necessarily maintained over time.
<ABS> This evidence could imply that the theory of mind model has little relevance for educational and clinical practice in ASD.
<ABS> Further research using longitudinal methods, better outcome measures, and higher standards of reporting is needed to throw light on the issues.
<ABS> This is particularly important as the specific details of the theory of mind model continue to evolve.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The 'Theory of Mind' (ToM) model suggests that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have a profound difficulty understanding the minds of other people - their emotions, feelings, beliefs, and thoughts.
<INT> As an explanation for some of the characteristic social and communication behaviours of people with ASD, this model has had a significant influence on research and practice.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In August 2013 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Social Services Abstracts, AutismData, and two trials registers.
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers, contacted authors who work in this field, and handsearched a number of journals.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies were selected by two review authors independently and a third author arbitrated when necessary.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Risk of bias was evaluated and data were extracted by two review authors independently; a third author arbitrated when necessary.
<MaM> Three small meta-analyses were carried out.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-two randomised trials were included in the review (N = 695).
<RES> Studies were highly variable in their country of origin, sample size, participant age, intervention delivery type, and outcome measures.
<RES> Risk of bias was variable across categories.
<RES> There was also evidence of some bias in sequence generation and allocation concealment.
<RES> Studies were grouped into four main categories according to intervention target/primary outcome measure.
<RES> Within the first two of these categories, a sub-set of studies were deemed suitable for meta-analysis for a limited number of key outcomes.
<RES> There was very low quality evidence of a positive effect on measures of communication based on individual results from three studies.
<RES> There was low quality evidence from 11 studies reporting mixed results of interventions on measures of social interaction, very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of general communication, and very low quality evidence from four studies reporting mixed results on measures of ToM ability.
<RES> The meta-analysis results we were able to generate showed that interventions targeting emotion recognition across age groups and working with people within the average range of intellectual ability had a positive effect on the target skill, measured by a test using photographs of faces (mean increase of 0.75 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.29 points, Z = 2.75, P < 0.006, four studies, N = 105).
<RES> Therapist-led joint attention interventions can promote production of more joint attention behaviours within adult-child interaction (mean increase of 0.55 points, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99 points, Z = 2.45, P value = 0.01, two studies, N = 88).
<RES> Further analysis undermines this conclusion somewhat by demonstrating that there was no clear evidence that intervention can have an effect on joint attention initiations as measured using a standardised assessment tool (mean increase of 0.23 points, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.94 points, Z = 0.63, P value = 0.53, three studies, N = 92).
<RES> No adverse effects were apparent.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> While there is some evidence that ToM, or a precursor skill, can be taught to people with ASD, there is little evidence of maintenance of that skill, generalisation to other settings, or developmental effects on related skills.
<CON> Furthermore, inconsistency in findings and measurement means that evidence has been graded of 'very low' or 'low' quality and we cannot be confident that suggestions of positive effects will be sustained as high-quality evidence accumulates.
<CON> Further longitudinal designs and larger samples are needed to help elucidate both the efficacy of ToM-linked interventions and the explanatory value of the ToM model itself.
<CON> It is possible that the continuing refinement of the ToM model will lead to better interventions which have a greater impact on development than those investigated to date.

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Cochrane authors considered the evidence for effectiveness and safety of non-surgical treatrments for managing chronic pelvic pain in women.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic pelvic pain in women is a common problem.
<ABS> Specific causes are often difficult to identify, even after investigation with ultrasound and inspection of the pelvis with key hole surgery.
<ABS> Treatment is frequently limited to relief of symptoms obtained with a concoction of medicines.
<ABS> Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about non-surgical interventions for the management of chronic pelvic pain.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Twenty-one randomised controlled studies were identified, of which 13 were included.
<ABS> Eight studies were excluded.
<ABS> The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 women in the control groups.
<ABS> The interventions assessed included medical treatment and psychological, cognitive, behavioural, complementary and physical therapies.
<ABS> The evidence is current to February 2014.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review concludes that evidence shows improvement of pain in women given a high dose of progestogen (50 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) immediately post-treatment and for up to nine months after treatment.
<ABS> However, progestogen was associated with adverse effects such as weight gain and bloating.
<ABS> Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and who received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those whose treatment involved a 'wait and see' policy.
<ABS> Some evidence of benefit was seen with writing disclosure therapy and with distension of painful pelvic structures.
<ABS> No good evidence of benefit was noted with other interventions when compared with standard care or placebo.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was low or moderate for most comparisons, and in most cases evidence was derived from single small studies.
<ABS> Moreover, we were unable to draw meaningful conclusions on quality of life and physical and functional outcomes because of the large variation in outcome measures used by the included studies.
<ABS> Many interventions identified in this review involved only single studies with small sample sizes.
<ABS> Additional studies will be required in the future to replicate results obtained with the use of specific medical interventions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic pelvic pain is a common and debilitating condition; its aetiology is multifactorial, involving social, psychological and biological factors.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness and safety of non-surgical interventions for women with chronic pelvic pain.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register.
<MaM> We also searched (from inception to 5 February 2014) AMED, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS.
<MaM> We handsearched sources such as citation lists, trial registers and conference proceedings.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain were eligible for inclusion.
<MaM> We considered studies of any non-surgical intervention, including lifestyle, physical, medical and psychological treatments.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors.
<MaM> Meta-analysis was performed using the Peto odds ratio (Peto OR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> The primary outcome measure was pain relief, and secondary outcome measures were psychological outcomes, quality of life, requirement for analgesia and adverse effects.
<MaM> The quality of the evidence was assessed by using GRADE methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-one RCTs were identified that involved non-surgical management of chronic pelvic pain: 13 trials were included in the review, and eight were excluded.
<RES> The studies included a total of 750 women—406 women in the intervention groups and 344 in the control groups.
<RES> Included studies had high attrition rates, and investigators often did not blind adequately or did not clearly describe randomisation procedures.
<RES> Medical treatment versus placebo
<RES> Women treated with progestogen reported more adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness) than those given placebo (high-quality evidence).
<RES> The estimated effect of lofexidine on pain outcomes when compared with placebo was compatible with benefit and harm (Peto OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.61, one study, 39 women, low-quality evidence).
<RES> Women in the lofexidine group reported more adverse effects (including drowsiness and dry mouth) than women given placebo (moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Head-to-head comparisons of medical treatments
<RES> Head-to-head comparisons showed that women taking goserelin had greater improvement in pelvic pain score (MD 3, 95% CI 2.08 to 3.92, one study, n = 47, moderate-quality evidence) at one year than those taking progestogen.
<RES> Women taking gabapentin had a lower VAS pain score than those taking amytriptyline (MD -1.50, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.94, n = 40, low-quality evidence).
<RES> Study authors reported that no statistically significant difference was observed in the rate of adverse effects among women taking gabapentin compared with women given amytriptyline.
<RES> The study comparing goserelin versus progestogen did not report on adverse effects.
<RES> Psychological treatment
<RES> Women who underwent reassurance ultrasound scans and received counselling were more likely to report improved pain than those treated with a standard 'wait and see' policy (Peto OR 6.77, 95% CI 2.83 to 16.19, n = 90, low-quality evidence).
<RES> Significantly more women who had writing therapy as a disclosure reported improvement in pain than those in the non-disclosure group (Peto OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.13, n = 48, very low-quality evidence).
<RES> No difference between groups in pain outcomes was noted when other psychological therapies were compared with standard care or placebo (quality of evidence ranged from very low to low).
<RES> Studies did not report on adverse effects.
<RES> Complementary therapy
<RES> Distension of painful pelvic structures was more effective for pain when compared with counselling (MD 35.8, 95% CI 23.08 to 48.52 on a zero to 100 scale, one study, n = 48, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> No difference in pain levels was observed when magnetic therapy was compared with use of a control magnet (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Studies did not report on adverse effects.
<RES> The results of studies examining psychological and complementary therapies could not be combined to yield meaningful results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence of moderate quality supports progestogen as an option for chronic pelvic pain, with efficacy reported during treatment.
<CON> In practice, this option may be most acceptable among women unconcerned about progestogenic adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, bloatedness—the most common adverse effects).
<CON> Although some evidence suggests possible benefit of goserelin when compared with progestogen, gabapentin as compared with amytriptyline, ultrasound versus 'wait and see' and writing therapy versus non-disclosure, the quality of evidence is generally low, and evidence is drawn from single studies.
<CON> Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, RCTs of other medical, lifestyle and psychological interventions are urgently required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Heart transplantation is sometimes possible for people with failing hearts who otherwise would die.
<ABS> Immunosuppressive treatment is necessary after heart transplantation to prevent rejection of the transplanted heart, and has two phases.
<ABS> The first phase is induction treatment, which is given at the time of transplantation, and only for a very short period.
<ABS> The second phase is maintenance treatment, which often starts at the time of the operation, but is given for much longer - often for life.
<ABS> Antibodies are molecules that combat specific targets.
<ABS> Antibodies against T-cells (a type of white blood cell) - known as T-cell antibodies - are used as a form of induction treatment in the first two weeks after heart transplantation.
<ABS> Different types of antibodies are used, but the benefits and harms of each type is unclear.
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effect of T-cell antibodies in people who had had a heart transplant.
<ABS> We hoped to establish whether there is a role for antibodies against T-cells after heart transplantation, and, if so, which antibody preparation works best and causes the least harm.
<ABS> We found 22 studies that included 1427 people who had received a heart-transplant.
<ABS> Most of the trial participants received T-cell antibodies only in the first two weeks after surgery, but treatment for some continued for 10 weeks.
<ABS> All these trials had high risk of bias (that is risk of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).
<ABS> We compared any kind of T-cell antibody induction versus no induction.
<ABS> Furthermore, we compared interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus no induction, monoclonal T-cell antibody versus no induction, interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) induction, interleukin-2 receptor antagonists versus polyclonal antibody induction, and monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) induction versus polyclonal antibody induction.
<ABS> We found no significant differences in incidence of survival, and we found no significant difference in adverse effects (e.g. infection, cytomegalovirus infection, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, cancer, chronic allograft vasculopathy, renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension) for any of the comparisons.
<ABS> The incidence of acute rejection may occur less frequently in patients treated with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction compared with no induction , and in patients treated with polyclonal antibody induction compared with interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction.
<ABS> However, systematic errors and random errors cannot be excluded, and our findings were dependent upon choice of statistical model.
<ABS> Accordingly, our observations are not robust and more trials are needed to confirm or reject these findings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Heart transplantation has become a valuable and well-accepted treatment option for end-stage heart failure.
<INT> Rejection of the transplanted heart by the recipient's body is a risk to the success of the procedure, and life-long immunosuppression is necessary to avoid this.
<INT> Clear evidence is required to identify the best, safest and most effective immunosuppressive treatment strategy for heart transplant recipients.
<INT> To date, there is no consensus on the use of immunosuppressive antibodies against T-cells for induction after heart transplantation.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) assessing immunosuppressive T-cell antibody induction for heart transplant recipients.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors extracted data independently.
<MaM> RevMan analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR), and of continuous data with mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Methodological components were used to assess risks of systematic errors (bias).
<MaM> Trial sequential analysis was used to assess the risks of random errors (play of chance).
<MaM> We assessed mortality, acute rejection, infection, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, cancer, adverse events, chronic allograft vasculopathy, renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidaemia.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> In this review, we included 22 RCTs that investigated the use of T-cell antibody induction, with a total of 1427 heart-transplant recipients.
<RES> All trials were judged to be at a high risk of bias.
<RES> Five trials, with a total of 606 participants, compared any kind of T-cell antibody induction versus no antibody induction; four trials, with a total of 576 participants, compared interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (IL-2 RA) versus no induction; one trial, with 30 participants, compared monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) versus no antibody induction; two trials, with a total of 159 participants, compared IL-2 RA versus monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) induction; four trials, with a total of 185 participants, compared IL-2 RA versus polyclonal antibody induction; seven trials, with a total of 315 participants, compared monoclonal antibody (other than IL-2 RA) versus polyclonal antibody induction; and four trials, with a total of 162 participants, compared polyclonal antibody induction versus another kind, or dose of polyclonal antibodies.
<RES> No significant differences were found for any of the comparisons for the outcomes of mortality, infection, CMV infection, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, cancer, adverse events, chronic allograft vasculopathy, renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidaemia.
<RES> No significant difference was found when the random-effects model was applied (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17; I2 57%).
<RES> In addition, acute rejection occurred more often statistically when IL-2 RA induction was compared with polyclonal antibody induction (24/90 (27%) versus 10/95 (11%); RR 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.86; I2 28%).
<RES> For all of these differences in acute rejection, trial sequential alpha-spending boundaries were not crossed and the required information sizes were not reached when trial sequential analysis was performed, indicating that we cannot exclude random errors.
<RES> We observed some occasional significant differences in adverse events in some of the comparisons, however definitions of adverse events varied between trials, and numbers of participants and events in these outcomes were too small to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review shows that acute rejection might be reduced by IL-2 RA compared with no induction, and by polyclonal antibody induction compared with IL-2 RA, though trial sequential analyses cannot exclude random errors, and the significance of our observations depended on the statistical model used.
<CON> Furthermore, this review does not show other clear benefits or harms associated with the use of any kind of T-cell antibody induction compared with no induction, or when one type of T-cell antibody is compared with another type of antibody.
<CON> The number of trials investigating the use of antibodies against T-cells for induction after heart transplantation is small, and the number of participants and outcomes in these RCTs is limited.
<CON> Furthermore, the included trials are at a high risk of bias.
<CON> Hence, more RCTs are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell antibody induction for heart-transplant recipients.
<CON> Such trials ought to be conducted with low risks of systematic and random error.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this review important?
<ABS> Major depression is a serious illness that can cause significant distress both to sufferers and their families.
<ABS> Major depression affects people's work, relationships and self-esteem.
<ABS> It also affects people physically, changing their sleep patterns, concentration and appetite.
<ABS> This review is important because it compares a new antidepressant, called agomelatine, with some other antidepressants used to treat major depression.
<ABS> Agomelatine works in a different way to existing antidepressants, it affects the hormone melatonin in the brain, and stimulates release of the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine.
<ABS> Who may be interested in this review?
<ABS> People affected by major depression.
<ABS> General Practitioners (GPs), psychiatrists and pharmacists.
<ABS> Professionals working in adult mental health services.
<ABS> Families and friends of people who suffer from major depression.
<ABS> What questions does this review aim to answer?
<ABS> Does agomelatine work better than other antidepressant medications?
<ABS> Do patients tolerate agomelatine better than other antidepressants?
<ABS> How do the side-effects of agomelatine compare with other antidepressants?
<ABS> Which studies were included in the review?
<ABS> In July 2013, we used electronic medical databases to find all published and unpublished medical trials that compared agomelatine with any other antidepressant.
<ABS> We identified 13 medical trials, involving a total of 4495 participants, that could be included in the review.
<ABS> The reviewers rated the overall quality of the trials as 'moderate'.
<ABS> Almost all of the trials included were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that developed agomelatine (Servier), which could introduce bias (research shows that funding strongly affects the outcomes of research studies).
<ABS> What does the evidence from the review tell us?
<ABS> The review included trials comparing agomelatine with a group of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and one antidepressant from the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor group, called venlafaxine.
<ABS> Participants in the studies were followed up for between six to 12 weeks.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was no more or less effective in reducing symptoms of depression than any of the other antidepressants.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was no more or less effective in preventing relapse of depression than any of the other antidepressants.
<ABS> - Agomelatine was tolerated better than venlafaxine (fewer people discontinued treatment), but the same as the SSRIs.
<ABS> - Agomelatine caused a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine.
<ABS> - Agomelatine caused a lower rate of vomiting, nausea and sexual side-effects than SSRIs.
<ABS> What should happen next?
<ABS> The reviewers conclude that agomelatine is not more effective than other antidepressants currently on the market.
<ABS> No firm conclusion on agomelatine can be made because of problems with reporting of data in the trials included.
<ABS> The authors recommend that further trials of agomelatine versus placebo (dummy pill), particularly in primary care settings (where the majority of patient/practitioner contact take place, e.g. GP surgeries), should be carried out to improve the quality of evidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, is a syndrome characterised by a number of behavioural, cognitive and emotional features.
<INT> There is a need for more effective and better tolerated antidepressants to combat this condition.
<INT> Agomelatine was recently added to the list of available antidepressant drugs; it is a novel antidepressant that works on melatonergic (MT1 and MT2), 5-HT 2B and 5-HT2C receptors.
<INT> Because the mechanism of action is claimed to be novel, it may provide a useful, alternative pharmacological strategy to existing antidepressant drugs.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Collaboration's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 31 July 2013.
<MaM> The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 onwards), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and PsycINFO (1967 onwards).
<MaM> We checked reference lists of relevant studies together with reviews and regulatory agency reports.
<MaM> No restrictions on date, language or publication status were applied to the search.
<MaM> Servier Laboratories (developers of agomelatine) and other experts in the field were contacted for supplemental data.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 13 studies (4495 participants) were included in this review.
<RES> Agomelatine was compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), namely paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and to the serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine.
<RES> Participants were followed up for six to 12 weeks.
<RES> Agomelatine did not show any advantage or disadvantage over the other antidepressants for our primary outcome, response to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08, P value 0.75 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, P value 0.16 compared to venlafaxine).
<RES> Also, agomelatine showed no advantage or disadvantage over other antidepressants for remission (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01, P value 0.07 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value 0.73 compared to venlafaxine).
<RES> Overall, agomelatine appeared to be better tolerated than venlafaxine in terms of lower rates of drop outs (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67, P value 0.0005), and showed the same level of tolerability as SSRIs (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, P value 0.44).
<RES> Agomelatine induced a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64, P value 0.007).
<RES> With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies.
<RES> There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies.
<RES> The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings.
<RES> With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise.
<RES> Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial.
<RES> Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias.
<RES> The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good.
<RES> Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished.
<RES> Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Agomelatine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression.
<CON> We found evidence that compared agomelatine with only a small number of other active antidepressive agents, and there were only a few trials for each comparison, which limits the generalisability of the results.

<H1> Analgesia for forceps delivery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Analgesia for forceps delivery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Forceps are instruments designed to aid in the delivery of the baby by gripping the head.
<ABS> Many different types of forceps have been developed.
<ABS> Forceps may be used when the baby fails to progress to delivery or to help to shorten labour for the mother when there is a need, for example when the mother is exhausted in the second stage of labour, if there is suspected distress of the fetus, or when the mother has a medical condition such as a cardiac, respiratory or neurologic condition that may prevent her from pushing.
<ABS> A woman who requires forceps to be used to assist her baby's birth needs effective pain relief (analgesia) so that she can remain comfortable to help the doctor perform the procedure safely.
<ABS> This review found that there is not enough evidence from the four included randomised controlled trials, involving 388 women and their babies, to determine the most effective and safe analgesic agent or technique for women who are undergoing a forceps delivery.
<ABS> Three of the four trials compared diazepam with alternative agents (ketamine, vinydan-ether, or "other" anaesthesic agent) to provide general anaesthesia during forceps delivery.
<ABS> A number of different methods were used to measure pain relief and the results could not be combined.
<ABS> The data from one trial could not be included in the review.
<ABS> Women who received diazepam were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women who received vinydan-ether in one small trial.
<ABS> In another small trial, however, no difference in pain relief was shown when diazepam was compared with ketamine.
<ABS> In the trial that compared spinal analgesia with pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were more likely to report their pain relief as adequate and were less likely to report severe pain.
<ABS> None of the four trials reported on serious complications or death for the mother or baby.
<ABS> The included trials had a high or unclear risk of bias and were not of a high quality.
<ABS> Each of the four included trials was conducted prior to 1980 and assessed agents or methods that are not commonly used in clinical practice today.
<ABS> Therefore, more studies are needed to establish what drug, or technique, is most effective and safe in reducing pain for the mother.
<ABS> These studies should also assess safety for the baby.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A forceps delivery may be indicated when a fetus fails to progress to delivery, or when delivery needs to be expedited in the second stage of labour.
<INT> It is currently unclear what the most effective and safe agent or method is to provide pain relief during forceps delivery.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four trials involving 388 women that were judged to be at an unclear to high risk of bias overall.
<RES> A variety of different agents for providing analgesia were assessed in the trials, and a number of different methods to measure pain relief were used, and thus results could not be combined in meta-analysis.
<RES> Three trials compared diazepam with an alternative agent (ketamine; vinydan-ether; "other" anaesthesic agent) for the provision of general anaesthesia, and one trial compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block (in both groups lignocaine was administered).
<RES> With regard to the primary outcomes, women receiving diazepam for forceps delivery in one small trial were more likely to judge their pain relief as effective compared with women receiving vinydan-ether (risk ratio (RR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.25; 101 women).
<RES> In a further small trial, no significant difference was seen in the number of women judging their pain relief as effective when diazepam was compared with ketamine (RR 1.42; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.07; 26 women).
<RES> In the trial that compared spinal analgesia to pudendal nerve block, women receiving spinal analgesia were significantly more likely to regard their analgesia as adequate (RR 3.36; 95% CI 2.46 to 4.60; 183 women) and were less likely to report severe pain during forceps delivery (RR 0.02; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.27; 183 women).
<RES> No trials reported on the review's other two primary outcomes of serious maternal adverse effects or complications, and neonatal mortality or serious morbidity.
<RES> In terms of secondary outcomes, women receiving diazepam compared with vinydan-ether, were significantly less likely to experience vomiting (RR 0.04; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.62; 101 women).
<RES> No significant differences were seen for the few neonatal outcomes that were reported across any of the comparisons (including Agpar score of less than seven at five minutes and acidosis as defined by cord blood arterial pH less than 7.2).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Neonatal outcomes have largely not been evaluated.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People who receive transplanted lungs are at significant risk of organ rejection.
<ABS> To help reduce the risk of organ rejection, antibodies against T-cells (a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in immunity) are given to patients within the first two weeks after transplantation.
<ABS> Several types of antibodies have been used, but their benefits and harms are unclear.
<ABS> We evaluated the use of antibodies against T-cells following lung transplantation to find out whether this therapy was safe, beneficial or harmful, and which type of antibodies work best with fewest adverse effects.
<ABS> We analysed six studies that investigated the use of several different types of antibody therapies in 278 adult patients following lung transplantation.
<ABS> Flaws in study designs were found that indicated the studies were at risk of overestimating benefits and underestimating harms.
<ABS> Our analysis compared several types of antibodies, but with one exception - that antithymocyte globulin seemed to increase some adverse events - we found no significant differences in lung survival or rejection for any of the treatments.
<ABS> There was some uncertainty about this effect because the study was too small to be sure that observed benefits would apply to a larger population.
<ABS> We found no significant differences among therapies in terms of infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer.
<ABS> Few investigated the use of T-cell antibodies after lung transplantation, and these included small numbers of participants.
<ABS> These limitations meant that our findings did not necessarily indicate no differences existed among comparisons in our analysis.
<ABS> To overcome this problem, larger and more robust randomised studies that assess the benefits and harms of antibodies against T-cells for people following lung transplantation are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Lung transplantation has become a valuable and well-accepted treatment option for most end-stage lung diseases.
<INT> Lung transplant recipients are at risk of transplanted organ rejection, and life-long immunosuppression is necessary.
<INT> Clear evidence is essential to identify an optimal, safe and effective immunosuppressive treatment strategy for lung transplant recipients.
<INT> Consensus has not yet been achieved concerning use of immunosuppressive antibodies against T-cells for induction following lung transplantation.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immunosuppressive monoclonal and polyclonal T-cell antibody induction for lung transplant recipients.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three authors extracted data.
<MaM> We derived risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Methodological risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and trial sequential analyses were undertaken to assess the risk of random errors (play of chance).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We conducted comparisons of polyclonal or monoclonal T-cell antibody induction versus no induction (3 studies, 140 participants); polyclonal T-cell antibody versus no induction (3 studies, 125 participants); interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL-2RA) versus no induction (1 study, 25 participants); polyclonal T-cell antibody versus muromonab-CD3 (1 study, 64 participants); and polyclonal T-cell antibody versus IL-2RA (3 studies, 100 participants).
<RES> Overall we found no significant differences among interventions in terms of mortality, acute rejection, adverse effects, infection, pneumonia, cytomegalovirus infection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, or cancer.
<RES> We found a significant outcome difference in one study that compared antithymocyte globulin versus muromonab-CD3 relating to adverse events (25/34 (74%) versus 12/30 (40%); RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.98).
<RES> This suggested that antithymocyte globulin increased occurrence of adverse events.
<RES> However, trial sequential analysis found that the required information size had not been reached, and the cumulative Z-curve did not cross the trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries.
<RES> None of the studies reported quality of life or kidney injury.
<RES> Trial sequential analyses indicated that none of the meta-analyses achieved required information sizes and the cumulative Z-curves did not cross the trial sequential alpha-spending monitoring boundaries, nor reached the area of futility.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No clear benefits or harms associated with the use of T-cell antibody induction compared with no induction, or when different types of T-cell antibodies were compared were identified in this review.
<CON> Few studies were identified that investigated use of antibodies against T-cells for induction after lung transplantation, and numbers of participants and outcomes were also limited.
<CON> Assessment of the included studies found that all were at high risk of methodological bias.
<CON> Further RCTs are needed to perform robust assessment of the benefits and harms of T-cell antibody induction for lung transplant recipients.
<CON> Future studies should be designed and conducted according to methodologies to reduce risks of systematic error (bias) and random error (play of chance).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Over the past few decades, great improvements in diagnostics and treatment have resulted in a major increase in survival rates of childhood cancer.
<ABS> However, childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at great risk of developing adverse effects as a result of their cancer treatment.
<ABS> One of the potential adverse effects of childhood cancer treatment is kidney damage.
<ABS> Renal adverse effects are common during and just after treatment, but very little evidence is available on the frequency of renal function impairment in long-term CCS and on what the risk factors are.
<ABS> Survivors with impaired renal function due to childhood cancer treatment are usually symptom free.
<ABS> The kidneys are remarkably well able to compensate for problems in their functioning.
<ABS> However, when renal late adverse events become symptomatic, survivors can experience a range of symptoms, depending on the kidney functions that are damaged.
<ABS> This systematic review aimed to assess the magnitude of asymptomatic and symptomatic early and late renal adverse events in long-term CCS and to identify which risk factors contribute to impaired renal function.
<ABS> After thoroughly searching the literature, we were able to include 57 studies in this review.
<ABS> These 57 studies included at least 13,338 participants of interest for this study, of whom at least 6516 underwent renal function testing.
<ABS> Wide variation was noted in the percentage of participants who suffered from renal impairment after treatment for childhood cancer, ranging from 0% to 84%.
<ABS> Variation in the study population, received treatments, outcome measurements and study quality may explain the variation in reported percentages.
<ABS> All included studies suffered from methodological issues.
<ABS> More and especially higher quality research is needed to gain better insight into renal adverse events and related risk factors.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Great improvements in diagnostics and treatment for malignant disease in childhood have led to a major increase in survival.
<INT> However, childhood cancer survivors (CCS) are at great risk for developing adverse effects caused by multimodal treatment for their malignancy.
<INT> Nephrotoxicity is one of these known (acute) side effects of several treatments, including cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiotherapy and nephrectomy, and can cause glomerular filtration rate impairment, proteinuria, tubulopathy and hypertension.
<INT> However, evidence about the long-term effects of these treatments on renal function remains inconclusive.
<INT> To reduce the number of (long-term) nephrotoxic events in CCS, it is important to know the risk of, and risk factors for, early and late renal adverse effects, so that ultimately treatment and screening protocols can be adjusted.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction using standardised data collection forms.
<MaM> Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified 5504 studies, of which 5138 were excluded on the basis of title and/or abstract.
<RES> The full-text screening of the remaining 366 articles resulted in the inclusion of 57 studies investigating the prevalence of and sometimes also risk factors for early and late renal adverse effects of treatment for childhood cancer.
<RES> The 57 studies included at least 13,338 participants of interest for this study, of whom at least 6516 underwent renal function testing.
<RES> The prevalence of renal adverse effects ranged from 0% to 84%.
<RES> This variation may be due to diversity in included malignancies, prescribed treatments, reported outcome measurements and the methodological quality of available evidence.
<RES> Chronic kidney disease/renal insufficiency (as defined by the authors of the original studies) was reported in 10 of 57 studies.
<RES> The prevalence of chronic kidney disease ranged between 0.5% and 70.4% in the 10 studies and between 0.5% and 18.8% in the six studies that specifically investigated Wilms' tumour survivors treated with a unilateral nephrectomy.
<RES> A decreased (estimated) glomerular filtration rate was present in 0% to 50% of all assessed survivors (32/57 studies).
<RES> Total body irradiation; concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin B or cyclosporin A; older age at treatment and longer interval from therapy to follow-up were significant risk factors reported in multivariate analyses.
<RES> Proteinuria was present in 0% to 84% of all survivors (17/57 studies).
<RES> No study performed multivariate analysis to assess risk factors for proteinuria.
<RES> Hypophosphataemia was assessed in seven studies.
<RES> Reported prevalences ranged between 0% and 47.6%, but four of seven studies found a prevalence of 0%.
<RES> No studies assessed risk factors for hypophosphataemia using multivariate analysis.
<RES> The prevalence of impairment of tubular phosphate reabsorption was mostly higher (range 0% to 62.5%; 11/57 studies).
<RES> Higher cumulative ifosfamide dose, concomitant cisplatin treatment, nephrectomy and longer follow-up duration were significant risk factors for impaired tubular phosphate reabsorption in multivariate analyses.
<RES> Treatment with cisplatin and carboplatin was associated with a significantly lower serum magnesium level in multivariate analysis, and the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia ranged between 0% and 37.5% in the eight studies investigating serum magnesium.
<RES> Hypertension was investigated in 24 of the 57 studies.
<RES> Reported prevalences ranged from 0% to 18.2%.
<RES> A higher body mass index was the only significant risk factor noted in more than one multivariate analysis.
<RES> Other reported factors that significantly increased the risk of hypertension were use of total body irradiation, abdominal irradiation, acute kidney injury, unrelated or autologous stem cell donor type, growth hormone therapy and older age at screening.
<RES> Previous infection with hepatitis C significantly decreased the risk of hypertension.
<RES> Because of the profound heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform any meta-analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The prevalence of renal adverse events after treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, ifosfamide, radiation therapy involving the kidney region and/or nephrectomy ranged from 0% to 84%.
<CON> With currently available evidence, it was not possible to draw any conclusions with regard to prevalence of and risk factors for renal adverse effects.
<CON> Future studies should focus on adequate study design and reporting and should deploy multivariate risk factor analysis to correct for possible confounding.
<CON> Until more evidence becomes available, CCS should be enrolled into long-term follow-up programmes to monitor their renal function and blood pressure.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Health and education are strongly connected: healthy children achieve better results at school, which in turn are associated with improved health later in life.
<ABS> This relationship between health and education forms the basis of the World Health Organization's (WHO’s) Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework, an approach to promoting health in schools that addresses the whole school environment.
<ABS> Although the HPS framework is used in many schools, we currently do not know if it is effective.
<ABS> This review aimed to assess whether the HPS framework can improve students’ health and well-being and their performance at school.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched 20 health, education, and social science databases, as well as trials registries and relevant websites, for cluster-randomised controlled trials of school-based interventions aiming to improve the health of young people aged four to 18 years.
<ABS> We only included trials of programmes that addressed all three points in the HPS framework: including health education in the curriculum; changing the school’s social or physical environment, or both; and involving students’ families or the local community, or both.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 67 trials, comprising 1345 schools and 98 districts, that fulfilled our criteria.
<ABS> These focused on a wide range of health topics, including physical activity, nutrition, substance use (tobacco, alcohol, and drugs), bullying, violence, mental health, sexual health, hand-washing, cycle-helmet use, sun protection, eating disorders, and oral health.
<ABS> For each study, two review authors independently extracted relevant data and assessed the risk of the study being biased.
<ABS> We grouped together studies according to the health topic(s) they focused on.
<ABS> We found that interventions using the HPS approach were able to reduce students’ body mass index (BMI), increase physical activity and fitness levels, improve fruit and vegetable consumption, decrease cigarette use, and reduce reports of being bullied.
<ABS> However, we found little evidence of an effect on BMI when age and gender were taken into account (zBMI), and no evidence of effectiveness on fat intake, alcohol and drug use, mental health, violence, and bullying others.
<ABS> We did not have enough data to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the HPS approach for sexual health, hand-washing, cycle-helmet use, eating disorders, sun protection, oral health or academic outcomes.
<ABS> Few studies discussed whether the health promotion activities, or the collection of data relating to these, could have caused any harm to the students involved.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall, the quality of evidence was low to moderate.
<ABS> We identified some problems with the way studies were conducted, which may have introduced bias, including many studies relying on students’ accounts of their own behaviours (rather than these being measured objectively) and high numbers of students dropping out of studies.
<ABS> These problems, and the small number of studies included in our analysis, limit our ability to draw clear conclusions about the effectiveness of the HPS framework in general.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Overall, we found some evidence to suggest the HPS approach can produce improvements in certain areas of health, but there are not enough data to draw conclusions about its effectiveness for others.
<ABS> We need more studies to find out if this approach can improve other aspects of health and how students perform at school.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The effectiveness of this approach has not been previously rigorously reviewed.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched relevant websites, handsearched reference lists, and used citation tracking to identify other relevant articles.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included cluster-randomised controlled trials where randomisation took place at the level of school, district or other geographical area.
<MaM> Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years, attending schools or colleges.
<MaM> In this review, we define HPS interventions as comprising the following three elements: input to the curriculum; changes to the school’s ethos or environment or both; and engagement with families or communities, or both.
<MaM> We compared this intervention against schools that implemented either no intervention or continued with their usual practice, or any programme that included just one or two of the above mentioned HPS elements.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors identified relevant trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in the trials.
<MaM> We grouped different types of interventions according to the health topic targeted or the approach used, or both.
<MaM> Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses to provide a summary of results across studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 67 eligible cluster trials, randomising 1443 schools or districts.
<RES> This is made up of 1345 schools and 98 districts.
<RES> The studies tackled a range of health issues: physical activity (4), nutrition (12), physical activity and nutrition combined (18), bullying (7), tobacco (5), alcohol (2), sexual health (2), violence (2), mental health (2), hand-washing (2), multiple risk behaviours (7), cycle-helmet use (1), eating disorders (1), sun protection (1), and oral health (1).
<RES> The quality of evidence overall was low to moderate as determined by the GRADE approach.
<RES> 'Risk of bias' assessments identified methodological limitations, including heavy reliance on self-reported data and high attrition rates for some studies.
<RES> In addition, there was a lack of long-term follow-up data for most studies.
<RES> We found positive effects for some interventions for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied.
<RES> Intervention effects were generally small but have the potential to produce public health benefits at the population level.
<RES> We found little evidence of effectiveness for standardised body mass index (zBMI) and no evidence of effectiveness for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others; however, only a small number of studies focused on these latter outcomes.
<RES> It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data.
<RES> Few studies provided details on adverse events or outcomes related to the interventions.
<RES> In addition, few studies included any academic, attendance or school-related outcomes.
<RES> We therefore cannot draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of this approach for improving academic achievement.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The results of this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of some interventions based on the HPS framework for improving certain health outcomes but not others.
<CON> More well-designed research is required to establish the effectiveness of this approach for other health topics and academic achievement.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Self-management education programmes for osteoarthritis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Self-management education programmes for osteoarthritis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review shows that in people with osteoarthritis:
<ABS> Self-management education programmes may not improve self-management skills, osteoarthritis symptoms, function, quality of life and dropout rates but may reduce pain modestly compared with attention control.
<ABS> Active and positive engagement in life was not reported.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes may slightly improve self-management skills, pain and function but may not improve active and positive engagement in life, osteoarthritis symptoms, quality of life and dropout rates compared with usual care.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes probably do not improve outcomes compared with provision of information alone or compared with other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture).
<ABS> What is osteoarthritis and what are self-management education programmes?
<ABS> Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the joints, such as your knee or hip, or the joints in your hands.
<ABS> The joint cartilage that lines the joint gradually thins, narrowing the joint space.
<ABS> In severe cases, no cartilage remains between the bones, and the bones rub together when the joint is moved, making the joint painful and sometimes unstable.
<ABS> Self-management education programmes are behavioural interventions designed to encourage people with chronic disease to take an active role in the management of their own condition.
<ABS> These programmes aim to improve outcomes for patients by supporting, not replacing, medical care.
<ABS> The content used to educate patients about their condition and to explain how they can best manage their symptoms varies between programmes.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with osteoarthritis who undergo self-management programmes:
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their self-management skills to be 0.4 points better (0.4 points worse to 1.2 points better) on a scale of 1 to 10 (higher score means better self-management) after 12 months (4% absolute improvement; 4% worse to 12% better).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their self-management skills as 6.2 points on a scale of 1 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their self-management skills as 5.8 points on a scale of 1 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their pain to be 0.8 points lower (0.3 to 0.14 points lower) on a scale of 0 to 10 (lower score means less pain) after 12 months (8% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their pain as 5 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their pain as 5.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their osteoarthritis symptoms to be 0.14 points lower (0.54 points lower to 0.26 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 10 (lower score means fewer symptoms) after 12 months (1% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their symptoms as 4.1 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their symptoms as 4.2 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their function to be 0.04 points lower (0.02 points lower to 0.10 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 3 (lower score means better function) after 12 months (4% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their function as 1.25 points on a scale of 0 to 3.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their function as 1.29 points on a scale of 0 to 3.
<ABS> People who completed a self-management programme rated their quality of life to be 0.01 points lower (0.03 points lower to 0.01 points higher) on a scale of 0 to 1 (higher score means better quality of life) after 12 months (1% absolute worsening).
<ABS> - People who completed a self-management programme rated their quality of life as 0.56 points on a scale of 0 to 1.
<ABS> - People who received attention control rated their quality of life as 0.57 points on a scale of 0 to 1.
<ABS> One more person out of 100 dropped out of self-management programmes (1% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 13 out of 100 people who received a self-management programme dropped out.
<ABS> - 12 out of 100 people who received attention control dropped out.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of self-management education programmes for people with osteoarthritis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscINFO, SCOPUS and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trial Registry Platform were searched, without language restriction, on 17 January 2013.
<MaM> We checked references of reviews and included trials to identify additional studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of self-management education programmes in people with osteoarthritis were included.
<MaM> Studies with participants receiving passive recipients of care and studies comparing one type of programme versus another were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> In addition to standard methods we extracted components of the self-management interventions using the eight domains of the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ), and contextual and participant characteristics using PROGRESS-Plus and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ).
<MaM> We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for these outcomes using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Although heterogeneous, most interventions included elements of skill and technique acquisition (94%), health-directed activity (85%) and self-monitoring and insight (79%); social integration and support were addressed in only 12%.
<RES> Most studies did not provide enough information to assess all PROGRESS-Plus items.
<RES> Eight studies included predominantly Caucasian, educated female participants, and only four provided any information on participants' health literacy.
<RES> All studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias for self-reported outcomes; 20 studies were at high risk of selection bias, 16 were at high risk of attrition bias, two were at high risk of reporting bias and 12 were at risk of other biases.
<RES> We deemed attention control as the most appropriate and thus the main comparator.
<RES> Compared with attention control, self-management programmes may not result in significant benefits at 12 months.
<RES> Low-quality evidence from one study (344 people) indicates that self-management skills were similar in active and control groups: 5.8 points on a 10-point self-efficacy scale in the control group, and the mean difference (MD) between groups was 0.4 points (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to 1.19).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from four studies (575 people) indicates that self-management programmes may lead to a small but clinically unimportant reduction in pain: the standardised mean difference (SMD) between groups was -0.26 (95% CI -0.44 to -0.09); pain was 6 points on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) in the control group, treatment resulted in a mean reduction of 0.8 points (95% CI -0.14 to -0.3) on a 10-point scale, with number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 8 (95% CI 5 to 23).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from one study (251 people) indicates that the mean global osteoarthritis score was 4.2 on a 0 to 10-point symptom scale (lower better) in the control group, and treatment reduced symptoms by a mean of 0.14 points (95% CI -0.54 to 0.26).
<RES> This result does not exclude the possibility of a clinically important benefit in some people (0.5 point reduction included in 95% CI).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from three studies (574 people) showed no signficant difference in function between groups (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.5 to 0.11); mean function was 1.29 points on a 0 to 3-point scale in the control group, and treatment resulted in a mean improvement of 0.04 points with self-management (95% CI -0.10 to 0.02).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from one study (165 people) showed no between-group difference in quality of life (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01) from a control group mean of 0.57 units on 0 to 1 well-being scale.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence from five studies (937 people) shows similar withdrawal rates between self-management (13%) and control groups (12%): RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.57).
<RES> Positive and active engagement in life was not measured.
<RES> Compared with usual care, moderate-quality evidence from 11 studies (up to 1,706 participants) indicates that self-management programmes probably provide small benefits up to 21 months, in terms of self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms and function, although these are of doubtful clinical importance, and no improvement in positive and active engagement in life or quality of life.
<RES> Withdrawal rates were similar.
<RES> Low to moderate quality evidence indicates no important differences in self-management , pain, symptoms, function, quality of life or withdrawal rates between self-management programmes and information alone or other interventions (exercise, physiotherapy, social support or acupuncture).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Low to moderate quality evidence indicates that self-management education programmes result in no or small benefits in people with osteoarthritis but are unlikely to cause harm.
<CON> Compared with attention control, these programmes probably do not improve self-management skills, pain, osteoarthritis symptoms, function or quality of life, and have unknown effects on positive and active engagement in life.
<CON> Compared with usual care, they may slightly improve self-management skills, pain, function and symptoms, although these benefits are of unlikely clinical importance.
<CON> Further studies investigating the effects of self-management education programmes, as delivered in the trials in this review, are unlikely to change our conclusions substantially, as confounding from biases across studies would have likely favoured self-management.
<CON> However, trials assessing other models of self-management education programme delivery may be warranted.
<CON> These should adequately describe the intervention they deliver and consider the expanded PROGRESS-Plus framework and health literacy, to explore issues of health equity for recipients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Adolescents worldwide are known to use both legal and illegal substances to different degrees, which can lead to other problems.
<ABS> Brief interventions are short programmes that aim to help reduce or stop substance use, in this case among adolescents.
<ABS> We conducted a Cochrane systematic review to look at the effectiveness of school-based brief interventions for substance use and substance-related problem behaviours among adolescents.
<ABS> The studies compared brief intervention programmes with two major kinds of comparison or control groups, 1) an information provision group and 2) an assessment-only group where participants received no intervention.
<ABS> Results of the review were mixed as we found studies that showed that brief intervention had no effects on substance use as well as studies where the brief intervention significantly reduced substance use and other problem behaviours.
<ABS> The pattern of results indicated that participants who received a brief intervention generally did better in reducing their substance use than participants who received no intervention at all.
<ABS> However, participants who received a brief intervention did no better in reducing their substance use than participants who received information only interventions.
<ABS> Across these intervention programmes, the evidence of benefit we found for a general reduction in substance use (especially cannabis, and less so for alcohol) was of limited quality.
<ABS> In view of the risk of bias, variation in study findings and imprecision, we are unable to make definitive statements about the effectiveness of these interventions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Adolescent substance use is a major problem, in and of itself and because it acts as a risk factor for other problem behaviours.
<INT> As substance use during adolescence can lead to adverse and often long-term health and social consequences, it is important to intervene early on in order to prevent progression to more severe problems.
<INT> Such interventions can be conducted in school settings.
<INT> This review set out to evaluate the effectiveness of brief school-based interventions for adolescent substance use.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched 10 electronic databases and six websites on evidence-based interventions, and the reference lists of included studies and reviews, from 1966 to March 2013.
<MaM> We also contacted authors and organisations to identify any additional studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials that evaluated the effects of brief school-based interventions for substance-using adolescents.
<MaM> The primary outcomes were reduction or cessation of substance use.
<MaM> The secondary outcomes were engagement in criminal activity and engagement in delinquent or problem behaviours related to substance use.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies involving 1139 participants were included in this review.
<RES> Overall the quality of evidence was moderate in the information provision comparison, and low or very low in the assessment only comparison.
<RES> Reasons for downgrading the quality included risk of bias of the included studies, imprecision and inconsistency.
<RES> Our findings suggested that compared to information provision only, brief interventions (BIs) did not have a significant effect on any substance use (three studies, 732 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to 0.09) or delinquent-type behaviour outcomes among adolescents (two studies, 531 participants, SMD -0.26; 95% CI -0.54 to 0.02).
<RES> When compared to assessment-only controls, BIs had some significant effects on substance use and delinquent-type or problem behaviours, but high levels of heterogeneity existed between studies and it was not always possible to pool the results.
<RES> When the comparison was with assessment-only conditions, studies of individual interventions that measured BI effectiveness reported significantly reduced substance use in general and in two studies reduced frequency of alcohol use specifically.
<RES> When the data were pooled, BIs reduced cannabis frequency (SMD -0.22; 95% CI -0.45 to -0.02) across three studies (n = 407).
<RES> Cannabis quantity was also reduced by BIs in comparison to assessment only (SMD -60.27; 95% CI -66.59 to -53.95) in one study (n = 179).
<RES> However, the evidence for studies that compared brief interventions to assessment-only conditions was generally of low quality.
<RES> Brief interventions also had mixed effects on participants' delinquent or problem behaviours.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was limited quality evidence that brief school-based interventions were more effective in reducing substance use than the assessment-only condition, but were similar to information provision.
<CON> There is some evidence for the effectiveness of BI in reducing adolescent substance use, particularly cannabis, when compared to assessment only.
<CON> However, it is premature to make definitive statements about the effectiveness of brief school-based interventions for reducing adolescent substance use.
<CON> Further high quality studies examining the relative effectiveness of BIs for substance use and other problem behaviours need to be conducted, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> It is estimated that 350,000 women per year in the United Kingdom and millions more worldwide experience perineal stitches because of a childbirth-related natural tear or cut (episiotomy).
<ABS> Sometimes the perineal wound breaks down (opens up).
<ABS> The current management of broken down wounds varies widely between individual health practitioners and hospitals.
<ABS> The alternative is re-stitching.
<ABS> Due to the lack of research evidence, we do not know the best way to treat this type of complication.
<ABS> This review looked at randomised controlled trials of re-stitching broken down wounds compared with non-stitching.
<ABS> Two small studies were identified.
<ABS> One study, involving 17 women, showed a marginal tendency to improved healing in the women who were re-stitched, however, this evidence was not conclusive.
<ABS> In the other study involving 35 women, more women had resumed intercourse in the re-suturing group at two months.
<ABS> As the studies were small and of poor quality, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the best way to manage wound breakdown after childbirth.
<ABS> Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct further studies to compare fully the benefits and risks of both treatments.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The postpartum management of perineal trauma is a core component of routine maternity care.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two small studies of poor methodological quality including 52 women with a dehisced and/or infected episiotomy wound at point of entry have been included.
<RES> Only one small study presented data in relation to wound healing at less than four weeks, (the primary outcome measure for this review), although no reference was made to demonstrate how healing was measured.
<RES> There was a trend to favour this outcome in the resuturing group, however, this difference was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 3.88, one study, 17 women).
<RES> Similarly, only one trial reported on rates of dyspareunia (a secondary outcome measure for this review) at two months and six months with no statistically significant difference between both groups; two months, (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.11, one study, 26 women) and six months, (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.87, one study 32 women).
<RES> This trial also included data on the numbers of women who resumed sexual intercourse by two months and six months.
<RES> Significantly more women in the secondary suturing group had resumed intercourse by two months (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.89, one study, 35 women), although by six months there was no significant difference between the two groups (RR 1.08, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.28).
<RES> Neither of the trials included data in relation to the following prespecified secondary outcome measures: pain at any time interval; the woman's satisfaction with the aesthetic results of the perineal wound; exclusive breastfeeding; maternal anxiety or depression.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is an urgent need for a robust randomised controlled trial to evaluate fully the comparative effects of both treatment options.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Influenza vaccines in immunosuppressed adults with cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Adults with cancer are prone to serious complications from influenza, more than healthy adults.
<ABS> The influenza vaccine protects against influenza and its complications.
<ABS> However, its effectiveness among cancer patients is unclear, as the immune dysfunction that accompanies cancer and as a result of chemotherapy might lower immune response to the vaccine.
<ABS> Cancer patients, therefore, do not have clear information on the importance, need and safety of the vaccine.
<ABS> This review focused on the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in adults with cancer who have a suppressed immune system because of the cancer or chemotherapy.
<ABS> We identified four clinical studies addressing this question, only one of which was a randomized controlled trial, where patients were randomly selected to get or not to get the vaccine.
<ABS> Two studies showed that adults with cancer who were vaccinated were found to have lower rates of death, but these studies were not randomized.
<ABS> Pooling (combining) results from the different studies was not possible because of different methods or different way of reporting results.
<ABS> There was a significantly lower rate of influenza-like illness (any febrile respiratory illness), pneumonia, confirmed influenza and hospitalization, for any reason, among vaccine recipients in at least one study for each outcome.
<ABS> No side-effects to the vaccine were reported in these studies.
<ABS> The strength of evidence is limited by the low number of studies and by their low methodological quality (high risk of bias).
<ABS> Influenza vaccines given to adults with cancer contain an inactivated virus that cannot cause influenza or other viral infection.
<ABS> The possibility for benefit shown in this review supports yearly influenza vaccination in adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Immunosuppressed cancer patients are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications.
<INT> Guidelines, therefore, recommend influenza vaccination for these patients.
<INT> However, data on vaccine effectiveness in this population is lacking, and the value of vaccination in this population remains unclear.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in immunosuppressed adults with malignancies.
<OBJ> The primary review outcome is all-cause mortality, preferably at the end of the influenza season.
<OBJ> Influenza-like illness (ILI, a clinical definition), confirmed influenza, pneumonia, any hospitalization and influenza-related mortality were defined as secondary outcomes.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS databases up to August 2013.
<MaM> We searched the following conference proceedings: ICAAC, ECCMID, IDSA (infectious disease conferences), ASH, ASBMT, EBMT (hematological), and ASCO (oncological) between the years 2006 to 2010.
<MaM> In addition, we scanned the references of all identified studies and pertinent reviews.
<MaM> We searched the websites of the manufacturers of influenza vaccine.
<MaM> Finally, we searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registry databases using the website.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included studies adhering to Cochrane methodology.
<MaM> Meta-analysis could not be performed because of different outcome and denominator definitions in the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified four studies: one RCT and three observational studies, including 2124 participants.
<RES> One study reported results in person-years while the other three reported per person.
<RES> The studies were performed between 1993 and 2012 and included adults with haematological diseases (two studies), patients following bone marrow transplantation (one study) and solid malignancies (three studies).
<RES> Only two observational studies reported all-cause mortality; one showing an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.99) for death with vaccination and the other reporting an odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.71).
<RES> The RCT reported a statistically significant reduction in ILI with vaccination, while no difference was observed in one observational study.
<RES> Confirmed influenza rates were lower with vaccination in the three observational studies, the difference reaching statistical significance in one.
<RES> Pneumonia was observed significantly less frequently with vaccination in one observational study, but no difference was detected in another or in the RCT.
<RES> The RCT showed a reduction in hospitalizations following vaccination, while an observational study found no difference.
<RES> No life-threatening or persistent adverse effects from vaccination were reported.
<RES> The strength of evidence is limited by the low number of included studies and by their low methodological quality (high risk of bias).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Observational data suggests a lower mortality with influenza vaccination.
<CON> Infection-related outcomes were lower or similar with influenza vaccination.
<CON> The strength of evidence is limited by the small number of studies and by the fact that only one was a RCT.
<CON> Influenza vaccination is safe and the evidence, although weak, is in favour of vaccinating adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of introducing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing malaria in areas where diagnosis has traditionally been based on clinical symptoms alone.
<ABS> After searching for relevant trials, they included seven randomized controlled trials, which enrolled 17,505 people with fever.
<ABS> What are RDTs and how might they improve patient care
<ABS> RDTs are simple to use diagnostic kits which can detect the parasites that cause malaria from one drop of the patient's blood.
<ABS> They do not require laboratory facilities or extensive training, and can provide a simple positive or negative result within 20 minutes, making them suitable for use in rural areas of Africa where most malaria cases occur.
<ABS> Improving malaria diagnosis by introducing RDTs is unlikely to improve the health outcomes of people with true malaria as they would probably have received antimalarials even if the health worker was relying on clinical symptoms alone.
<ABS> However, for patients with fever not due to malaria, RDTs could improve health outcomes by prompting the health worker to look for and treat the true cause of their fever earlier.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> In these trials, diagnosis using RDTs had little or no effect on the number of people remaining unwell four to seven days after treatment (low quality evidence).
<ABS> However, using RDTs reduced the prescription of antimalarials by up to three-quarters (moderate quality evidence), and this reduction was highest where health workers only prescribed antimalarials following a positive test, and where malaria was less common.
<ABS> Using RDTs to support diagnosis did not have a consistent effect on the prescription of antibiotics, with some trials showing an increase in antibiotic prescription and some showing a decrease (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Use of RDTs did not result in more patients with malaria being incorrectly diagnosed as not having malaria and being sent home without treatment (low quality evidence).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In 2010, the World Health Organization recommended that all patients with suspected malaria are tested for malaria before treatment.
<INT> In rural African settings light microscopy is often unavailable.
<INT> Diagnosis has relied on detecting fever, and most people were given antimalarial drugs presumptively.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials for eligible trials up to 10 January 2014.
<MaM> We contacted researchers in the field and reviewed the reference lists of all included trials to identify any additional trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted data.
<MaM> We combined data from individually and cluster RCTs using the generic inverse variance method.
<MaM> We presented all outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included seven trials, enrolling 17,505 people with fever or reported history of fever in this review; two individually randomized trials and five cluster randomized trials.
<RES> All trials were conducted in rural African settings.
<RES> In most trials the health workers diagnosing and treating malaria were nurses or clinical officers with less than one week of training in RDT supported diagnosis.
<RES> Health worker prescribing adherence to RDT results was highly variable: the number of participants with a negative RDT result who received antimalarials ranged from 0% to 81%.
<RES> Overall, RDT supported diagnosis had little or no effect on the number of participants remaining unwell at four to seven days after treatment (6990 participants, five trials, low quality evidence); but using RDTs reduced prescribing of antimalarials by up to three-quarters (17,287 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> As would be expected, the reduction in antimalarial prescriptions was highest where health workers adherence to the RDT result was high, and where the true prevalence of malaria was lower.
<RES> Using RDTs to support diagnosis did not have a consistent effect on the prescription of antibiotics, with some trials showing higher antibiotic prescribing and some showing lower prescribing in the RDT group (13,573 participants, five trials, very low quality evidence).
<RES> One trial reported malaria microscopy on all enrolled patients in an area of moderate endemicity, so we could compare the number of patients in the RDT and clinical diagnosis groups that actually had microscopy confirmed malaria infection but did not receive antimalarials.
<RES> No difference was detected between the two diagnostic strategies (1280 participants, one trial, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Concentrating on improving the care of RDT negative patients could improve health outcomes in febrile children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effects of general anaesthesia (GA) for children having day surgery.
<ABS> The GA was given to the children either by intravenous injection (injection of a drug such as propofol or thiopental) or by the child inhaling or breathing a gas such as sevoflurane or halothane through a mask.
<ABS> We found 16 studies that compared these two types of GA.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> We wanted to find out whether intravenous or inhaled anaesthesia reduced the risk of outcomes such as postoperative nausea and sickness (vomiting) (PONV) and behavioural problems in children having day surgery.
<ABS> Postoperative pain can cause behavioural problems in children.
<ABS> Mental disturbances such as hallucinations, delusions and confusion can also be evident as a child emerges from GA.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> The evidence was current to 1 October 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 16 studies (900 participants) in this review.
<ABS> All participants were otherwise healthy children (aged under 15 years) who were scheduled for day surgery.
<ABS> The studies compared different types of intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic medications.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The authors found that when compared to inhaled anaesthesia with sevoflurane, intravenous anaesthesia with propofol may reduce the risk of PONV and the risk of behavioural problems with no difference in the time to recovery from anaesthesia and discharge from hospital in children having day surgery.
<ABS> The effect on complications was imprecise.
<ABS> The studies that compared other anaesthetic agents involved different types of surgical procedures, different procedure durations and drugs, making it difficult to sum the results.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials included in this review were of poor quality and had high risk of bias.
<ABS> There was great variety in the included studies in the combinations of drugs, duration of anaesthesia and types of surgical procedures, which made the results uncertain.
<ABS> Further trials are needed to compare the types of anaesthesia used in children's ambulatory surgery.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Perioperative complications such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), postoperative behavioural disturbances and cardiorespiratory complications should be minimized in ambulatory anaesthesia.
<INT> The choice of anaesthetic agents and techniques can influence the occurrence of these complications and thus delay in discharge.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (1948 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE (1974 to 1 October 2013); Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) (1982 to 1 October 2013).
<MaM> We also handsearched relevant journals and searched the reference lists of the articles identified.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the data.
<MaM> When necessary, we requested additional information and clarification of published data from the authors of individual trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 16 trials that involved 900 children in this review.
<RES> Half of all the studies did not describe the generation of randomized sequence and most studies did not describe adequate allocation sequence concealment.
<RES> The included studies showed variability in the types and combinations of drugs and the duration of anaesthesia, limiting the meta-analysis and interpretation of the results.
<RES> For the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia there was a significant difference favouring intravenous anaesthesia with propofol; the incidence of PONV was 32.6% for sevoflurane and 16.1% for propofol (odds ratio (OR) 2.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35 to 6.49, four studies, 176 children, low quality evidence).
<RES> The risk of postoperative behavioural disturbances also favoured intravenous anaesthesiaas the incidence was 24.7% for sevoflurane and 11.5% for propofol (OR 2.67; 95% CI 1.14 to 6.23, four studies, 176 children, very low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no differences between groups in the risk of intraoperative and postoperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.27 to 2.13, three studies,130 children, very low quality evidence) and there was no difference in the time to recovery from anaesthesia and discharge from hospital.
<RES> These results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity between studies in the type and duration of operations, types of reported complications and the high risk of bias in almost all studies.
<RES> Two studies (105 participants) compared halothane to propofol and showed heterogeneity in duration of anaesthesia and in the type of ambulatory procedure.
<RES> For the risk of PONV the results of the studies were conflicting, and for the risks of intraoperative and postoperative complications there were no significant differences between the groups.
<RES> For the maintenance of anaesthesia there was a significant difference favouring anaesthesia with propofol, with or without nitrous oxide (N2O), when compared to thiopentone and halothane + N2O (OR 3.23; 95% CI 1.49 to 7.02, four studies, 176 children, low quality evidence; and OR 7.44; 95% CI 2.60 to 21.26, two studies, 87 children, low quality evidence), respectively.
<RES> For the time to discharge from the recovery room, there were no significant differences between groups.
<RES> The studies were performed with different ambulatory surgeries and a high risk of bias.
<RES> Four studies (250 participants) compared the induction of anaesthesia by the inhalational or intravenous route, with inhalational anaesthesia for maintenance, and found no significant differences between groups in all outcomes (the risk of PONV, behavioural disturbances, respiratory and cardiovascular complications and time to discharge from recovery room).
<RES> Meta-analysis was not done in this comparison because of significant clinical heterogeneity.
<RES> Readmission to hospital was not reported in any of the included studies.
<RES> No other adverse effects were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This evidence is of poor quality.
<CON> More high-quality studies are needed to compare the different types of anaesthesia in different subsets of children undergoing ambulatory surgery.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the accuracy of imaging tests to detect tears of the rotator cuff tendons in the shoulder.
<ABS> The rotator cuff is a group of tendons involved in the positioning and moving of the shoulder joint.
<ABS> The rotator cuff lets people lift their arm and reach overhead.
<ABS> In a lot of people, wear and tear of the rotator cuff tendons is a normal part of ageing and they may not have symptoms.
<ABS> However, many people will develop pain in their shoulder at some point as the tendons degenerate further and tears in the rotator cuff tendons develop.
<ABS> There may also be inflammation of the shoulder tendons or bursa (a sac with internal gliding surfaces that helps the shoulder to move).
<ABS> Often the pain is made worse by sleeping on the affected shoulder and moving the shoulder in certain directions.
<ABS> Often there will be pressure on the tendons by the overlying bone when lifting the arm up.
<ABS> This is called impingement.
<ABS> It may become difficult to use the shoulder in every day activities, sports or work.
<ABS> If the pain does not go away by itself or with treatments such as steroid injections or physiotherapy, surgery may be performed.
<ABS> Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and ultrasound (US) are used to assess the presence and size of rotator cuff tears to assist in the planning of the surgery.
<ABS> Rotator cuff tears can be classified as full or partial thickness tears based on the extent or size of the tears.
<ABS> No test is 100% accurate in identifying tears or assessing their size.
<ABS> The accuracy of the tests is commonly assessed by the sensitivity of the test (the proportion of people who had a tear according to the test, among patients with tears), and specificity (the proportion of people without tears on the test, among patients with no tears).
<ABS> We searched electronic databases up to February 2011, as well as trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles, for studies comparing diagnostic tests for people with suspected rotator cuff tears.
<ABS> Our review included 20 studies (1147 shoulders).
<ABS> Many studies had design flaws, which limited the reliability of their findings.
<ABS> We found that MRI, MRA and US may have similar accuracy for detecting the presence of full thickness tears.
<ABS> For identifying any tears (no distinction between partial or full thickness) or identifying partial thickness tears, MRI and US may also have similar accuracy.
<ABS> However, it appears that compared with US, MRI may be more sensitive in identifying partial thickness tears.
<ABS> With these results we can conclude that all three imaging tests (MRI, MRA and US) may help decisions regarding referral for surgery for people with suspected full thickness tears.
<ABS> Information on adverse effects of using these tests was not reported by the included studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Shoulder pain is a very common symptom.
<INT> Disorders of the rotator cuff tendons due to wear or tear are among the most common causes of shoulder pain and disability.
<INT> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and ultrasound (US) are increasingly being used to assess the presence and size of rotator cuff tears to assist in planning surgical treatment.
<INT> It is not known whether one imaging method is superior to any of the others.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception to February 2011.
<MaM> We also searched trial registers, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles to identify additional studies.
<MaM> No language or publication restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all prospective diagnostic accuracy studies that assessed MRI, MRA or US against arthroscopy or open surgery as the reference standard, in people suspected of having a partial or full thickness rotator cuff tear.
<MaM> We excluded studies that selected a healthy control group, or participants who had been previously diagnosed with other specific causes of shoulder pain such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
<MaM> Studies with an excessively long period (a year or longer) between the index and reference tests were also excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data on study characteristics and results of included studies, and performed quality assessment according to QUADAS criteria.
<MaM> Our unit of analysis was the shoulder.
<MaM> For each test, estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study were plotted in ROC space and forest plots were constructed for visual examination of variation in test accuracy.
<MaM> Meta-analyses were performed using the bivariate model to produce summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity.
<MaM> We were unable to formally investigate potential sources of heterogeneity because of the small number of studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 20 studies of people with suspected rotator cuff tears (1147 shoulders), of which six evaluated MRI and US (252 shoulders), or MRA and US (127 shoulders) in the same people.
<RES> Many studies had design flaws, with the potential for bias, thus limiting the reliability of their findings.
<RES> Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was judged to be low or unclear.
<RES> For each test, we observed considerable heterogeneity in study results, especially between studies that evaluated US for the detection of full thickness tears and studies that evaluated MRA for the detection of partial thickness tears.
<RES> The criteria for a positive diagnostic test (index tests and reference standard) varied between studies.
<RES> Meta-analyses were not possible for studies that assessed MRA for detection of any rotator cuff tears or partial thickness tears.
<RES> We found no statistically significant differences in sensitivity or specificity between MRI and US for detecting any rotator cuff tears (P = 0.13), or for detecting partial thickness tears (P = 1.0).
<RES> Similarly, for the comparison between MRI, MRA and US for detecting full thickness tears, there was no statistically significant difference in diagnostic performance (P = 0.7).
<RES> For any rotator cuff tears, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 98% (95% CI 92% to 99%) and 79% (95% CI 68% to 87%) respectively for MRI (6 studies, 347 shoulders), and 91% (95% CI 83% to 95%) and 85% (95% CI 74% to 92%) respectively for US (13 studies, 854 shoulders).
<RES> For full thickness tears, the summary sensitivity and specificity were 94% (95% CI 85% to 98%) and 93% (95% CI 83% to 97%) respectively for MRI (7 studies, 368 shoulders); 94% (95% CI 80% to 98%) and 92% (95% CI 83% to 97%) respectively for MRA (3 studies, 183 shoulders); and 92% (95% CI 82% to 96%) and 93% (95% CI 81% to 97%) respectively for US (10 studies, 729 shoulders).
<RES> Because few studies were direct head-to-head comparisons, we could not perform meta-analyses restricted to these studies.
<RES> The test comparisons for each of the three classifications of the target condition were therefore based on indirect comparisons which may be prone to bias due to confounding.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> MRI, MRA and US have good diagnostic accuracy and any of these tests could equally be used for detection of full thickness tears in people with shoulder pain for whom surgery is being considered.
<CON> The diagnostic performance of MRI and US may be similar for detection of any rotator cuff tears.
<CON> However, both MRI and US may have poor sensitivity for detecting partial thickness tears, and the sensitivity of US may be much lower than that of MRI.
<CON> The strength of evidence for all test comparisons is limited because most studies were small, heterogeneous and methodologically flawed, and there were few comparative studies.
<CON> Well designed studies that directly compare MRI, MRA and US for detection of rotator cuff tears are needed.

<H1> Methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Methods of intra-abdominal local anaesthetic administration in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> About 10% to 15% of the adult western population have gallstones.
<ABS> Between 1% and 4% become symptomatic each year.
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is the mainstay treatment for symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> More than half a million cholecystectomies are performed per year in the US alone.
<ABS> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (removal of gallbladder through a keyhole, also known as port) is now the preferred method of cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Pain is one the major reasons for delayed hospital discharge after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Administration of local anaesthetics (drugs that numb part of the body, similar to the ones used by the dentist to prevent the people from feeling pain) into the tummy (abdomen) is considered to be an effective way of decreasing the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> However, the best method of administration of local anaesthetics is not known.
<ABS> The controversies include which drug to use, when to administer it, whether it should be administered in the form of liquid or in the form of misty spray, and to which part of the tummy it should be administered.
<ABS> We sought to answer these questions by reviewing the medical literature and obtaining information from randomised clinical trials for assessment of benefit.
<ABS> When conducted well, such studies provide the most accurate information on the best treatment.
<ABS> We included comparative non-randomised studies for the assessment of treatment-related harms.
<ABS> Two authors searched the literature and obtained information from the studies thereby minimising errors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 12 randomised clinical trials involving 798 people undergoing planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> The trials compared different methods addressing the various controversies mentioned above.
<ABS> The choice of the method of administration of the local anaesthetic was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin so that the treatments compared were conducted in participants who were as similar as possible.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths or serious complications in either group in the comparisons that reported these.
<ABS> None of the trials reported quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, or the time taken to return to work.
<ABS> The differences in hospital stay between the methods being compared was imprecise in all the comparisons that reported hospital stay.
<ABS> Although there were some differences in the pain scores on the visual analogue scale (a chart that rates the amount of pain on a scale of 1 to 10 cm), these differences were neither consistent nor robust to different methods of statistical analysis.
<ABS> The evidence currently available is inadequate to determine the effects of one method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation compared with any other method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation in low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Most of the trials were of high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the study was conducted.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further trials are necessary.
<ABS> Such trials should include outcomes such as quality of life, the time taken to return to normal activity, and the time taken to return to work, which are important for the person undergoing the procedure and the people who provide funds for the treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation may decrease pain in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<INT> However, the optimal method to administer the local anaesthetic is unknown.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors collected the data independently.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager 5 analysis.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 12 trials with 798 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy randomised to different methods of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation.
<RES> All the trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> Most trials included only people with low anaesthetic risk.
<RES> The differences in the proportion of people who were discharged as day-surgery and the length of hospital stay were imprecise in all the comparisons included that reported these outcomes (very low quality evidence).
<RES> There were some differences in the pain scores on the visual analogue scale (1 to 10 cm) but these were neither consistent nor robust to fixed-effect versus random-effects meta-analysis or sensitivity analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The currently available evidence is inadequate to determine the effects of one method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation compared with any other method of local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation in low anaesthetic risk individuals undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<CON> Further randomised clinical trials of low risk of systematic and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should include important clinical outcomes such as quality of life and time to return to work in their assessment.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> An acute ankle sprain is a sudden-onset injury of the ankle ligaments (tough strands of tissue that connect and stabilise the bones at the ankle).
<ABS> It is one of the most common injuries in the general population as well as in athletes.
<ABS> Acupuncture is frequently used for treating ankle sprains in eastern Asian countries.
<ABS> This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults.
<ABS> We searched the medical literature for studies up to May 2013.
<ABS> Our review includes 20 studies involving 2012 people with ankle sprains.
<ABS> These studies differed from each other in many ways and compared various types of acupuncture with a variety of standard control interventions.
<ABS> Most studies reported only the 'cure rate' - the number of participants who had recovered at a set time.
<ABS> No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function.
<ABS> Only one study reported on adverse events and found skin problems in individuals receiving over-the-counter traditional Chinese herbal patches as a control intervention.
<ABS> Most trials had flaws in the way they were conducted, which makes their results less reliable; for example, most studies failed to ensure participants did not know which intervention they were receiving.
<ABS> One study, which compared acupuncture with no treatment, found more people were cured with acupuncture.
<ABS> Most of the eight studies comparing acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone found higher cure rates in the acupuncture group.
<ABS> However, we found that pooling these results did not provide conclusive evidence that acupuncture resulted in a better cure rate.
<ABS> Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese herbal patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, Chinese oral herbal medicine and elastic bandages.
<ABS> Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test.
<ABS> The pooled results from 11 studies comparing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to favour acupuncture, but this evidence was not conclusive.
<ABS> Currently, we are unable to conclude whether or not acupuncture is more effective than other standard methods for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults because of the very low quality of the available evidence.
<ABS> Because the adverse effects of acupuncture treatment were not described in most of the studies, we are also unable to draw any conclusions about the safety of acupuncture.
<ABS> Large, high quality studies of acupuncture for sudden-onset ankle sprains in adults are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> An acute ankle sprain is a sudden-onset injury of one or more of the ankle ligaments.
<INT> It is one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries in the general population as well as in athletes.
<INT> In some countries, such as China and Korea, acupuncture is frequently used in the treatment of ankle sprains, either as a single treatment or a secondary intervention accompanied by standard medical treatment.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of acupuncture for the treatment of ankle sprains in adults.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials involving adults with acute ankle sprains.
<MaM> We included all types of acupuncture practices, such as needle acupuncture, electroacupuncture, laser acupuncture, pharmacoacupuncture, non-penetrating acupuncture point stimulation (e.g. acupressure and magnets) and moxibustion.
<MaM> Acupuncture could be compared with control (no treatment or placebo) or another standard non-surgical intervention.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened the search results, assessed trial eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included a total of 20 heterogeneous studies (2012 participants with acute ankle sprains); three of which included more than one comparison.
<RES> Seventeen trials were conducted in China.
<RES> All of the studies had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding.
<RES> The results may also have been affected by selection bias, particularly as five studies were quasi-randomised controlled trials and 12 studies gave no information on their method of randomisation.
<RES> Of our three prespecified primary outcomes, only cure rate was reported by the majority of studies.
<RES> No study reported on patient-reported assessment of function and only one reported on adverse events (in which three participants receiving a control intervention experienced skin problems from over-the-counter Chinese herbal patches).
<RES> The other 19 studies did not record or report on adverse events.
<RES> We assessed the quality of evidence for cure rates as very low for all comparisons, which means we are very uncertain about the reliability of any of the estimates.
<RES> The single study comparing acupuncture treatment with no treatment found acupuncture to be more effective with regard to cure rate at five days (31/31 versus 1/30; RR 20.34, 95% CI 4.27 to 96.68).
<RES> Acupuncture plus another standard treatment versus that standard treatment alone was tested in eight studies; with cure rate data available for seven.
<RES> Most of these studies reported higher cure rates in the acupuncture plus another standard treatment group than in the standard treatment alone group.
<RES> However, while the results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from eight trials testing acupuncture versus no acupuncture tended to favour acupuncture, the results were very inconsistent across the studies and the estimated effect was very imprecise (383/396 versus 272/355; RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.84; P value = 0.1; I2 = 98%).
<RES> Fourteen studies compared acupuncture with a variety of other non-surgical treatments, such as Chinese drug patches, hot and cold water, ice packs, oral Chinese herbal medicine and elastic bandage.
<RES> Some studies found in favour of acupuncture, some in favour of the other treatment and some found a lack of evidence for a difference between the two interventions under test.
<RES> The results of an exploratory meta-analysis of cure rate data from 11 trials testing acupuncture versus another non-surgical intervention tended to slightly favour acupuncture, but these were not statistically significant and the data were very heterogeneous (404/509 versus 416/497; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.22; P value = 0.30; I2 = 92%).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Future rigorous randomised clinical trials with larger sample sizes will be necessary to establish robust clinical evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatment for acute ankle sprains.

<H1> Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Postnatal depression is a common condition that affects women and may impact on their babies.
<ABS> Common symptoms of postnatal depression include fluctuations in mood, mood changes, suicidal ideation and preoccupation with infant well-being ranging from over-concern to frank delusions.
<ABS> There is currently not much evidence regarding interventions that might prevent or treat postnatal depression.
<ABS> A diet lacking in certain vitamins, minerals or other nutrients may cause postnatal depression in some women.
<ABS> Correcting this deficiency with dietary supplements might therefore prevent postnatal depression.
<ABS> Examples of possible dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include omega-3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s-adenosyl-L-methionine, vitamin B12 (cobalamin), B6 (pyridoxine), B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D and calcium.
<ABS> This review identified two randomised controlled studies.
<ABS> One study examined the effect of selenium supplements taken by women from the first trimester to birth in preventing postnatal depression.
<ABS> This study had a high risk of bias because of women withdrawing or not completing their self-scoring system for depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale).
<ABS> It may also have been difficult to ensure that the women took their supplements because of concerns that exist about taking supplements during pregnancy.
<ABS> More high-quality studies would be required to confirm any benefit in preventing postnatal depression using selenium.
<ABS> This review also identified one randomised controlled study that compared docosahexanoic and eicosapentaenoic acid to placebo in women at risk of postpartum depression.
<ABS> This study found that neither docosahexanoic acid nor eicosapentaenoic acid prevented postpartum depression.
<ABS> Overall, there is not enough evidence at this stage to recommend selenium, docosahexanoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or any other dietary supplement for the prevention of postnatal depression.
<ABS> Unfortunately there were no other studies of other dietary supplements that met our selection criteria.
<ABS> Other dietary supplements need to be studied in trials where depressed women are excluded from entry to determine if supplements prevent postnatal depression.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Postnatal depression is a medical condition that affects many women and the development of their infants.
<INT> There is a lack of evidence for treatment and prevention strategies that are safe for mothers and infants.
<INT> Certain dietary deficiencies in a pregnant or postnatal woman's diet may cause postnatal depression.
<INT> By correcting these deficiencies postnatal depression could be prevented in some women.
<INT> Specific examples of dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include: omega-3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s-adenosyl-L-methionine, cobalamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, vitamin D and calcium.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> The trials could use as intervention any dietary supplementation alone or in combination with another treatment compared with any other preventive treatment, or placebo, or standard clinical care.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias for the two included studies.
<MaM> Two review authors extracted data and the data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two randomised controlled trials.
<RES> One trial compared oral 100 microgram (µg) selenium yeast tablets with placebo, taken from the first trimester until birth.
<RES> The trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women.
<RES> Eighty-three women were randomised to each arm of the trial.
<RES> Sixty-one women completed the selenium arm, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).
<RES> In the placebo arm, 64 women completed the trial, 41 of whom completed an EPDS.
<RES> This included study (n = 85) found selenium had an effect on EPDS scores but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).
<RES> There was a mean difference (MD) of -1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.92 to 0.12) of the self-reported EPDS completed by participants within eight weeks of delivery.
<RES> There was a high risk of attrition bias due to a large proportion of women withdrawing from the study or not completing an EPDS.
<RES> This included study did not report on any of the secondary outcomes of this review.
<RES> The other trial compared docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with placebo.
<RES> The trial randomised 126 women at risk of postpartum depression to three arms: 42 were allocated to EPA, 42 to DHA, and 42 to placebo.
<RES> Three women in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm, and one woman in the placebo arm were lost to follow-up.
<RES> Women who were found to have major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, current substance abuse or dependence, suicidal ideation or schizophrenia at recruitment were excluded from the study.
<RES> The women who discontinued the intervention (five in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm and seven in the placebo arm) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, while those who were lost to follow-up were not.
<RES> Women received supplements or placebo from recruitment at a gestational age of 12 to 20 weeks until their final review visit six to eight weeks postpartum.
<RES> The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score at the fifth visit (six to eight weeks postpartum).
<RES> No benefit was found for EPA-rich fish oil (MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.78 to 3.18) or DHA-rich fish oil supplementation (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.33 to 3.13) in preventing postpartum depression.
<RES> No difference was found in the effect on postnatal depression comparing EPA with DHA (MD -0.20, 95% CI -2.61 to 2.21).
<RES> No benefit or significant effect was found in terms of the secondary outcomes of the presence of major depressive disorder at six to eight weeks postpartum, the number of women who commenced antidepressants, maternal estimated blood loss at delivery or admission of neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute chest infections (lower respiratory tract infections) such as pneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis are a major cause of deaths worldwide and expected to be amongst the leading four causes of death by 2030.
<ABS> The most affected population groups are children under 59 months and adults over 50 years of age.
<ABS> Patients with chest infections often have a fever, cough, shortness of breath and phlegm production.
<ABS> A chest X-ray is commonly used to help diagnose and manage chest infections and is widely used in high-income countries.
<ABS> However, the impact of chest X-rays in terms of how they may change patient recovery in suspected chest infection has not been evaluated.
<ABS> We focused on whether the use of chest X-rays compared to not using them led to improved outcomes such as a faster recovery rate, less time in hospital and fewer complications for the patient.
<ABS> We did not investigate the use of chest X-rays as a tool in the diagnosis of chest infections or the differences in the interpretation of X-rays between doctors.
<ABS> Two trials with a total of 2024 participants were included in this review.
<ABS> The trial published in 1983 in the USA included only adults, while the trial in 1998 in South Africa included only children.
<ABS> Both trials were set in large metropolitan cities.
<ABS> We were unable to combine the results of the two studies due to incomplete data.
<ABS> However, both trials came to the same conclusion regarding the use of chest X-rays in chest infections, except in the subgroup of patients with evidence of infection (infiltrates) on their X-rays.
<ABS> In both adults and children, chest X-rays did not result in significant differences in recovery time.
<ABS> In summary, there were no differences in patient outcomes between the groups with or without chest X-ray.
<ABS> Although both studies suggest that chest X-rays do not improve patient outcomes, it is not clear if this finding can be applied to all populations and settings.
<ABS> Results may be different in resource poor countries.
<ABS> Our conclusions are limited due to the lack of complete data available and by the risk of bias of the studies.
<ABS> Adverse effects of chest X-rays were not assessed by either study.
<ABS> We assessed the quality of the evidence from both trials as being moderate.
<ABS> The evidence is current as of February 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) (e.g. pneumonia) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and management focuses on early treatment.
<INT> Chest radiographs (X-rays) are one of the commonly used strategies.
<INT> Although radiological facilities are easily accessible in high-income countries, access can be limited in low-income countries.
<INT> The efficacy of chest radiographs as a tool in the management of acute LRTIs has not been determined.
<INT> Although chest radiographs are used for both diagnosis and management, our review focuses only on management.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 1; MEDLINE (1948 to January week 4, 2013); EMBASE (1974 to February 2013); CINAHL (1985 to February 2013) and LILACS (1985 to February 2013).
<MaM> We also searched NHS EED, DARE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (up to February 2013).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> A third review author compiled the findings and any discrepancies were discussed among all review authors.
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two RCTs involving 2024 patients (1502 adults and 522 children) were included in this review.
<RES> Both RCTs excluded patients with suspected severe disease.
<RES> It was not possible to pool the results due to incomplete data.
<RES> Both included trials concluded that the use of chest radiographs did not result in a better clinical outcome (duration of illness and of symptoms) for patients with acute LRTIs.
<RES> In the study involving children in South Africa, the median time to recovery was seven days (95% confidence interval (CI) six to eight days (radiograph group) and six to nine days (control group)), P value = 0.50, log-rank test) and the hazard ratio for recovery was 1.08 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.34).
<RES> In the study with adult participants in the USA, the average duration of illness was 16.9 days versus 17.0 days (P value > 0.05) in the radiograph and no radiograph groups respectively.
<RES> This result was not statistically significant and there were no significant differences in patient outcomes between the groups with or without chest radiograph.
<RES> The study in adults also reports that chest radiographs did not affect the frequencies with which clinicians ordered return visits or antibiotics.
<RES> However, there was a benefit of chest radiographs in a subgroup of the adult participants with an infiltrate on their radiograph, with a reduction in length of illness (16.2 days in the group allocated to chest radiographs and 22.6 in the non-chest radiograph group, P < 0.05), duration of cough (14.2 versus 21.3 days, P < 0.05) and duration of sputum production (8.5 versus 17.8 days, P < 0.05).
<RES> The authors mention that this difference in outcome between the intervention and control group in this particular subgroup only was probably a result of "the higher proportion of patients treated with antibiotics when the radiograph was used in patient care".
<RES> Hospitalisation rates were only reported in the study involving children and it was found that a higher proportion of patients in the radiograph group (4.7%) required hospitalisation compared to the control group (2.3%) with the result not being statistically significant (P = 0.14).
<RES> None of the trials report the effect on mortality, complications of infection or adverse events from chest radiographs.
<RES> Overall, the included studies had a low or unclear risk for blinding, attrition bias and reporting bias, but a high risk of selection bias.
<RES> Both trials had strict exclusion criteria which is important but may limit the clinical practicability of the results as participants may not reflect those presenting in clinical practice.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This conclusion may be weakened by the risk of bias of the studies and the lack of complete data available.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Residual kidney function plays a key role in the health and quality of life of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
<ABS> Better preservation of residual kidney function is associated with decreased mortality, even at 1 mL/min of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is associated with a nearly 50% reduction in mortality rate.
<ABS> Two kinds of antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), are frequently prescribed for PD patients (primarily to control hypertension or heart failure), and could provide significant cardiovascular benefit for ESKD patients.
<ABS> Nowadays, while ACEis and ARBs use is advocated in PD patients, the supporting evidence is still unclear.
<ABS> However studies have focused on heart protection rather than residual kidney function.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of ACEis and ARBs therapy for preserving residual kidney function in PD patients.
<ABS> Six studies (257 patients) were included (three ARB studies, one ACEi study and ACEi versus ARB studies).
<ABS> Long-term use (12 months or more) of an ARB showed a significant benefit in preserving residual kidney function in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients compared with other antihypertensive drugs, although there was no significant benefit when an ARB were used for less than six months).
<ABS> One study showed that compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use of the ACEi ramipril showed a significant reduction in the decline of residual kidney function in patients on CAPD as well as anuria rate.
<ABS> While dizziness and cough are the main adverse events when an ACEi is used, only one study comparing an ARB with an ACEi reported this outcome and no significant difference between the two groups were found.
<ABS> While the use of an ARB or an ACEi may both be useful in preserving residual kidney function, the small number of studies and small number of patients enrolled means there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of an ACEi or an ARB as first line antihypertensive therapy in PD patients.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of last search: 01 May 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessments for each retrieved article were carried out by two authors using standardised forms.
<MaM> Authors were contacted when published data were incomplete.
<MaM> Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Heterogeneity among studies was explored using the Cochran Q statistic and the I² test, subgroup analyses and random effects meta-regression.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six open-label studies (257 patients) were identified.
<RES> One study compared ACEi with other antihypertensive drugs, three compared ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs, and two studies compared an ARB with an ACEi.
<RES> Long-term use (≥ 12 months) of an ARB showed significantly benefit of preserving residual kidney function in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients (MD 1.11 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI 0.38 to 1.83), although there was no significant benefit when an ARB were used short-term (≤ six months).
<RES> One study showed that compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use (12 months) of the ACEi ramipril showed a significant reduction in the decline of residual kidney function in patients on CAPD (MD -0.93 mL/min/1.73m², 95% CI -0.75 to -0.11), and delayed the progression to complete anuria (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.99).
<RES> There was no significant difference in serum potassium, urinary protein excretion, Kt/V, weekly creatinine clearance and blood pressure for ARBs versus other antihypertensive drugs.
<RES> Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, ramipril showed no difference in mortality and cardiovascular events.
<RES> Compared with an ACEi, ARBs did not show any difference in residual kidney function.
<RES> The selection bias assessment was low in four studies and unclear in two.
<RES> Five studies were open-label; however the primary outcome (residual kidney function) was obtained objectively from laboratory tests, and were not likely to be influenced by the lack of blinding.
<RES> Reporting bias was unclear in all six studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, long-term use (≥ 12 months) of ACEis or ARBs showed additional benefits of preserving residual kidney function in CAPD patients.
<CON> There was no significant difference on residual kidney function preservation between ARBs and ACEis.
<CON> However, limited by the small number of RCTs enrolling small number of participants, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of an ACEi or an ARB as first line antihypertensive therapy in PD patients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> The primary objective of this review was to assess the positive and negative outcomes of tighter blood glucose control ('intensive' glucose control) compared to less intense treatment targets ('conventional' glucose control) in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Treatment of type 1 diabetes consists of life-long blood sugar control through insulin replacement.
<ABS> It is generally agreed that achieving 'good' blood sugar control while avoiding episodes of very low blood sugars (severe hypoglycaemia) should be the primary treatment goal for individuals with type 1 diabetes.
<ABS> However, clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified 12 relevant studies, which included a total of 2230 participants.
<ABS> The participant populations varied widely across studies regarding age, disease duration, and existing diabetes complications.
<ABS> The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years.
<ABS> The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all studies took place in Europe or North America.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that intensive glucose control was highly effective in reducing the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications, such as retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve disease).
<ABS> For developing retinopathy, 63 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 232 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication.
<ABS> For developing nephropathy, 159 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 284 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication.
<ABS> For developing nephropathy, 49 per 1000 people with intensive glucose control compared to 139 per 1000 people with conventional glucose control experienced this diabetes complication.
<ABS> A weaker effect was found on the progression of retinopathy, while we could not find clear evidence of benefit of tight blood sugar control on the progression of nephropathy once participants had developed microalbuminuria (the kidney leaking small amounts of the protein albumin into the urine); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy.
<ABS> Major macrovascular outcomes (such as stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely; therefore we could not draw firm conclusions from the studies included in this review.
<ABS> We found that intensive glucose control can increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, however the results varied across studies and only one big study showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment.
<ABS> An analysis according to haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (a long-term measure of glucose control) at the start of the study suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia with intensive glucose control is possibly only increased for people who started the study with relatively low HbA1c values (less than 9.0%).
<ABS> There were very few data on health-related quality of life, death from any cause, and costs.
<ABS> Overall, mortality was very low in almost all studies.
<ABS> The effects of intensive glucose control on health-related quality of life were unclear and were consistent with benefit or harm.
<ABS> One study reported that intensive glucose control could be highly cost-effective when considering the potential reduction of diabetes complications in the future.
<ABS> Tight blood sugar control reduced the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications.
<ABS> The main benefits identified in this review came from studies in younger individuals who were at early stages of the disease.
<ABS> Appropriate patient training is important with these interventions in order to avoid the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.
<ABS> The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications occur.
<ABS> However, further research is needed on this issue.
<ABS> Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the effects of tight blood sugar control on older patient populations or individuals with macrovascular disease.
<ABS> There is currently no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets, therefore treatment goals need to be individualised, taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as people's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> For the majority of outcomes we evaluated the overall quality of evidence as moderate or low (analysed by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system).
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of December 2012.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the last search was December 2012 for all databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, with differences resolved by consensus.
<MaM> Overall study quality was evaluated by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system.
<MaM> Random-effects models were used for the main analyses and the results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 12 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2230 patients.
<RES> The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline.
<RES> The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years.
<RES> The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America.
<RES> Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies.
<RES> Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category.
<RES> Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P < 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P < 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P < 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence.
<RES> Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy.
<RES> For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence).
<RES> Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence).
<RES> We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment.
<RES> A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (< 9.0%).
<RES> Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Overall, all-cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end-stage diabetic nephropathy.
<RES> Health-related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost-effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Tight blood sugar control reduces the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications.
<CON> The evidence of benefit is mainly from studies in younger patients at early stages of the disease.
<CON> Benefits need to be weighed against risks including severe hypoglycaemia, and patient training is an important aspect in practice.
<CON> The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications have been manifested.
<CON> However, further research is needed on this issue.
<CON> Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from RCTs on the effects of tight blood sugar control in older patient populations or patients with macrovascular disease.
<CON> There is no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets and treatment goals need to be individualised taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as the patient's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
<ABS> Although treatment of these symptoms is widely recommended in guidelines, the best way to do this is not clear.
<ABS> Drugs are thought to have limited effectiveness in this context and carry the risk of significant side effects.
<ABS> Most participants had mild dementia, but one trial was conducted with nursing home residents who had more severe dementia.
<ABS> We found no trials of participants with MCI.
<ABS> The psychological interventions used were based on established psychological models such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling, and interpersonal psychodynamic therapy.
<ABS> In two trials, the psychological treatment was combined with other interventions.
<ABS> We found evidence that psychological treatments can reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia.
<ABS> There was also some evidence from two trials that CBT may reduce clinician-rated anxiety symptoms in people with mild dementia.
<ABS> More high quality trials in this area would be beneficial, including trials involving participants with MCI.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Experiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
<INT> Psychological interventions have been suggested as a potential treatment for these populations.
<INT> Current research suggests that people with dementia and MCI have limited opportunities for psychological treatments aimed at improving their well-being.
<INT> A systematic review of the evidence on their effectiveness is likely to be useful in terms of improving outcomes for patients and for future recommendations for practice.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We contacted authors when further information was not available from the published articles.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six RCTs involving 439 participants with dementia were included in the review, but no studies of participants with MCI were identified.
<RES> The studies included people with dementia living in the community or in nursing home care and were carried out in several countries.
<RES> Only one of the studies was classified as low risk of bias.
<RES> Five studies were at unclear or high risk of bias due to uncertainties around randomisation, blinding and selective reporting of results.
<RES> The studies used the different psychological approaches of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy and counselling.
<RES> Two studies were of multimodal interventions including a specific psychological therapy.
<RES> The comparison groups received either usual care, attention-control educational programs, diagnostic feedback or services slightly above usual care.
<RES> Meta-analysis showed a positive effect of psychological treatments on depression (6 trials, 439 participants, standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.41 to -0.03, moderate quality evidence) and on clinician-rated anxiety (2 trials, 65 participants, mean difference (MD) -4.57; 95% CI -7.81 to -1.32, low quality evidence), but not on self-rated anxiety (2 trials, SMD 0.05; 95% CI -0.44 to 0.54) or carer-rated anxiety (1 trial, MD -2.40; 95% CI -4.96 to 0.16).
<RES> Results were compatible with both benefit and harm on the secondary outcomes of patient quality of life, activities of daily living (ADLs), neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognition, or on carers' self-rated depressive symptoms, but most of the studies did not measure these outcomes.
<RES> There were no reports of adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found evidence that psychological interventions added to usual care can reduce symptoms of depression and clinician-rated anxiety for people with dementia.
<CON> We conclude that psychological interventions have the potential to improve patient well-being.
<CON> Further high quality studies are needed to investigate which treatments are most effective and to evaluate the effect of psychological interventions in people with MCI.

<H1> Neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Rehabilitation for cognitive dysfunction in people with multiple sclerosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis' (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11).
<ABS> Demyelinating disease is any condition that results in damage to the protecting covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in brain and spinal cord.
<ABS> Cognitive deficits are common in MS, occurring in about 50% to 60% of patients.
<ABS> These deficits can have a multidimensional impact on patients' activities of daily living and should be taken into account in their treatment and rehabilitation.
<ABS> Twenty relevant studies comprising a total of 986 participants (966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) were identified and included in this review.
<ABS> Cognitive training was found to improve memory span and working memory.
<ABS> Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention, immediate verbal memory and delayed memory.
<ABS> It is worth noting that the small numbers of patients in the studies and some methodological weaknesses reduce the level of the evidence.
<ABS> To further strengthen the evidence well-designed, high-quality studies are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an update of the Cochrane review 'Neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis' (first published in The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 11).
<INT> Cognitive deficits are a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS) and have a significant effect on the patient's quality of life.
<INT> Alleviation of the harmful effects caused by these deficits should be a major goal of MS research and practice.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We contacted authors of the studies for additional information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS compared to other interventions or no intervention.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors individually judged the eligibility of the included studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> We combined results quantitatively in meta-analyses according to the intervention type: 1) cognitive training and 2) cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty studies (986 participants; 966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
<RES> The mean age of the participants was 44.6 years, mean length of education was 12.3 years and 70% of the participants were women.
<RES> Most of the participants had a relapsing-remitting course of disease.
<RES> The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 3.2 and the mean duration of disease was 14.0 years.
<RES> Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention (SMD 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28, P = 0.03), immediate verbal memory (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.54, P = 0.008) and delayed memory (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, P = 0.03).
<RES> There was no evidence of an effect of neuropsychological rehabilitation on emotional functions.
<RES> The overall quality, as well as the comparability of the included studies, was relatively low due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures.
<RES> Although most of the pooled results in the meta-analyses yielded no significant findings, 18 of the 20 studies showed some evidence of positive effects when the studies were individually analysed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Without treatment people die, and proper treatment can result in cure, so diagnosis is important.
<ABS> Now rapid diagnostic tests that are safe and easy to perform are available.
<ABS> This Cochrane review describes how accurate these rapid diagnostic tests are for diagnosing visceral leishmaniasis.
<ABS> We summarize those studies that evaluated the rapid tests in people who, according to their physicians, could have the disease.
<ABS> We only included studies in which the researchers had used established methods to distinguish the people with visceral leishmaniasis from those who did not have the disease.
<ABS> We found 24 studies, which contained information about five different rapid tests.
<ABS> A total of 4271 people participated in these studies.
<ABS> One of the rapid tests (called the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% of the people who did not have the disease.
<ABS> This test worked better in India and Nepal than in east Africa.
<ABS> In India and Nepal, it gave correct, positive results in 97% of the people with the disease.
<ABS> In east Africa, it gave correct, positive results in only 85% of the people with the disease.
<ABS> A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease.
<ABS> For the other rapid tests evaluated, there are too few studies to know how accurate they are.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Parasitological techniques are invasive, require sophisticated laboratories, consume time, or lack accuracy.
<INT> Recently, rapid diagnostic tests that are easy to perform have become available.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> This review includes original, phase III, diagnostic accuracy studies of rapid tests in patients clinically suspected to have VL.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality of included studies using the QUADAS-2 tool.
<MaM> Discrepancies were resolved by a third author.
<MaM> We carried out a meta-analysis to estimate sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests, using a bivariate normal model with a complementary log-log link function.
<MaM> We analysed each index test separately.
<MaM> As possible sources of heterogeneity, we explored: geographical area, commercial brand of index test, type of reference standard, disease prevalence, study size, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2).
<MaM> We also undertook a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of imperfect reference standards.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-four studies containing information about five index tests (rK39 immunochromatographic test (ICT), KAtex latex agglutination test in urine, FAST agglutination test, rK26 ICT, and rKE16 ICT) recruiting 4271 participants (2605 with VL) were included.
<RES> We carried out a meta-analysis for the rK39 ICT (including 18 studies; 3622 participants) and the latex agglutination test (six studies; 1374 participants).
<RES> The results showed considerable heterogeneity.
<RES> For the rK39 ICT, the overall sensitivity was 91.9% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 84.8 to 96.5) and the specificity 92.4% (95% CI 85.6 to 96.8).
<RES> The sensitivity was lower in East Africa (85.3%; 95% CI 74.5 to 93.2) than in the Indian subcontinent (97.0%; 95% CI 90.0 to 99.5).
<RES> For the latex agglutination test, overall sensitivity was 63.6% (95% CI 40.9 to 85.6) and specificity 92.9% (95% CI 76.7 to 99.2).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Other rapid tests lack accuracy, validation, or both.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Aloe vera for prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Infusion phlebitis is acute inflammation of a vein in the presence of intravenous therapy.
<ABS> In modern medical practice, more than 80% of inpatients will receive intravenous therapy during their admission, and about 20% to 70% of them may develop infusion phlebitis.
<ABS> Therefore infusion phlebitis is the most common complication of intravenous therapy.
<ABS> However, routine treatments for prevention or treatment of phlebitis such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory.
<ABS> This review examined 35 randomised controlled trials and eight quasi-randomised controlled trials with 7465 participants.
<ABS> Twenty-two trials with 5546 participants were involved in looking at prevention of phlebitis with Aloe vera, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in looking at Aloe vera for the treatment of phlebitis.
<ABS> The included trials mainly compared external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or with another non-Aloe vera treatment such as a wet compress of 75% alcohol or 33%, 50% or 75% MgSO4 with no treatment or the same non-Aloe vera treatment.
<ABS> The duration of intervention lasted from one day to 15 days.
<ABS> Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias.
<ABS> The incidence of phlebitis at varying degrees of severity as well as the resolution rate and level of improvement of phlebitis were investigated.
<ABS> The available evidence suggests that external application of fresh Aloe vera alone or combined with other non-Aloe vera treatment may be effective for the prevention and treatment of infusion phlebitis resulting from the intravenous therapy.
<ABS> The conclusions should be cautiously interpreted due to the low methodological quality of the included trials.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Up to 80% of hospitalised patients receive intravenous therapy at some point during their admission.
<INT> About 20% to 70% of patients receiving intravenous therapy develop phlebitis.
<INT> Infusion phlebitis has become one of the most common complications in patients with intravenous therapy.
<INT> However, the effects of routine treatments such as external application of 75% alcohol or 50% to 75% magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) are unsatisfactory.
<INT> Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new methods to prevent and alleviate infusion phlebitis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator (TSC) searched the Specialised Register (last searched February 2014) and CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1).
<MaM> In addition the TSC searched MEDLINE to week 5 January 2014, EMBASE to Week 6 2014 and AMED to February 2014.
<MaM> The authors searched the following Chinese databases until 28 February 2014: Chinese BioMedical Database; Traditional Chinese Medical Database System; China National Knowledge Infrastructure; Chinese VIP information; Chinese Medical Current Contents; Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database; and China Medical Academic Conference.
<MaM> Bibliographies of retrieved and relevant publications were searched.
<MaM> There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted the data on the study characteristics, description of methodology and outcomes of the eligible trials, and assessed study quality.
<MaM> Data were analysed using RevMan 5.1.
<MaM> For dichotomous outcomes, the effects were estimated by using risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI).
<MaM> For continuous outcomes, mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs were used to estimate their effects.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 43 trials (35 RCTs and eight qRCTs) with 7465 participants were identified.
<RES> Twenty-two trials with 5546 participants were involved in prevention of Aloe vera for phlebitis, and a further 21 trials with 1919 participants were involved in the treatment of phlebitis.
<RES> The included studies compared external application of Aloe vera alone or plus non-Aloe vera interventions with no treatment or the same non-Aloe vera interventions.
<RES> The duration of the intervention lasted from one day to 15 days.
<RES> Most of the included studies were of low methodological quality with concerns for selection bias, attrition bias, reporting bias and publication bias.
<RES> The effects of external application of fresh Aloe vera on preventing total incidence of phlebitis varied across the studies and we did not combine the data.
<RES> Aloe vera reduced the occurrence of third degree phlebitis (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.11, P < 0.00001) and second degree phlebitis (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31, P < 0.00001) compared with no treatment.
<RES> Compared with external application of 75% alcohol, or 33% MgSO4 alone, Aloe vera reduced the total incidence of phlebitis (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.28, P = 0.004 and RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78, P = 0.005 respectively) but there was no clear evidence of an effect when compared with 50% or 75% MgSO4 (total incidence of phlebitis RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.07, P = 0.07 and RR 1.10 95% CI 0.54 to 2.25, P = 0.79 respectively; third degree phlebitis (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.02, P = 0.051 and RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 18.73, P = 0.9 respectively; second degree phlebitis RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.23, P = 0.53 compared to 75% MgSO4) except for a reduction in second degree phlebitis when Aloe vera was compared with 50% MgSO4 (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50, P < 0.0001).
<RES> For the treatment of phlebitis, Aloe vera was more effective than 33% or 50% MgSO4 in terms of both any improvement (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.24, P < 0.0001 and RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.28, P < 0.0001 respectively) and marked improvement of phlebitis (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.70, P < 0.001 and RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.87, P = 0.0002 respectively).
<RES> Compared with 50% MgSO4, Aloe vera also improved recovery rates from phlebitis (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.61, P < 0.0001).
<RES> Compared with routine treatments such as external application of hirudoid, sulphonic acid mucopolysaccharide and dexamethasone used alone, addition of Aloe vera improved recovery from phlebitis (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.46, P = 0.001) and had a positive effect on overall improvement (marked improvement RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.47, P = 0.0003; any improvement RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35, P < 0.0001).
<RES> Aloe vera, either alone or in combination with routine treatment, was more effective than routine treatment alone for improving the symptoms of phlebitis including shortening the time of elimination of red swelling symptoms, time of pain relief at the location of the infusion vein and time of resolution of phlebitis.
<RES> Other secondary outcomes including health-related quality of life and adverse effects were not reported in the included studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no strong evidence for preventing or treating infusion phlebitis with external application of Aloe vera.
<CON> The current available evidence is limited by the poor methodological quality and risk of selective outcome reporting of the included studies, and by variation in the size of effect across the studies.
<CON> The positive effects observed with external application of Aloe vera in preventing or treating infusion phlebitis compared with no intervention or external application of 33% or 50% MgSO4 should therefore be viewed with caution.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in Alzheimer's disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What difficulties are caused by sleep problems brought on by Alzheimer's disease?
<ABS> People with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) frequently suffer from sleep disturbances.
<ABS> These can include a reduction in the time spent asleep at night, frequent wakening after falling asleep, wandering at night, waking early, and sleeping excessively during the daytime.
<ABS> These behaviours cause a lot of stress to carers, and may be associated with earlier admission to long-term care facilities (care homes) for people with AD.
<ABS> These behaviours can also be difficult for care-home staff to manage well.
<ABS> Can medicines help?
<ABS> Treatment with medicines is often used to try to improve the sleep of people with AD.
<ABS> Since the source of the sleep problems may be changes in the brain caused by AD, it is not clear whether normal sleeping pills will be effective for people with AD, and there are worries that the medicines could cause significant side effects (harms).
<ABS> The purpose of this review
<ABS> In this Cochrane review, we tried to identify the benefits and common harms of any medicine used to treat sleep problems in people with AD.
<ABS> Findings of this review
<ABS> We searched the medical literature up to 31 March 2013 for all randomized medical trials that compared any medicine used for treating sleep problems in people with AD with a fake medicine (placebo).
<ABS> We found five trials (313 participants) that investigated three medicines: melatonin (three trials), trazodone (one trial) and ramelteon (one trial).
<ABS> The ramelteon trial was commercially funded; the other trials had non-commercial funding sources.
<ABS> Very limited information was available for the ramelteon trial, and it came from the trial's sponsor.
<ABS> Participants in the melatonin and trazodone trials had moderate to severe dementia, while those in the ramelteon trial had mild to moderate dementia.
<ABS> The three melatonin trials had a total of 209 participants.
<ABS> There was no evidence that melatonin improved sleep.
<ABS> No serious harms were reported.
<ABS> The trazodone trial had 30 participants.
<ABS> It showed that a low dose of the sedative anti-depressant trazodone, 50 mg, given at night for two weeks, increased the total time spent asleep each night by an average of 43 minutes.
<ABS> This medicine improved sleep efficiency (the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping), but had no effect on the time spent awake after falling asleep, or on the number of times the participants woke up at night.
<ABS> No serious harms were reported.
<ABS> The ramelteon trial had 74 participants.
<ABS> The limited information available did not provide any evidence that ramelteon was better than placebo.
<ABS> There were no serious harms caused by ramelteon.
<ABS> The trials did not report on some of the outcomes which interested us, including quality of life and the impact on carers.
<ABS> Shortcomings of this review
<ABS> Although we searched for them, we were not able to find any trials of other sleeping medications that are commonly prescribed to people with AD.
<ABS> We concluded that there is very little evidence to guide decisions about medicines for sleeping problems in AD.
<ABS> Any medicine used should be used cautiously, with a careful assessment of how well it works, and its risks, and side effects in individual patients.
<ABS> More trials are needed to inform medical practice, with a particular need for trials investigating medicines that are commonly used for sleep problems in AD.
<ABS> It is essential that trials include careful assessment of side effects.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors working independently extracted data on study design, risk of bias and results from the included study reports.
<MaM> Additional information was obtained from study authors where necessary.
<MaM> We used the mean difference as the measure of treatment effect and, where possible, synthesized results using a fixed-effect model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found RCTs eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available).
<RES> The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe AD; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate AD.
<RES> In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems.
<RES> All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy.
<RES> In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy.
<RES> Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects.
<RES> Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties.
<RES> The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.
<RES> We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with AD.
<RES> We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies).
<RES> Other outcomes were reported in single studies.
<RES> We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADLs).
<RES> No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies.
<RES> Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study).
<RES> No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or ADLs.
<RES> No serious adverse effects were reported.
<RES> Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis.
<RES> Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment).
<RES> The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance.
<RES> There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in AD.
<CON> In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in AD, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments.
<CON> From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to AD patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems.
<CON> There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits.
<CON> There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD.
<CON> This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in AD.
<CON> Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.

<H1> EEG for children with complex febrile seizures

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> EEG for children with complex febrile seizures

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Febrile seizures can be classified as simple or complex.
<ABS> Complex febrile seizures are associated with fever that lasts longer than 15 minutes, occur more than once within 24 hours and are confined to one side of the child's body.
<ABS> It is common in some countries for doctors to recommend an electroencephalograph (EEG) on children with complex febrile seizures.
<ABS> Limited evidence is available to prove or refute the use of an EEG and its timing after complex febrile seizures in children; therefore the authors decided to undertake this systematic review.
<ABS> We attempted to search all possible sources (searches carried out on 17 October 2013) but were unable to find even a single randomised controlled trial (regarded as a gold standard for trial design) to address the issue.
<ABS> We concluded that no base of high-quality evidence can be found to support or refute the use of an EEG and its timing after complex febrile seizures in children.
<ABS> Therefore well-designed randomised trials are required.
<ABS> We intend to update this review regularly with the hope that new randomised studies will be reported in the future.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Febrile seizures can be classified as simple or complex.
<INT> Complex febrile seizures are associated with fever that lasts longer than 15 minutes, occur more than once within 24 hours and are confined to one side of the child's body.
<INT> It is common in some countries for doctors to recommend an electroencephalograph (EEG) for children with complex febrile seizures.
<INT> A limited evidence base is available to support the use of EEG and its timing after complex febrile seizures among children.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors selected and retrieved the articles and independently assessed which articles should be included.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved by discussion and by consultation with the Cochrane Epilepsy Group.
<MaM> We applied standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Colloboration.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no RCTs as evidence to support or refute the use of EEG and its timing after complex febrile seizures among children.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a type of cancer that occurs in the brain or spinal cord.
<ABS> It is a rare and aggressive type of lymphoma.
<ABS> People who develop PCNSL survive for only four months on average, if they do not receive treatment.
<ABS> For a long time the only treatment showing any benefit was whole brain radiotherapy (WBR), in which X-rays are used to destroy cancerous cells in the brain.
<ABS> However, several studies suggest that this treatment method also produces signs of damage to healthy brain tissue.
<ABS> Since the introduction of methotrexate, a powerful chemotherapy drug showing great beneficial effects, experts have debated the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of people with PCNSL.
<ABS> Radiotherapy could be combined with chemotherapy, or not used at all, especially considering its potentially harmful effects.
<ABS> Review question: The aim of this review was to find any scientific studies of high quality that focus on the effectiveness and harmful effects of radiotherapy in the treatment of PCNSL.
<ABS> A broad search of all relevant databases produced 556 references regarding this topic.
<ABS> Only one study fulfilled the strict inclusion criteria and was thus analysed in detail.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We searched all databases for relevant studies published between January 1950 and February 2014.
<ABS> We included only one study that enrolled 551 participants and treated one half with methotrexate followed by WBR, and the other half with methotrexate alone.
<ABS> If participants in the latter group did not respond sufficiently to methotrexate alone, another drug, cytarabine, was given.
<ABS> Participants of a minimum of 18 years of age were enrolled at 75 centres in Germany between May 2000 and May 2009.
<ABS> Key results: When we analysed the data regarding the effect of chemotherapy plus WBR or chemotherapy alone on overall survival, the results were imprecise and either treatment could have been superior to the other.
<ABS> Another outcome we considered in addition to overall survival was progression-free survival (PFS), a state in which the disease does not get any worse.
<ABS> The addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy had a positive effect on PFS, slightly extending the period in which the disease did not progress in comparison to that acheived with chemotherapy alone.
<ABS> We found no evidence that treatment-related symptoms of brain function impairment were more common in the group of participants receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy than in those receiving chemotherapy alone.
<ABS> Quality of evidence: We consider the quality of the evidence body as moderate to low, as we included only one trial with a small number of participants.
<ABS> As the included study did not analyse adverse events in all participants, we consider the quality of the evidence for the outcome of neurotoxicity as very low.
<ABS> Conclusion: In summary, the currently available evidence (one randomised controlled trial) is not sufficient to conclude that WBR plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone have similar effects on overall survival in people with PCNSL.
<ABS> The addition of WBR to chemotherapy may increase progression-free survival, but could possibly also increase levels of toxic effects on the brain.
<ABS> Further prospective randomised trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the role of adding radiotherapy to chemotherapy in the treatment of PCNSL.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with chemotherapy alone in individuals with PCNSL.
<MaM> Outcomes defined in this review were overall survival, progression-free survival, response to treatment, adverse events, treatment related mortality and quality of life.
<MaM> We excluded trials in which the chemotherapy regimen differed between treatment arms, trials in which fewer than 80% of participants had PCNSL or those recruiting immunocompromised individuals with PCNSL.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened the results of the search strategies for eligibility for this review.
<MaM> Both assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> Where relevant data was unavailable, we contacted the investigator by email.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the 556 potentially relevant studies only two met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> One of those was excluded as the trial was abandoned prematurely and reported only preliminary results.
<RES> The only analysed trial enrolled 551 participants receiving first-line chemotherapy (methotrexate) followed by whole brain radiotherapy (WBR) or receiving chemotherapy only (methotrexate followed by cytarabine in case of incomplete response).
<RES> In this non-inferiority trial, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 411 participants and the per-protocol (PP) population of 318 participants.
<RES> We judged the potential for risk of bias in this open-label study as moderate.
<RES> The estimated effect of chemotherapy plus WBR on survival was similar to that with chemotherapy alone but due to a wide CI we could not rule out the superiority of either therapy.
<RES> This applied to both the ITT population (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.30; P = 0.94) and the PP population (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.40; P = 0.71) (moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Due to the low number of participants and a risk of detection bias we found low-quality evidence for an improvement in progression-free survival in participants in the ITT population receiving WBR in addition to chemotherapy (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; P = 0.041).
<RES> An improvement in PFS was also observed with WBR plus chemotherapy in participants in the PP population, but the CI was slightly wider and the result not significant (HR 0.82,95% CI 0.64 to 1.07; P = 0.14).
<RES> Treatment-related mortality and health-related quality of life were not evaluated.
<RES> Treatment-related neurotoxicity was assessed clinically in 79 participants, revealing signs of neurotoxicity in 49% of those receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and in 26% of those receiving chemotherapy only (RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.48; P = 0.054) (very-low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In summary, the currently available evidence (one RCT) is not sufficient to conclude that WBR plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone have similar effects on overall survival in people with PCNSL.
<CON> The findings suggest that the addition of radiotherapy (WBR) to chemotherapy may increase progression-free survival, but may also increase the incidence of neurotoxicity compared to chemotherapy only (methotrexate monotherapy).
<CON> As the role of chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of PCNSL remains unclear, further prospective, randomised trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background and importance
<ABS> Critically ill patients receiving assistance from breathing machines (ventilators) may be restored to normal breathing using clinical methods (collectively termed weaning) that require both expertise and continuous monitoring.
<ABS> Inefficient weaning may result in a prolonged time on a ventilator, putting patients at risk of lung injury, pneumonia and death.
<ABS> At times, delivery of the most effective and efficient care can be difficult due to organizational constraints.
<ABS> Computerized weaning systems may provide a solution to inefficient weaning methods.
<ABS> In this Cochrane review we evaluated if computerized weaning systems were more effective than clinical methods used by clinicians for reducing inappropriate delays in weaning, the overall duration of ventilation, and the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays.
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We identified 21 studies that provided information on a total of 1676 people including 1628 adults and 48 children.
<ABS> The evidence was current to 30th September 2013.
<ABS> Studies were conducted in people with medical reasons such as pneumonia and other infections for needing admission to ICU, people admitted following trauma, and people admitted after heart or other forms of surgery.
<ABS> As well, various commercially available computerized weaning systems were studied.
<ABS> We found that computerized weaning systems resulted in a reduced weaning duration as well as reduced overall time on the ventilator and stay in an ICU.
<ABS> The average time required for a person to be weaned off the ventilator was reduced by 30%.
<ABS> The overall time on the ventilator was reduced by 10% and the length of stay in ICU by 8%.
<ABS> Not all studies demonstrated these reductions.
<ABS> Studies conducted only in people admitted to ICU following surgery did not demonstrate reductions in weaning, overall time on a ventilator or ICU stay.
<ABS> Limitations
<ABS> Because of differences in the methods and results of some studies included in this review, further large scale research is warranted.
<ABS> There is also a need for more studies that examine the effect of computerized weaning systems in children.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review was originally published in 2013 with an update published in 2014.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Secondary objectives for this review were to determine differences in the duration of ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay (LOS), mortality, and adverse events related to early or delayed extubation with the use of automated weaning systems compared to weaning in the absence of an automated weaning system.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8); MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1948 to September 2013); EMBASE (OvidSP) (1980 to September 2013); CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (1982 to September 2013); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS).
<MaM> Relevant published reviews were sought using the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA Database).
<MaM> We also searched the Web of Science Proceedings; conference proceedings; trial registration websites; and reference lists of relevant articles.
<MaM> The original search was run in August 2011, with database auto-alerts up to August 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted study data and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> We combined data in forest plots using random-effects modelling.
<MaM> Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted according to a priori criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 21 trials (19 adult, two paediatric) totaling 1676 participants (1628 adults, 48 children) in this updated review.
<RES> Pooled data from 16 eligible trials reporting weaning duration indicated that automated closed loop systems reduced the geometric mean duration of weaning by 30% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13% to 45%), however heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 87%, P < 0.00001).
<RES> Reduced weaning duration was found with mixed or medical ICU populations (42%, 95% CI 10% to 63%) and Smartcare/PS™ (28%, 95% CI 7% to 49%) but not in surgical populations or using other systems.
<RES> Automated closed loop systems reduced the duration of ventilation (10%, 95% CI 3% to 16%) and ICU LOS (8%, 95% CI 0% to 15%).
<RES> There was no strong evidence of an effect on mortality rates, hospital LOS, reintubation rates, self-extubation and use of non-invasive ventilation following extubation.
<RES> Prolonged mechanical ventilation > 21 days and tracheostomy were reduced in favour of automated systems (relative risk (RR) 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.95 and RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.90 respectively).
<RES> Overall the quality of the evidence was high with the majority of trials rated as low risk.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Automated closed loop systems may result in reduced duration of weaning, ventilation and ICU stay.
<CON> Reductions are more likely to occur in mixed or medical ICU populations.
<CON> Due to the lack of, or limited, evidence on automated systems other than Smartcare/PS™ and Adaptive Support Ventilation no conclusions can be drawn regarding their influence on these outcomes.
<CON> There is a pressing need for further technological development and research in the paediatric population.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Interventions for the treatment of Paget's disease of the vulva

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> No evidence was available for the comparison of different interventions for women with Paget's disease of the vulva

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Extramammary Paget’s disease of the vulva is a rare type of superficial skin cancer.
<ABS> It is most common in postmenopausal white women.
<ABS> It is an intraepithelial (layer of cells that forms the surface or lining of an organ) condition that can present as white and red scaly areas on the vulva that may be itchy and painful.
<ABS> The diagnosis is made by examination and tissue sampling.
<ABS> Abnormal cells often extend outside the clinically abnormal area, so some studies suggest frozen section at time of surgery, where a pathologist can give a rapid report of small biopsies to say whether the skin is involved with Paget's or not.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatments for Paget's disease of the vulva.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched for randomised controlled trials (trials where treatment is allocate to women in a random manner) and well-designed non-randomised studies that compared different treatments in women aged 18 years or older with biopsy-confirmed Paget's disease of the vulva.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> and quality of evidence
<ABS> We searched scientific databases and contacted experts and identified and checked the titles and abstracts of 635 possibly relevant articles and retrieved 31 of these references in full text.
<ABS> However, we found no studies that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> We identified a number of non-randomised studies and drafted a detailed narrative of their results, but these studies were of poor quality and were at high risk of bias.
<ABS> Therefore, there is currently no evidence to determine whether any form of treatment is better or worse in terms of prolonging survival, delaying progression or recurrence, improving quality of life or minimising toxicity.
<ABS> The review highlights the need for good-quality studies comparing different interventions for the management of Paget's disease of the vulva.
<ABS> Women and clinicians would value more evidence for guiding surgical and non-surgical management of this disease.
<ABS> In particular, non-invasive medical management would spare women from the adverse effects and consequences of surgery.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Extra-mammary Paget's disease is a rare form of superficial skin cancer.
<INT> The most common site of involvement is the vulva.
<INT> It is seen mainly in postmenopausal white women.
<INT> Paget's disease of the vulva often spreads in an occult fashion, with margins extending beyond the apparent edges of the lesion.
<INT> There is a range of interventions from surgical to non-invasive techniques or treatments.
<INT> The challenges of interventions are to remove or treat disease that may not be visible, without overtreatment and with minimisation of morbidity from radical surgery.
<INT> There is little consensus regarding treatment.
<INT> Surgery, by default, is the most common treatment, but it is challenging to excise the disease adequately, and recurrence is common, leading to repeated operations, and destruction of anatomy.
<INT> Alternative treatments of photodynamic therapy, laser therapy, radiotherapy, topical treatments or even chemotherapy have been mooted, and it is important to evaluate the available evidence.
<INT> It is essential to assess whether newer cell-specific treatments, such as photodynamic therapy and imiquimod, can reduce the need for radical surgery.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To evaluate the benefits and harms of different treatment modalities for the management of Paget's disease of the vulva.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to September 2013.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles and contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> We found no trials and, therefore, no data were analysed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified 635 unique references.
<RES> We found 31 references (which reported on 30 studies) in full text after inspection of titles and abstracts, but we excluded them all as they did not meet the inclusion criteria.
<RES> However, we have included a comprehensive narrative account of studies where we identified an analysis of more than 10 women, as this forms the only evidence base in this rare disease.
<RES> Surgery continues to be the mainstay of treatment in the current literature, with other treatments limited to case reports or treatment of inoperable or recurrent disease.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no reliable evidence to inform decisions about different interventions for women with Paget's disease of the vulva.
<CON> Ideally, a multicentre RCT of reasonable size is needed.
<CON> In particular, evidence regarding the increasing use of imiquimod would be helpful to women and clinicians alike.
<CON> Well-designed non-randomised studies, that use multivariate analysis to adjust for baseline imbalances, as well as other key methodological strengths, are also lacking.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Comparison of two methods used in screening for colorectal cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cancer in the large intestine (colon) and rectum is one of the most frequent cancers in developed countries.
<ABS> The disease develops from benign lesions over a time span of about 10 years.
<ABS> If the lesion has turned into cancer, the prognosis is far better if the disease is detected at an early stage.
<ABS> Screening and detection for early cancers and benign precursors may therefore reduce the number of deaths caused by this disease.
<ABS> Cancers and benign precursors may bleed, and the blood can be detected in the stool by specific tests, the so-called faecal occult blood tests (FOBT).
<ABS> If the test is positive (that is blood is detected), the person will be offered a colonoscopy to find the source of bleeding.
<ABS> Unfortunately, FOBT fails to discover a considerable number of cancers and precursor lesions.
<ABS> Therefore, endoscopic examination of the rectum and lower large intestine (the sigmoid colon) has been advocated (called flexible sigmoidoscopy).
<ABS> Flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed with a flexible instrument inserted through the anus and introduced about 50 centimetres into the lower large intestine after cleansing with a small enema.
<ABS> This allows direct visual inspection of the interior wall of the intestine, and benign lesions and malignant tumours may be detected.
<ABS> Benign lesions may be removed in the same session without anaesthesia and without any discomfort for the patient, and a follow-up colonoscopy may be offered.
<ABS> The purpose of this review was to compare the two screening methods (FOBT and flexible sigmoidoscopy) in their ability to reduce the number of deaths due to cancer in the large intestine and rectum.
<ABS> We identified four trials which compared FOBT to no screening and five trials which compared flexible sigmoidoscopy to no screening.
<ABS> No studies compared the two methods directly.
<ABS> Mortality from colorectal cancer was reduced with FOBT screening and screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy.
<ABS> When we compared the two methods, we could not conclude that one was better than the other.
<ABS> No complications occurred after the FOBT test itself, but 0.03% of participants suffered a major complication after follow-up.
<ABS> Among more than 60,000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screening procedures and almost 6000 work-up colonoscopies, a major complication was recorded in 0.08% of participants.
<ABS> These findings should be interpreted with caution as the reporting of adverse effects was incomplete.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Colorectal cancer is the third most frequent cancer in the world.
<INT> As the sojourn time for this cancer is several years and a good prognosis is associated with early stage diagnosis, screening has been implemented in a number of countries.
<INT> Both screening with faecal occult blood test and flexible sigmoidoscopy have been shown to reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in randomised controlled trials.
<INT> The comparative effectiveness of these tests on colorectal cancer mortality has, however, never been evaluated, and controversies exist over which test to choose.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials comparing screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy or faecal occult blood testing to each other or to no screening.
<MaM> Only studies reporting mortality from colorectal cancer were included.
<MaM> Faecal occult blood testing had to be repeated (annually or biennially).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data retrieval and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently by two review authors.
<MaM> Standard meta-analyses using a random-effects model were conducted for flexible sigmoidoscopy and faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) separately and we calculated relative risks with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> We used a Bayesian approach (a contrast-based network meta-analysis method) for indirect analyses and presented the results as posterior median relative risk with 95% credibility intervals.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified nine studies comprising 338,467 individuals randomised to screening and 405,919 individuals to the control groups.
<RES> Five studies compared flexible sigmoidoscopy to no screening and four studies compared repetitive guaiac-based FOBT (annually and biennially) to no screening.
<RES> We did not consider that study risk of bias reduced our confidence in our results.
<RES> We did not identify any studies comparing the two screening methods directly.
<RES> When compared with no screening, colorectal cancer mortality was lower with flexible sigmoidoscopy (relative risk 0.72; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.79, high quality evidence) and FOBT (relative risk 0.86; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.92, high quality evidence).
<RES> In the analyses based on indirect comparison of the two screening methods, the relative risk of dying from colorectal cancer was 0.85 (95% credibility interval 0.72 to 1.01, low quality evidence) for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening compared to FOBT.
<RES> No complications occurred after the FOBT test itself, but 0.03% of participants suffered a major complication after follow-up.
<RES> Among more than 60,000 flexible sigmoidoscopy screening procedures and almost 6000 work-up colonoscopies, a major complication was recorded in 0.08% of participants.
<RES> Adverse event data should be interpreted with caution as the reporting of adverse effects was incomplete.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Major complications associated with screening require validation from studies with more complete reporting of harms.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Cannabinoids for epilepsy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Cannabinoids for epilepsy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Epilepsy is a disorder of recurrent unprovoked seizures.
<ABS> More than half of seizures can be controlled by anti-epileptic medications.
<ABS> For the remaining patients, they may wish to try other agents to obtain better control.
<ABS> Marijuana, or cannabinoids, may be one such agent.
<ABS> This review assessed the efficacy of marijuana, or cannabinoids, as a treatment for epilepsy.
<ABS> No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy.
<ABS> Further trials are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Marijuana appears to have anti-epileptic effects in animals.
<INT> It is not currently known if it is effective in patients with epilepsy.
<INT> Some states in the United States of America have explicitly approved its use for epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (9 September 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (Ovid) (9 September 2013), ISI Web of Knowledge (9 September 2013), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) (9 September 2013), and ClinicalTrials.gov (9 September 2013).
<MaM> In addition, we included studies we personally knew about that were not found by the searches, as well as searched the references in the identified studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the data.
<MaM> The primary outcome investigated was seizure freedom at one year or more, or three times the longest interseizure interval.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included responder rate at six months or more, objective quality of life data, and adverse events.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found four randomized trial reports that included a total of 48 patients, each of which used cannabidiol as the treatment agent.
<RES> One report was an abstract and another was a letter to the editor.
<RES> Anti-epileptic drugs were continued in all studies.
<RES> Details of randomisation were not included in any study report.
<RES> There was no investigation of whether the control and treatment participant groups were the same or different.
<RES> All the reports were low quality.
<RES> The four reports only answered the secondary outcome about adverse effects.
<RES> None of the patients in the treatment groups suffered adverse effects.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Combined use of oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriage

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The hormones oestrogen and progesterone have established physiological roles in maintaining pregnancy.
<ABS> It has been suggested that supplementation of these hormones could help prevent miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy, particularly in women who have low levels of the hormones, in assisted reproductive technology programs, or who have a history of repeated miscarriages.
<ABS> In our review of randomised controlled trials published in major scientific databases, we only identified two trials that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> The two trials involved small numbers of women.
<ABS> One involved 161 women with diabetes who took oral placebo or oral diethylstilboestrol and ethisterone in increasing doses from before the end of the 16th week until birth.
<ABS> The other trial involved 120 women with pregnancy assisted by in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer who continued treatment until the completed 12th week of gestation.
<ABS> From the little evidence available, the two trials found no evidence that combined oestrogen and progestogen can prevent miscarriage (progestogen is a major class of hormones which includes progesterone) when compared with placebo or usual care.
<ABS> The first of the two studies indicated an increased risk for the mothers who used hormonal therapy during pregnancy of developing cancer later in life.
<ABS> Diethylstilboestrol is no longer in use and poses serious adverse effects while ethisterone contains androgenic properties thought to be responsible for genital abnormalities and has been replaced by progesterone.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of combined oestrogen and progesterone for preventing miscarriage.
<MaM> We included one stratified randomised trial and one quasi-randomised trials.
<MaM> Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.
<MaM> We excluded studies published only as abstracts.
<MaM> We included studies that compared oestrogen and progesterone versus placebo or no intervention.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality.
<MaM> Two review authors extracted data.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two trials (281 pregnancies and 282 fetuses) met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> However, the two trials had significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity such that a meta-analysis combining trial data was considered inappropriate.
<RES> One trial (involving 161 pregnancies) was based on women with a history of diabetes.
<RES> It showed no statistically significant difference between using combined oestrogen and progestogen and using placebo for all our proposed primary outcomes, namely, miscarriage (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32 to 2.80), perinatal death (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.69) and preterm birth (less than 34 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04).
<RES> In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, use of combined oestrogen and progestogen was associated with an increased risk of maternal cancer in the reproductive system (RR 6.65, 95% CI 1.56 to 28.29).
<RES> However, for the outcome of cancer other than that of the reproductive system in mothers, there was no difference between groups.
<RES> Similarly, there were no differences between the combined oestrogen and progestogen group versus placebo for other secondary outcomes reported: low birthweight of less than 2500 g, genital abnormalities in the offspring, abnormalities other than genital tract in the offspring, cancer in the reproductive system in the offspring, or cancer other than of the reproductive system in the offspring.
<RES> The second study was based on pregnant women who had undergone in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).
<RES> This study showed no difference in the rate of miscarriage between the combined oestrogen and progesterone group and the no treatment group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.85).
<RES> The study did not report on this review's other primary outcomes (perinatal death or rates of preterm birth), nor on any of our proposed secondary outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We strongly recommend further research in this area.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pancreas is an organ situated in the abdomen close to the junction of the stomach and small bowel.
<ABS> It secretes digestive juices which are necessary for the digestion of all food materials.
<ABS> The digestive juices secreted in the pancreas drain into the upper part of the small bowel via the pancreatic duct.
<ABS> The bile duct is a tube which drains bile from the liver and gallbladder.
<ABS> The pancreatic and bile ducts share a common path just before they drain into the small bowel.
<ABS> This area is called the periampullary region.
<ABS> Surgical removal is the only potentially curative treatment for cancers arising from the pancreatic and periampullary regions.
<ABS> A considerable proportion of patients undergo unnecessary major open abdominal exploratory operation (laparotomy) because their CT scan has underestimated the spread of cancer.
<ABS> If the cancer is spread within the abdomen during the major open operation, patients are referred for alternate treatments such as chemotherapy which do not cure the cancer but may improve survival.
<ABS> Thus the major open abdominal operation can be avoided if the spread of cancer within the abdomen is known prior to the major operation.
<ABS> This is called 'staging' the cancer.
<ABS> Usually the minimum test used for staging is the CT scan.
<ABS> However, CT scan can understage the cancer, i.e. it can underestimate the spread of cancer.
<ABS> Laparoscopy, a procedure whereby a small telescope is inserted inside the abdomen through a small (keyhole) surgical incision can detect spread not identified on CT scanning.
<ABS> Different studies report different accuracy of laparoscopy in assessing whether the cancer can be removed.
<ABS> In this study, we have identified all such studies and using the appropriate mathematical methods, we have identified the average diagnostic accuracy of laparoscopy for staging pancreatic and periampullary cancers considered to be removable after a CT scan.
<ABS> We included 15 studies with a total of 1015 patients in this study.
<ABS> Of those with what CT suggests seems to be a potentially surgically curable cancer, the percentage of patients in whom more extensive cancer was found on further staging with diagnostic laparoscopy or laparotomy ranged between 17% and 82% across studies.
<ABS> The median percentage of people in whom cancer spread was not detected by CT scan was 40%.
<ABS> Adding staging laparoscopy to CT scan might decrease the number of patients with unremovable disease undergoing unnecessary major operations to 17% compared to those who undergo unnecessary major operation after CT scan alone (40%).
<ABS> This means that using diagnostic laparoscopy could halve the rate of unnecessary major open operations in patients undergoing major surgery for potentially surgically curable pancreatic cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancer.
<INT> A considerable proportion of patients undergo unnecessary laparotomy because of underestimation of the extent of the cancer on computed tomography (CT) scanning.
<INT> Laparoscopy can detect metastases not visualised on CT scanning, enabling better assessment of the spread of cancer (staging of cancer).
<INT> There has been no systematic review or meta-analysis assessing the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in assessing the resectability with curative intent in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We accepted any criteria of resectability used in the studies.
<MaM> We excluded case-control studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently performed data extraction and quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool.
<MaM> The specificity of diagnostic laparoscopy in all studies was 1 because there were no false positives since laparoscopy and the reference standard are one and the same if histological examination after diagnostic laparoscopy is positive.
<MaM> Therefore, the sensitivities were meta-analysed using a univariate random-effects logistic regression model.
<MaM> The probability of unresectability in patients who had a negative laparoscopy (post-test probability for patients with a negative test result) was calculated using the median probability of unresectability (pre-test probability) from the included studies and the negative likelihood ratio derived from the model (specificity of 1 assumed).
<MaM> The difference between the pre-test and post-test probabilities gave the overall added value of diagnostic laparoscopy compared to the standard practice of CT scan staging alone.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifteen studies with a total of 1015 patients were included in the meta-analysis.
<RES> Only one study including 52 patients had a low risk of bias and low applicability concern in the patient selection domain.
<RES> The median pre-test probability of unresectable disease after CT scanning across studies was 40.3% (that is 40 out of 100 patients who had resectable cancer after CT scan were found to have unresectable disease on laparotomy).
<RES> The summary sensitivity of diagnostic laparoscopy was 68.7% (95% CI 54.3% to 80.2%).
<RES> Assuming a pre-test probability of 40.3%, the post-test probability of unresectable disease for patients with a negative test result was 0.17 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.24).
<RES> This indicates that if a patient is said to have resectable disease after diagnostic laparoscopy and CT scan, there is a 17% probability that their cancer will be unresectable compared to a 40% probability for those receiving CT alone.
<RES> A subgroup analysis of patients with pancreatic cancer gave a summary sensitivity of 67.9% (95% CI 41.1% to 86.5%).
<RES> The post-test probability of unresectable disease after being considered resectable on both CT and diagnostic laparoscopy was 18% compared to 40% for those receiving CT alone.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Hurler syndrome or mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a rare genetic disorder that occurs when an enzyme that the body needs is missing or not working well enough.
<ABS> This leads to the build up of a number of complex molecules in certain cells and tissues.
<ABS> If untreated, this results in a classic picture of dwarfism, enlargement of body organs and a reduction in thinking ability.
<ABS> It occurs when a person inherits two copies of the defective gene (one from each parent) and is just as common in males as in females.
<ABS> It classically presents in infancy, however milder versions can present in adulthood.
<ABS> Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase aims to replace the missing enzyme; however, given its high cost, it is essential to assess how effective and safe this treatment is.
<ABS> Current evidence is limited because we only found one randomised clinical trial in the medical literature, which did not include very many patients.
<ABS> Compared with placebo, enzyme replacement therapy improved the patients’ ability to walk, reduced the excretion of abnormal glycosaminoglycans (a type of carbohydrate molecule) in the urine and also reduced the stopping of breathing related to sleep.
<ABS> Enzyme replacement therapy can be used before and around the time of stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment for Hurler syndrome in patients diagnosed before the age of two and a half years.
<ABS> More studies are needed to look at the long-term effects of this treatment and also to see the effects on patients' quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> It is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase.
<INT> Deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the tissues.
<INT> If Hurler syndrome is left untreated, death ensues by adolescence.
<INT> Enzyme replacement therapy has been used for a number of years in the treatment of Hurler syndrome, although the current gold standard would be a haemopoietic stem cell transplant in those diagnosed by 2.5 years of age.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Date of most recent search: 08 February 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened the identified trials.
<MaM> The authors then appraised and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One study of 45 patients met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multinational trial looked at laronidase at a dose of 0.58 mg/kg/week versus placebo in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type I. All primary outcomes listed in this review were studied in this trial.
<RES> The laronidase group achieved statistically significant improvements in per cent predicted forced vital capacity compared to placebo, MD 5.60 (95% confidence intervals 1.24 to 9.96) and in the six-minute-walk test (mean improvement of 38.1 metres in the laronidase group; P = 0.66, when using a prospectively planned analysis of covariance).
<RES> The levels of urinary glycoaminoglycans were also significantly reduced.
<RES> In addition, there were improvements in hepatomegaly, sleep apnoea and hypopnoea.
<RES> Laronidase antibodies were detected in nearly all patients in the treatment group with no apparent clinical effect and titres were reducing by the end of the study.
<RES> Infusion-related adverse reactions occurred in both groups but all were mild and none necessitated medical intervention or infusion cessation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The current evidence demonstrates that laronidase is effective when compared to placebo in the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type I. The included trial was comprehensive and of good quality, although there were few participants.
<CON> The trial included all of the key outcome measures we wished to look at.
<CON> In addition glycosaminoglycan storage was reduced as ascertained by a reduction in liver volume.
<CON> Laronidase appeared to be safe and, while antibodies were generated, these titres were reducing by the end of the study.
<CON> More studies are required to determine long-term effectiveness and safety and to assess the impact upon quality of life.
<CON> Enzyme replacement therapy with laronidase can be used pre- and peri-haemopoietic stem cell transplant, which is now the gold standard treatment in those patients diagnosed under 2.5 years of age.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review investigated the effectiveness of zinc supplementation for preventing illness and mortality, and for promoting growth, in children between six months and 12 years of age.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Zinc is an essential micronutrient and zinc deficiency is an important public health problem in low- and middle-income countries.
<ABS> Zinc deficiency impairs growth and contributes to numerous child deaths per year due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria.
<ABS> This review aimed to determine if giving children zinc supplements would help prevent child death, disease, and growth deficits.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched a wide range of electronic databases for studies that randomly assigned children aged six months to 12 years to either zinc supplementation or a control group that did not receive zinc.
<ABS> Eighty randomised studies with 205,401 eligible participants were included in this review.
<ABS> The evidence is current to December 2012.
<ABS> Key results and the quality of the evidence
<ABS> Giving children zinc supplements might reduce their risk of death in general, and their risk of death due to diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), or malaria.
<ABS> The quality of evidence for overall mortality was high, though evidence for other critical outcomes was only moderate.
<ABS> Children given zinc experience less diarrhoeal disease than children not given zinc; however, zinc does not seem to reduce children's risk of respiratory infection or malaria.
<ABS> Zinc supplementation may have a very small effect on growth, but eating more calories would probably have a larger effect for many malnourished children.
<ABS> Children who take zinc supplements may experience vomiting as a side effect.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Zinc deficiency also impairs growth.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of preventive zinc supplementation in children aged six months to 12 years compared with no intervention, a placebo, or a waiting list control.
<MaM> We excluded hospitalised children and children with chronic diseases or conditions.
<MaM> We excluded food fortification or intake, sprinkles, and therapeutic interventions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> We contacted trial authors for missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 80 randomised controlled trials with 205,401 eligible participants.
<RES> We did not consider that the evidence for the key analyses of morbidity and mortality outcomes were affected by risk of bias.
<RES> The risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality was compatible with a reduction and a small increased risk of death with zinc supplementation (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 14 studies, high-quality evidence), and also for cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31, four studies, moderate-quality evidence), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15, three studies, moderate-quality evidence), or malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06, two studies, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Supplementation reduced diarrhoea morbidity, including the incidence of all-cause diarrhoea (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.89, 26 studies, moderate-quality evidence), but the results for LRTI and malaria were imprecise: LRTI (RR 1, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07, 12 studies, moderate-quality evidence); malaria (RR 1.05, 95% 0.95 to 1.15, four studies, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence of a very small improvement in height with supplementation (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.06; 50 studies), but the size of this effect might not be clinically important.
<RES> There was a medium to large positive effect on zinc status.
<RES> Supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.46, five studies, high-quality evidence).
<RES> We found no clear evidence of benefit or harm of supplementation with regard to haemoglobin or iron status.
<RES> Supplementation had a negative effect on copper status.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In our opinion, the benefits of preventive zinc supplementation outweigh the harms in areas where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high.
<CON> Further research should determine optimal intervention characteristics such as supplement dose.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised of two disorders: ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
<ABS> These disorders have both distinct and overlapping symptoms, but the underlying cause remains incompletely understood.
<ABS> Standard therapy for IBD includes sulfasalazine, 5-ASA drugs, steroids, immunosuppressives such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and biological agents such as infliximab.
<ABS> Helminths are worm-like parasites, that inhabit larger organisms.
<ABS> Helminths cause changes in the immune systems of their hosts including an altered immunological response to antigens and this has implications for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease which is thought to be caused by immune dysregulation.
<ABS> The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and safety of helminth therapy for inducing remission in people with IBD.
<ABS> This review identified two randomised controlled trials including a total of 90 participants.
<ABS> One study compared twice weekly treatment with helminths (an 0.8 mL solution containing 2500 live eggs of the helminth Trichuris suis) for 12 weeks to a matching placebo (an 0.8 ml identical looking solution with no Trichuris suis eggs) in 54 patients with active ulcerative colitis.
<ABS> Few remissions occurred during the trial and helminth treatment had no detectable effect on these remissions.
<ABS> Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the helminth group achieved remission compared to four per cent (1/24) of placebo patients.
<ABS> A higher proportion of patients in the helminth group (43% or 13/30) improved clinically compared to the placebo group (17% or 4/24).
<ABS> However, this difference could be a chance effect.
<ABS> We could not determine whether the proportion of patients who had a side effect was higher in either group.
<ABS> No observed side effects were thought to be related to treatment were reported in this study.
<ABS> The other study compared one treatment with various doses of helminths (a solution of 500, 2500 or 7500 Trichuris suis eggs) to a matching placebo in 36 patients with Crohn's disease.
<ABS> This study was designed to assess side effects and did not measure clinical remission or improvement.
<ABS> There amount of information available on side-effects at two weeks was limited and the results were uncertain due to the small number of participants in the study.
<ABS> The only side effect that was judged to be possibly related to the study treatment was dysgeusia (a distortion of the sense of taste).
<ABS> This was reported in one patient in the helminth group and in one patient in the placebo group.
<ABS> Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness and safety of helminths used to treat patients with IBD.
<ABS> The only information available relating to clinical improvement in patients with active ulcerative colitis comes from one small study.
<ABS> We do not know how safe helminths are when used in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
<ABS> Further randomised controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of helminth therapy in IBD.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, globally-occurring gastrointestinal disorder and a major cause of illness and disability.
<INT> It is conventionally classified into Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
<INT> Helminths are parasitic worms with complex life cycles involving tissue- or lumen-dwelling stages in their hosts, and causing long-lasting or chronic infections that are frequently asymptomatic.
<INT> Helminths modulate immune responses of their hosts, and many observational and experimental studies support the hypothesis that helminths suppress immune-mediated chronic inflammation that occurs in asthma, allergy and IBD.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases from inception to 13 July 2013: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Group Specialized Trials Register.
<MaM> We also searched four online trials registries, and abstracts from major meetings.
<MaM> There were no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed eligibility using a standardized data collection form.
<MaM> We used the RevMan software for analyses.
<MaM> The primary outcome was induction of remission as defined by the included studies.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included clinical, histologic, or endoscopic improvement as defined by the authors, endoscopic mucosal healing, change in disease activity index score, change in quality of life score, hospital admissions, requirement for intravenous corticosteroids, surgery, study withdrawal and the incidence of adverse events.
<MaM> We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.
<MaM> We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.
<MaM> We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two RCTs (90 participants) were included.
<RES> One trial assessed the efficacy and safety of Trichuris suis (T. suis) ova in patients with UC (n = 54).
<RES> The other RCT was a phase one that assessed the safety and tolerability of T. suis ova in patients with CD (n = 36).
<RES> The risk of bias in both studies was judged to be low.
<RES> In the UC study, during the 12-week study period, participants in the active arm received 2-weekly aliquots of 2500 T. suis eggs, added to 0.8 mL of saline; those in the placebo arm received 0.8 mL saline only.
<RES> There were sparse data available for the outcomes clinical remission and clinical improvement.
<RES> Ten per cent (3/30) of patients in the T. suis arm entered remission compared to 4% (1/24) of patients in the placebo arm (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 21.63).
<RES> Forty-three per cent (13/30) of patients in the T. suis group achieved clinical improvement compared to 17% (4/24) of placebo patients (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.95).
<RES> The mean ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) score was lower in the T. suis group (6.1 +/- 0.61) compared to the placebo group (7.5 +/- 0.66) after 12 weeks of treatment (MD -1.40, 95% CI -1.75 to -1.05).
<RES> There was only limited evidence relating to the proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event.
<RES> Three per cent (1/30) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 12% (3/24) of placebo patients (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.40).
<RES> None of the adverse events reported in this study were judged to be related to the study treatment.
<RES> GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission and improvement) as low due to serious imprecision.
<RES> In the CD study, participants received a single treatment of T. suis ova at a dosage of 500 (n = 9), 2500 (n = 9), or 7500 (n = 9) embryonated eggs or matching placebo (n = 9).
<RES> The CD study did not assess clinical remission or improvement as outcomes.
<RES> There were sparse data on adverse events at two weeks.
<RES> Thirty-seven per cent (10/27) of patients in the T. suis group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 44% (4/9) of placebo patients (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.01).
<RES> Only one adverse event (dysgeusia) was judged to be possibly related to treatment in this study.
<RES> Dysgeusia was reported in one patient in the T. suis group and in one patient in the placebo group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of helminths used to treat patients with IBD.
<CON> The evidence for our primary efficacy outcomes in this review comes from one small study and is of low quality due to serious imprecision.
<CON> We do not have enough evidence to determine whether helminths are safe when used in patients with UC and CD.
<CON> Further RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of helminth therapy in IBD.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Lung transplantation is an available and realistic treatment option for patients with cystic fibrosis whose lungs are severely damaged.
<ABS> However, as a natural defence mechanism, the body recognises a transplanted lung as foreign and activates the immune system to reject it.
<ABS> This is known as graft rejection.
<ABS> To prevent this, drugs are needed to suppress the immune system after lung transplantation.
<ABS> There are several different types of such drugs that act by suppressing different components of the immune system.
<ABS> Much of the research on such drugs has focused on all patients after lung transplantation, and not specifically on patients with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> Currently, clinicians do not all agree on a common way of using such drugs in patients with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation.
<ABS> Although we found two eligible studies, they included patients with a number of chronic conditions and not just cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> The results were given for all patients and we were unable to extract results that were specific to patients with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> We contacted the researchers who conducted these randomised studies, but they have not yet sent us the results that were specific to patients with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> We will include these results in future updates of this systematic review, if we receive them.
<ABS> A review of drugs to suppress the immune systems of lung transplant patients in general (not restricted to those with cystic fibrosis) only included three studies which had a high risk of bias.
<ABS> The review did not find that any one drug was better than another for reducing the chances of death or acute rejection; but tacrolimus led to a lower risk of long-term rejection and high blood pressure, although there was a higher risk of diabetes.
<ABS> Research is needed on the use of drugs that suppress the immune system in patients with cystic fibrosis who have received a lung transplantation.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> For patients with cystic fibrosis and advanced pulmonary damage, lung transplantation is an available and viable option.
<INT> However, graft rejection is an important potential consequence after lung transplantation.
<INT> Immunosuppressive therapy is needed to prevent episodes of graft rejection and thus subsequently reduce morbidity and mortality in this population.
<INT> There are a number of classes of immunosuppressive drugs which act on different components of the immune system.
<INT> There is considerable variability in the use of immunosuppressive agents after lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register and scanned references of the potentially eligible study.
<MaM> We also searched the www.clinicaltrials.gov trials registry to obtain information on unpublished and ongoing studies.
<MaM> Date of latest search: 22 August 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We independently assessed the studies identified from our searches for inclusion in the review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our attempts to obtain this information have not yet been successful.
<RES> We will include any provided data in future updates of the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The lack of currently available evidence makes it impossible to make conclusions about the comparative efficacy and safety of the various immunosuppressive drugs among patients with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation.
<CON> A recent Cochrane review comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine in all patients with lung transplantation (not restricted to patients with cystic fibrosis) reported no significant difference in mortality and risk of acute rejection.
<CON> However, tacrolimus use was associated with lower risk of broncholitis obliterans syndrome and arterial hypertension and higher risk of diabetes mellitus.
<CON> It should be noted that this review contained only a small number of included studies (n = 3) with a high risk of bias.
<CON> Additional randomised studies are required to provide evidence for the benefit and safety of the use of immunosuppressive therapy among patients with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory (lung), disabling disease which affects a lot of people worldwide and causes millions of deaths every year.
<ABS> People with COPD suffer differing levels of impairment, daily complaints/symptoms and number of exacerbations.
<ABS> Different health care providers, such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, typically provide different components of care (for example medication, self management and education, exercise training) to people with COPD.
<ABS> The aim of an integrated disease management (IDM) program is to establish a program of different components of care in which different health care providers are co-operating and collaborating to provide efficient and good quality care.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wished to determine the effect of such a program on quality of life, exercise tolerance and the number of exacerbations.
<ABS> We have chosen these outcomes as they are most important for people with COPD.
<ABS> What we found
<ABS> We evaluated 26 studies in 2997 people with COPD.
<ABS> Overall the evidence found was of high to moderate quality.
<ABS> The trials were conducted in 11 different countries.
<ABS> The average age of participants was 68 years, 68% of participants were men and the severity of COPD on average was severe (according to lung function measures).
<ABS> Some of the trials took place in GP clinics and some in hospitals.
<ABS> Overall, the studies were of good to moderate methodological quality.
<ABS> People who participated in an IDM program had better quality of life and improved their exercise tolerance after 12 months.
<ABS> Furthermore, in participants treated with such a program, the number of hospital admissions related to exacerbations decreased and the total number of hospital days was reduced by three days.
<ABS> We found no evidence of an effect on mortality.
<ABS> The results support an IDM program for people with COPD to optimize quality of life and exercise tolerance.
<ABS> This plain language summary is up-to-date as of April 2012.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomized controlled trials evaluating IDM programs for COPD compared with controls were included.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data; if required, we contacted authors for additional data.
<MaM> We performed meta-analyses using random-effects modeling.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 26 trials involving 2997 people were included, with a follow-up ranging from 3 to 24 months.
<RES> Studies were conducted in 11 different countries.
<RES> The mean age of the included participants was 68 years, 68% were male and the mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)% predicted value was 44.3% (range 28% to 66%).
<RES> Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings: primary (n = 8), secondary (n = 12), tertiary care (n = 1), and in both primary and secondary care (n = 5).
<RES> Overall, the studies were of high to moderate methodological quality.
<RES> Compared with controls, IDM showed a statistically and clinically significant improvement in disease-specific QoL on all domains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire after 12 months: dyspnea (mean difference (MD) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.36); fatigue (MD 0.82; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.17); emotional (MD 0.61; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.95) and mastery (MD 0.75; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12).
<RES> The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) for QoL reached the clinically relevant difference of four units only for the impact domain (MD -4.04; 95% CI -5.96 to -2.11, P < 0.0001).
<RES> IDM showed a significantly improved disease-specific QoL on the activity domain of the SGRQ: MD -2.70 (95% CI -4.84 to -0.55, P = 0.01).
<RES> There was no significant difference on the symptom domain of the SGRQ: MD -2.39 (95% CI -5.31 to 0.53, P = 0.11).
<RES> According to the GRADE approach, quality of evidence on the SGRQ was scored as high quality, and on the CRQ as moderate quality evidence.
<RES> Participants treated with an IDM program had a clinically relevant improvement in six-minute walking distance of 43.86 meters compared with controls after 12 months (95% CI 21.83 to 65.89; P < 0.001, moderate quality).
<RES> There was a reduction in the number of participants with one or more hospital admissions over three to 12 months from 27 per 100 participants in the control group to 20 (95% CI 15 to 27) per 100 participants in the IDM group (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.99, P = 0.04; number needed to treat = 15).
<RES> Hospitalization days were significantly lower in the IDM group compared with controls after 12 months (MD -3.78 days; 95% CI -5.90 to -1.67, P < 0.001).
<RES> Admissions and hospital days were graded as high quality evidence.
<RES> No adverse effects were reported in the intervention group.
<RES> No difference between groups was found on mortality (OR 0.96; 95%CI 0.52 to 1.74).
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to refute or confirm the long term effectiveness of IDM.

<H1> Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Topical anti-inflammatory agents for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face or scalp

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Seborrhoeic dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin that most often affects areas of the body that have a lot of sebaceous glands.
<ABS> These include the skin of the scalp; face; chest; and flexure areas such as the armpits, groin, and abdominal folds.
<ABS> The most typical symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis are scaling of the skin and reddish patches.
<ABS> Seborrhoeic dermatitis is fairly common: one to three in 100 people have seborrhoeic dermatitis.
<ABS> The disease is more common in men than in women.
<ABS> Anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antikeratolytic treatments can be used to treat seborrhoeic dermatitis.
<ABS> The treatment does not cure the disease but relieves the symptoms.
<ABS> We included 36 randomised controlled trials with 2706 participants, examining the effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on seborrhoeic dermatitis.
<ABS> These trials were short-term; most of them lasting four weeks or less.
<ABS> Topical steroid treatment (such as hydrocortisone and betamethasone), topical calcineurin inhibitor treatment (such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), and topical lithium salts all reduced the symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis when compared with placebo treatment.
<ABS> Mild (such as hydrocortisone 1%) and strong (such as betamethasone) steroid compounds were comparable in short-term follow up.
<ABS> Short-term total clearance was achieved with antifungal azole treatment (such as ketoconazole and miconazole), as well as with steroids.
<ABS> Strong steroids were better than azole treatment in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus, and were comparable in terms of safety.
<ABS> Steroids were also as effective as calcineurin inhibitors, but side-effects occurred more often with calcineurin inhibitors.
<ABS> We found no differences between calcineurin inhibitors and azole treatments in effectiveness or side-effects.
<ABS> Lithium was more effective than azoles but had a similar frequency of side-effects (one study).
<ABS> The most common side-effects were burning, itching, erythema, and dryness in all treatment groups.
<ABS> Topical anti-inflammatory agents are useful in treating seborrhoeic dermatitis.
<ABS> Steroids are the most investigated anti-inflammatories.
<ABS> We still do not know the effects and safety of topical anti-inflammatory treatments in long-term or continuous use.
<ABS> This is regrettable as the disease is chronic in nature.
<ABS> Furthermore, there are no data concerning the effects of different treatments on quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Current treatment options include antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and keratolytic agents, as well as phototherapy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases up to September 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), and the GREAT database.
<MaM> We searched five trials databases and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Pairs of authors independently assessed eligibility for inclusion, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias.
<MaM> We performed meta-analyses if feasible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 36 RCTs (2706 participants), of which 31 examined topical steroids; seven, calcineurin inhibitors; and three, lithium salts.
<RES> The comparative interventions included placebo, azoles, calcipotriol, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound, and zinc, as well as different anti-inflammatory treatments compared against each other.
<RES> Our outcomes of interest were total clearance of symptoms, erythema, scaling or pruritus scores, and adverse effects.
<RES> The risk of bias in studies was most frequently classified as unclear, due to unclear reporting of methods.
<RES> Steroid treatment resulted in total clearance more often than placebo in short-term trials (four weeks or less) (relative risk (RR) 3.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 11.56, three RCTs, 313 participants) and in one long-term trial (lasting 12 weeks).
<RES> Steroids were also more effective in reducing erythema, scaling, and pruritus.
<RES> Adverse effects were similar in both groups.
<RES> There may be no difference between steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in total clearance in the short-term (RR 1.08, 95% 0.88 to 1.32, two RCTs, 60 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> Steroids and calcineurin inhibitors were found comparable in all other assessed efficacy outcomes as well (five RCTs, 237 participants).
<RES> Adverse events were less common in the steroid group compared with the calcineurin group in the short-term (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.89, two RCTs, 60 participants).
<RES> There were comparable rates of total clearance in the steroid and azole groups (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32, eight RCTs, 464 participants, moderate-quality evidence) as well as of adverse effects in the short-term, but less erythema or scaling with steroids.
<RES> We found mild (class I and II) and strong (class III and IV) steroids comparable in the assessed outcomes, including adverse events.
<RES> The only exception was total clearance in long-term use, which occurred more often with a mild steroid (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98, one RCT, 117 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> In one study, calcineurin inhibitor was more effective than placebo in reducing erythema and scaling, but there were similar rates in total clearance or adverse events for short-term treatment.
<RES> In another study, calcineurin inhibitor was comparable with azole when erythema, scaling, or adverse effects were measured for longer-term treatment.
<RES> Lithium was more effective than placebo with regard to total clearance (RR 8.59, 95% CI 2.08 to 35.52, one RCT, 129 participants) with a comparable safety profile.
<RES> Compared with azole, lithium resulted in total clearance more often (RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.90 in short-term treatment, one RCT, 288 participants, low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Topical steroids are an effective treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis of the face and scalp in adolescents and adults, with no differences between mild and strong steroids in the short-term.
<CON> There is some evidence of the benefit of topical calcineurin inhibitor or lithium salt treatment.
<CON> Treatment with azoles seems as effective as steroids concerning short-term total clearance, but in other outcomes, strong steroids were more effective.
<CON> Calcineurin inhibitor and azole treatment appeared comparable.
<CON> Lithium salts were more effective than azoles in producing total clearance.
<CON> Steroids are similarly effective to calcineurin inhibitors but with less adverse effects.
<CON> Most of the included studies were small and short, lasting four weeks or less.
<CON> Future trials should be appropriately blinded; include more than 200 to 300 participants; and compare steroids to calcineurin inhibitors or lithium salts, and calcineurin inhibitors to azoles or lithium salts.
<CON> The follow-up time should be at least one year, and quality of life should be addressed.
<CON> There is also a need for the development of well-validated outcome measures.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Physical activity refers to any movement of the body generated by the muscles and which burns energy.
<ABS> Physical activity includes exercise, but also includes activity as a part of work, chores or transport.
<ABS> Participation in regular physical activity is important for health and well-being.
<ABS> For most people with cystic fibrosis, physical activity and exercise are routinely recommended, but participation in prescribed programmes is often poor.
<ABS> The best way to encourage people with cystic fibrosis to do more physical activity during their day is unclear.
<ABS> This review aimed to evaluate the strategies that encourage people with cystic fibrosis to participate in daily physical activity.
<ABS> There were four included studies with a total of 199 participants which investigated the effect of exercise training on participation in physical activity.
<ABS> These were mostly conducted in children.
<ABS> The study methods and results were not clearly reported, so it was difficult to tell if the results were influenced by the way in which participants were assessed, or the nature of the outcomes reported.
<ABS> The training programmes ranged from 18 days to three years.
<ABS> In two studies the exercise training programmes were supervised and in two studies they were unsupervised and home-based.
<ABS> Due to differences in the study design and the outcomes measured, we could not combine data from different studies.
<ABS> None of the studies reported any improvement in participation in physical activity when the exercise training lasted less than six months.
<ABS> There was very limited evidence that using a home-exercise programme, for at least six months after receiving activity counselling and exercise advice, improved participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> No training program showed significant effects on quality of life.
<ABS> It is unknown whether strategies such as health coaching or Internet-based advice may help promote regular participation in physical activity in people with cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register using the terms 'physiotherapy and exercise'.
<MaM> Date of the most recent search: 05 December 2013.
<MaM> Additionally, we conducted searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL (Ebscohost), PsycINFO (OvidSP) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro).
<MaM> We also searched for potentially relevant, completed but unpublished studies, on several clinical trials registers.
<MaM> Date of the most recent searches: 10 September 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> Any disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus, or in arbitration with a third author.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies (199 participants) met the inclusion criteria and were predominantly conducted in children with cystic fibrosis.
<RES> Only one study had a combined cohort of adult and paediatric participants.
<RES> The description of study methods was inadequate to assess the risk of bias, particularly with regard to blinding of assessors and selective reporting.
<RES> One study was conducted in an inpatient setting with follow up in the outpatient setting; while the remaining three studies were conducted in individuals with stable respiratory disease in the outpatient setting.
<RES> All included studies used exercise training to promote participation in physical activity, with the duration of the intervention period ranging from 18 days to three years.
<RES> No improvement in physical activity participation was reported with any intervention period less than or equal to six months.
<RES> Improvements in physical activity participation were only seen where follow up occurred beyond 12 months.
<RES> There was no significant impact on quality of life from any of the intervention strategies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Although participation in physical activity is generally regarded as beneficial for people with cystic fibrosis, there is a lack of evidence regarding strategies to promote the uptake and the continued participation in physical activity for this population.
<CON> This review provides very limited evidence that activity counselling and exercise advice, undertaken over at least six months, to engage in a home exercise programme may result in improved physical activity participation in people with cystic fibrosis.
<CON> Further research is needed to determine the effect of strategies such as health coaching or telemedicine applications, in promoting the uptake and adherence to regular participation in physical activity.
<CON> In addition, establishing the ideal duration of any interventions that promote physical activity, including exercise training programmes, will be important in addressing issues relating to participation in physical activity for people with cystic fibrosis.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Migraine is a complex condition with a wide variety of symptoms.
<ABS> For many people the main feature is a painful headache.
<ABS> Other symptoms include feeling sick, vomiting, disturbed vision, and sensitivity to light, sound, and smells.
<ABS> Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat migraine headaches.
<ABS> One NSAID is naproxen.
<ABS> On 22 May 2013, we looked for clinical trials where naproxen was used to treat migraine headache.
<ABS> We found six good quality studies with about 2700 people.
<ABS> Naproxen was more effective than placebo for relieving migraine headache in adults, but only weakly so.
<ABS> From having headache pain described as moderate or severe, about 2 in 10 people (17%) were pain-free at two hours when treated with naproxen.
<ABS> However, about 1 in 10 (8%) were pain-free at two hours when treated with placebo.
<ABS> Almost 5 in 10 had some headache relief with naproxen, and 3 in 10 with placebo.
<ABS> Naproxen is not as good as some other medicines such as ibuprofen or sumatriptan.
<ABS> More dizziness, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), sleepiness (somnolence), nausea, indigestion (dyspepsia), dry mouth, and abdominal discomfort were reported with the 825 mg dose.
<ABS> These effects were generally of mild to moderate severity and rarely led to withdrawal from the studies.
<ABS> Naproxen is not a good drug for treating migraine at the doses of 500 mg or 825 mg used in the studies we found.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society.
<INT> Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); its efficacy in acute migraine has not been established by systematic reviews.
<INT> Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included six studies using naproxen 275 mg, 500 mg, or 825 mg to treat attacks of moderate or severe pain intensity.
<RES> Overall, 1241 participants took naproxen (275 mg to 825 mg), 229 took sumatriptan 50 mg, 173 took naratriptan 2.5 mg, and 1092 took placebo.
<RES> No studies combined naproxen with an antiemetic.
<RES> Studies using naproxen 275 mg provided no useable data for analysis.
<RES> Naproxen (500 mg and 825 mg) was better than placebo for pain-free response and headache relief.
<RES> At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 11 (17% response with naproxen, 8% with placebo; risk ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.6), moderate quality) and for headache relief was 6.0 (45% response with naproxen, 29% with placebo; risk ratio 1.6 (1.4 to 1.8), moderate quality).
<RES> The NNT for sustained pain-free response during the 24 hours post dose was 19 (12% response with naproxen, 6.7% with placebo), and for sustained headache relief during the 24 hours post dose was 8.3 (30% response with naproxen, 18% with placebo).
<RES> Analysing only the lower dose of 500 mg of naproxen did not significantly change the results.
<RES> Adverse events, which were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal, were more common with naproxen than with placebo when the 500 mg and 825 mg doses were considered together, but not when the 500 mg dose was analysed alone.
<RES> There were insufficient data for analysis of naproxen compared with sumatriptan, and no data suitable for analysis of naproxen compared with naratriptan.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Naproxen is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 11 for pain-free response at two hours
<CON> suggests that it is not a clinically useful treatment.
<CON> Cochrane reviews examining other commonly used analgesics for acute migraine have reported better (lower) NNT results for the same outcome.
<CON> Naproxen is not clinically useful as a stand-alone analgesic in acute migraine, as it is effective in fewer than 2 people in 10.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: effects on growth

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question: We reviewed the evidence on whether inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) could affect growth in children with persistent asthma, that is, a more severe asthma that requires regular use of medications for control of symptoms.
<ABS> Background: Treatment guidelines for asthma recommend ICS as first-line therapy for children with persistent asthma.
<ABS> Although ICS treatment is generally considered safe in children, parents and physicians always remain concerned about the potential negative effect of ICS on growth.
<ABS> Search date: We searched trials published until January 2014.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included in this review trials comparing daily use of corticosteroids, delivered by any type of inhalation device for at least three months, versus placebo or non-steroidal drugs in children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma.
<ABS> Key results: Twenty-five trials involving 8471 children with mild to moderate persistent asthma (5128 treated with ICS and 3343 treated with placebo or non-steroidal drugs) were included in this review.
<ABS> Eighty percent of these trials were conducted in more than two different centres and were called multi-centre studies; five were international multi-centre studies conducted in high-income and low-income countries across Africa, Asia-Pacifica, Europe and the Americas.
<ABS> Sixty-eight percent were financially supported by pharmaceutical companies.
<ABS> Meta-analysis (a statistical technique that combines the results of several studies and provides a high level of evidence) suggests that children treated daily with ICS may grow approximately half a centimeter per year less than those not treated with these medications during the first year of treatment.
<ABS> The magnitude of ICS-related growth reduction may depend on the type of drug.
<ABS> Growth reduction seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment.
<ABS> Evidence provided by this review allows us to conclude that daily use of ICS can cause a small reduction in height in children up to 18 years of age with persistent asthma; this effect seems minor compared with the known benefit of these medications for asthma control.
<ABS> Quality of evidence: Eleven of 25 trials did not report how they guaranteed that participants had an equal chance of receiving ICS or placebo or non-steroidal drugs.
<ABS> All but six trials did not report how researchers were kept unaware of the treatment assignment list.
<ABS> However, this methodological limitation may not significantly affect the quality of evidence because the results remained almost unchanged when we excluded these trials from the analysis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Treatment guidelines for asthma recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as first-line therapy for children with persistent asthma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also conducted a search of ClinicalTrials.gov and manufacturers' clinical trial databases to look for potential relevant unpublished studies.
<MaM> The literature search was conducted in January 2014.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies.
<MaM> We conducted meta-analyses using the Cochrane statistical package RevMan 5.2 and Stata version 11.0.
<MaM> We used the random-effects model for meta-analyses.
<MaM> We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs as the metrics for treatment effects.
<MaM> A negative value for MD indicates that ICS have suppressive effects on linear growth compared with controls.
<MaM> We performed a priori planned subgroup analyses to explore potential effect modifiers, such as ICS molecule, daily dose, inhalation device and age of the treated child.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 25 trials involving 8471 (5128 ICS-treated and 3343 control) children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.
<RES> Six molecules (beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, ciclesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate and mometasone fumarate) given at low or medium daily doses were used during a period of three months to four to six years.
<RES> Most trials were blinded and over half of the trials had drop out rates of over 20%.
<RES> Compared with placebo or non-steroidal drugs, ICS produced a statistically significant reduction in linear growth velocity (14 trials with 5717 participants, MD -0.48 cm/y, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.30, moderate quality evidence) and in the change from baseline in height (15 trials with 3275 participants; MD -0.61 cm/y, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.38, moderate quality evidence) during a one-year treatment period.
<RES> Subgroup analysis showed a statistically significant group difference between six molecules in the mean reduction of linear growth velocity during one-year treatment (Chi² = 26.1, degrees of freedom (df) = 5, P value < 0.0001).
<RES> The group difference persisted even when analysis was restricted to the trials using doses equivalent to 200 μg/d hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-beclomethasone.
<RES> Subgroup analyses did not show a statistically significant impact of daily dose (low vs medium), inhalation device or participant age on the magnitude of ICS-induced suppression of linear growth velocity during a one-year treatment period.
<RES> However, head-to-head comparisons are needed to assess the effects of different drug molecules, dose, inhalation device or patient age.
<RES> No statistically significant difference in linear growth velocity was found between participants treated with ICS and controls during the second year of treatment (five trials with 3174 participants; MD -0.19 cm/y, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.11, P value 0.22).
<RES> Of two trials that reported linear growth velocity in the third year of treatment, one trial involving 667 participants showed similar growth velocity between the budesonide and placebo groups (5.34 cm/y vs 5.34 cm/y), and another trial involving 1974 participants showed lower growth velocity in the budesonide group compared with the placebo group (MD -0.33 cm/y, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.14, P value 0.0005).
<RES> Among four trials reporting data on linear growth after treatment cessation, three did not describe statistically significant catch-up growth in the ICS group two to four months after treatment cessation.
<RES> One trial showed accelerated linear growth velocity in the fluticasone group at 12 months after treatment cessation, but there remained a statistically significant difference of 0.7 cm in height between the fluticasone and placebo groups at the end of the three-year trial.
<RES> One trial with follow-up into adulthood showed that participants of prepubertal age treated with budesonide 400 μg/d for a mean duration of 4.3 years had a mean reduction of 1.20 cm (95% CI -1.90 to -0.50) in adult height compared with those treated with placebo.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Regular use of ICS at low or medium daily doses is associated with a mean reduction of 0.48 cm/y in linear growth velocity and a 0.61-cm change from baseline in height during a one-year treatment period in children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.
<CON> The effect size of ICS on linear growth velocity appears to be associated more strongly with the ICS molecule than with the device or dose (low to medium dose range).
<CON> ICS-induced growth suppression seems to be maximal during the first year of therapy and less pronounced in subsequent years of treatment.
<CON> However, additional studies are needed to better characterise the molecule dependency of growth suppression, particularly with newer molecules (mometasone, ciclesonide), to specify the respective role of molecule, daily dose, inhalation device and patient age on the effect size of ICS, and to define the growth suppression effect of ICS treatment over a period of several years in children with persistent asthma.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Psoriasis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disease, with an estimated global prevalence ranging from 0.5% to 4.6%.
<ABS> Based on clinical features, psoriasis is generally divided into the following: chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP); psoriasis associated with psoriatic arthritis; and pustular, erythrodermic, or guttate psoriasis.
<ABS> We also considered psoriasis affecting the palms and soles (palmoplantar psoriasis, or PPP).
<ABS> Although psoriasis is rarely life-threatening, it can affect a person's quality of life significantly.
<ABS> Phototherapy is an essential treatment option for people with psoriasis.
<ABS> The most commonly used types of phototherapy are narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB), broad-band ultraviolet B (BB-UVB), and psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA).
<ABS> PUVA can be further divided into oral, bath, and topical PUVA according to the administrative route of psoralen.
<ABS> NB-UVB delivers almost exclusively 311 nm radiation, whereas BB-UVB can be divided into two types: selective BB-UVB (305 to 325 nm radiation) and conventional BB-UVB (280 to 320 nm radiation).
<ABS> This review included 13 small randomised controlled trials (RCT), with a total of 662 participants.
<ABS> Most of these were of poor methodological quality.
<ABS> For treating CPP, the clearance rate between the NB-UVB and oral PUVA groups were inconsistent in three RCTs.
<ABS> In one, there was no difference between the groups, and in the other two, the clearance rate was in favour of oral PUVA.
<ABS> The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the two groups, while another RCT favoured bath PUVA.
<ABS> Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or guttate psoriasis.
<ABS> One RCT found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP or in the number of withdrawals due to side-effects.
<ABS> In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no statistically significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate.
<ABS> In summary, NB-UVB may be preferred to oral or bath PUVA because it is more convenient to use.
<ABS> NB-UVB seemed to be equal to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP.
<ABS> Evidence regarding NB-UVB and conventional BB-UVB is limited.
<ABS> The long-term safety of NB-UVB needs to be confirmed.
<ABS> The efficacy of NB-UVB for clearing PPP needs to be confirmed in future studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There is substantial controversy regarding their efficacy when compared with each other.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases up to August 2013: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (from 1946), and EMBASE (from 1974).
<MaM> We searched the following databases up to November 2012: CNKI (from 1974) and CBM (from 1978).
<MaM> We also searched trials registers and the OpenGrey database.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 662 participants.
<RES> We report the results of intention-to-treat analyses (ITT) here.
<RES> Our primary outcomes of interest were as follows: Participant-rated global improvement, Percentage of participants reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (which meant equal to or more than 75% reduction in PASI score), Withdrawal due to side-effects, and Clearance rate.
<RES> In one RCT of NB-UVB compared with oral PUVA in participants with CPP, the difference in PASI 75 was not statistically significant (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.32; N = 51; low quality).
<RES> In three other RCTs of CPP, the clearance rates were inconsistent because in one, there was no difference between the groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; N = 54), and in the other two, the clearance rates were statistically significantly in favour of oral PUVA: RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.93; N = 93 and RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; N = 100, respectively.
<RES> Pooled data from these three studies indicated that withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different between either group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.54; N = 247; low quality).
<RES> The evidence from the comparison of NB-UVB with bath PUVA in terms of clearance rate for CPP was also inconsistent: Pooled data from two left-right body comparison RCTs found no significant difference between the NB-UVB and bath PUVA groups (RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.91; N = 92; low quality), while a parallel RCT favoured bath PUVA (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.71; N = 36; low quality).
<RES> In participants with PPP, one RCT found there were no significant differences between NB-UVB treated sides and topical PUVA treated sides in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.56; N = 50; low quality).
<RES> Two RCTs found NB-UVB plus retinoid (re-NB-UVB) and PUVA plus retinoid (re-PUVA) had similar effects for treating people with CPP or GP in terms of clearance rate (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.10; N = 90; low quality).
<RES> One RCT in people with CPP found no significant differences between NB-UVB and selective BB-UVB in terms of clearance rate (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.13; N = 100; low quality) and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 27.87; N = 100; low quality).
<RES> No studies reported our primary outcomes for NB-UVB compared with conventional BB-UVB.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Current evidence is very heterogeneous and needs to be interpreted with caution.
<CON> The clearance rate between oral PUVA and NB-UVB is inconsistent among the included studies.
<CON> Evidence regarding NB-UVB versus bath PUVA is also inconsistent.
<CON> Re-NB-UVB and re-PUVA are similarly effective for treating people with CPP or GP.
<CON> In practice, NB-UVB may be more convenient to use since exogenous photosensitiser is not required before phototherapy.
<CON> NB-UVB is considered ineffective for PPP in clinical practice, and a small RCT did not detect a statistically significant difference between NB-UVB and topical PUVA for clearing PPP.
<CON> NB-UVB seemed to be similar to selective BB-UVB for clearing CPP.
<CON> Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the long-term safety of NB-UVB.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A parastomal hernia is defined as an incisional hernia related to a stoma and belongs to the most common stoma-related complications.
<ABS> Many factors concerning the operative technique that are considered to influence the incidence of parastomal herniation have been investigated.
<ABS> However, it remains unclear whether the enterostomy should be placed through or lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle in order to prevent parastomal herniation and other important stoma complications for patients.
<ABS> Nine retrospective cohort studies with a total of 761 participants met the inclusion criteria.
<ABS> All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation), and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse).
<ABS> None of the included studies compared the two interventions with regard to other secondary outcomes.
<ABS> There was neither a significant difference in terms of the risk for parastomal herniation nor with regard to the occurrence of stomal prolapse.
<ABS> In summary, the quality of the identified evidence is too poor to allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review.
<ABS> This highlights the need for randomized trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the lateral pararectal versus the transrectal approach in preventing parastomal herniation and other stoma-related and patient-important morbidity in people requiring enterostomy placement.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A parastomal hernia is defined as an incisional hernia related to a stoma and belongs to the most common stoma-related complications.
<INT> Many factors concerning the operative technique which are considered to influence the incidence of parastomal herniation have been investigated.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the bibliographic databases The Cochrane Library (4 October 2012), MEDLINE (1 October 2012), EMBASE (10 October 2012), LILACS (29 November 2012), and Science Citation Index Expanded (4 October 2012).
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of all relevant studies and the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov (9 October 2012), World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal (10 October 2012), as well as three additional trial registers not included in the ICTRP (27 November 2012).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data.
<MaM> Data analyses were conducted according to the recommendations of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group (CCCG).
<MaM> Quality of evidence was rated according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nine retrospective cohort studies with a total of 761 participants met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> All included studies reported results for the primary outcome (parastomal herniation), and one study also reported data on one of the secondary outcomes (stomal prolapse).
<RES> None of the included studies compared the two interventions with regard to other secondary outcomes.
<RES> There was neither a significant difference in terms of the risk for parastomal herniation (risk ratio (RR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 2.1) nor with regard to the occurrence of stomal prolapse (RR 1.23; 95% CI 0.39 to 3.85).
<RES> An I² value of 65% indicated substantial statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The poor quality of the included evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of the review.
<CON> This review highlights a clear uncertainty as to the relative merits of either approach.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Aromatase inhibitors for uterine fibroids

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Aromatase inhibitors for women with uterine fibroids

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are aromatase Inhibitors safe and effective for treating uterine fibroids?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumours in women of reproductive age.
<ABS> By causing heavy or irregular bleeding, subfertility or pelvic pressure symptoms, uterine fibroids have a major impact on women's health and on their quality of life.
<ABS> Traditional surgical treatments have a high recurrence rate and high risk of postoperative complications (e.g. pain, infertility); therefore, safer and more effective medical therapy has been sought.
<ABS> It has been suggested that aromatase inhibitors may shrink uterine fibroids by blocking the production of oestrogen.
<ABS> A review of the evidence was conducted by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration, who searched in August 2013 for all relevant randomised controlled trials and found only one eligible study.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Only one RCT study, consisting of 70 participants, was found.
<ABS> The study was conducted in teaching hospitals in Iran and Germany.
<ABS> It did not report on changes in fibroid-related symptoms or on the source of study funding.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The review authors concluded that, to date, evidence is insufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness and safety of AI drugs in treating women with uterine fibroids.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Uterine fibroids, also called uterine leiomyomas or myomas, are the most common benign tumours in women of reproductive age.
<INT> Albeit generally benign, uterine ﬁbroids can have a major impact on women's health and quality of life by contributing to abnormal uterine bleeding and causing pelvic pressure symptoms (such as increased urinary frequency, pelvic pain and constipation).
<INT> Traditional treatments for symptomatic ﬁbroids include a variety of surgical techniques.
<INT> However, because of the high recurrence rate, as well as possible pain and infertility caused by the formation of postoperative adhesions, this approach may not be advisable.
<INT> Safer and more effective medical therapy has long been awaited.
<INT> Both in vitro studies and clinical trials have suggested that use of the aromatase inhibitors (AIs), a class of anti-oestrogens, might inhibit ﬁbroid growth, thereby eliminating the need for surgery.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following databases (from inception to August 21, 2013): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO.
<MaM> In addition, the reference lists of included trials were searched, and experts in the field were contacted.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Selection of eligible trials, assessment of trial quality and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors.
<MaM> If data were available, we planned to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for analysis of dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial involving 70 participants was included.
<RES> This trial did not report our primary review outcome (relief of symptoms of fibroids).
<RES> The only secondary review outcomes reported by this trial were adverse effects (hot flushes) and reduction in fibroid size.
<RES> The included trial did not report data on fibroid volume in a form that permitted calcuation of an odds ratio.
<RES> Morevoer it was unblinded and included only 60/70 women in analysis.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Respiratory problems in people with cystic fibrosis are mainly due to repeated lung infections.
<ABS> Culturing sputum samples often allows quick identification of the organism causing the infection and early treatment.
<ABS> If patients (most young children and some adults) can not provide sputum samples, swabs are taken from the upper throat to identify the organism causing the infection in the lower airways – but this may not be the most reliable method.
<ABS> During a bronchoscopy, clinicians examine the lower airways using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and camera at one end; they may also collect mucus.
<ABS> This requires patients to be in hospital and be sedated or have a general anaesthetic.
<ABS> It is not certain if treatment based on bronchoscopy samples is better than that based on throat swabs.
<ABS> We searched for studies of participants of any age, but this review only includes one study in young children.
<ABS> The study randomly assigned 170 babies under six months of age with cystic fibrosis to receive antibiotics for chest infections based on samples taken by either bronchoscopy or from the throat.
<ABS> Outcomes were assessed at five years of age; 157 children completed the study.
<ABS> This study did not show any difference between the groups in lung function, weight, body mass index or in the score calculated by a CT scan of the lungs at five years of age.
<ABS> Additionally, there were no differences in how many children in each group had an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at five years of age, or per year of follow up, or how often a child was unwell with respiratory symptoms.
<ABS> Patients in the bronchoscopy group were admitted to hospital more often than the other group, although admissions were generally shorter.
<ABS> Adverse events reported during, and after bronchoscopy, were not serious and generally well tolerated; the most common was increased coughing (noted in one third of patients).
<ABS> This study was limited because fewer patients were recruited than the study needed.
<ABS> As the treatment of initial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is highly successful, larger and longer studies are needed to detect small differences between the groups.
<ABS> Conducting such large studies is extremely difficult.
<ABS> There is currently not enough evidence to support the regular use of bronchoscopy to diagnose and treat lung infections in young patients with cystic fibrosis.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Early diagnosis and treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, particularly those with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are the mainstay of management of lung disease in cystic fibrosis.
<INT> When sputum samples are unavailable, treatment relies mainly on cultures from oropharyngeal specimens; however, there are concerns regarding the sensitivity of these to identify lower respiratory organisms.
<INT> Bronchoscopy and related procedures (including bronchoalveolar lavage) though invasive, allow the collection of lower respiratory specimens from non-sputum producers.
<INT> Cultures of bronchoscopic specimens provide a higher yield of organisms compared to those from oropharyngeal specimens.
<INT> Regular use of bronchoscopy and related procedures may help in a more accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and guide the selection of antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched two registries of ongoing studies and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.
<MaM> Date of latest search: 28 November 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed their risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study investigators for further information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified nine studies, but only one study with data from 157 participants (170 patients were enrolled) was eligible for inclusion in the review.
<RES> This study compared outcomes following therapy directed by bronchoalveolar lavage for pulmonary exacerbations during the first five years of life with standard treatment based on clinical features and oropharyngeal cultures.
<RES> The study enrolled infants with CF who were under six months of age and diagnosed through newborn screening and followed them until they were five years old.
<RES> We considered this study to have a low risk of bias; however, the statistical power to detect a significant difference in the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was limited due to the prevalence (of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation in bronchoalveolar lavage samples at five years age) being much lower in both the groups compared to that which was expected and which was used for the power calculation.
<RES> The sample size was adequate to detect a difference in high-resolution computed tomography scoring.
<RES> The quality of evidence for the key parameters was graded as moderate except for high-resolution computed tomography scoring, which was graded as high.
<RES> At five years of age, there was no clear benefit of bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy on lung function z scores or nutritional parameters.
<RES> Evaluation of total and component high-resolution computed tomography scores showed no significant difference in evidence of structural lung disease in the two groups.
<RES> In addition, this study did not show any difference between the number of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per child per year diagnosed in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group compared to the standard therapy group.
<RES> The eradication rate following one or two courses of eradication treatment was comparable in the two groups, as were the number of pulmonary exacerbations.
<RES> However, the number of hospitalizations was significantly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage-directed therapy group, but the mean duration of hospitalizations was significantly less compared to the standard therapy group.
<RES> Mild adverse events were reported in a proportion of patients, but these were generally well-tolerated.
<RES> The most common adverse event reported was transient worsening of cough after 29% of procedures.
<RES> Significant clinical deterioration was documented during or within 24 hours of bronchoalveolar lavage in 4.8% of procedures.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No evidence was available for adult and adolescent populations.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Collaborative care aims to improve the physical and mental health of people with severe mental illness (SMI).
<ABS> The primary focus of interest was admissions to hospital.
<ABS> However, all evidence was either low or very low quality and further research is needed to determine whether collaborative care is good for people with SMI in terms of clinical outcomes or helping people feel better as well as its cost effectiveness.
<ABS> This summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray (Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The intervention aims to improve the physical and/or mental health care of individuals with SMI.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> The primary outcome of interest was psychiatric admissions.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Specialised register in April 2011.
<MaM> The register is compiled from systematic searches of major databases, handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings.
<MaM> We also contacted 51 experts in the field of SMI and collaborative care.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and we calculated mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data.
<MaM> Risk of bias was assessed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one RCT (306 participants; US veterans with bipolar disorder I or II) in this review.
<RES> We did not find any trials meeting our inclusion criteria that included people with schizophrenia.
<RES> The trial provided data for one comparison: collaborative care versus standard care.
<RES> All results are 'low or very low quality evidence'.
<RES> Data indicated that collaborative care reduced psychiatric admissions at year two in comparison to standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.99).
<RES> The sensitivity analysis showed that the proportion of participants psychiatrically hospitalised was lower in the intervention group than the standard care group in year three: 28% compared to 38% (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99).
<RES> In comparison to the standard care group, collaborative care significantly improved the Mental Health Component (MHC) of quality of life at the three-year follow-up, (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 3.50, 95% CI 1.80 to 5.20).
<RES> The Physical Health Component (PHC) of the quality of life measure at the three-year follow-up did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.91).
<RES> Direct intervention (all-treatment) costs of collaborative care at the three-year follow-up did not differ significantly from standard care (n = 306, 1 RCT, MD -$2981.00, 95% CI $16934.93 to $10972.93).
<RES> The proportion of participants leaving the study early did not differ significantly between groups (n = 306, 1 RCT, RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.79).
<RES> There is no trial-based information regarding the effect of collaborative care for people with schizophrenia.
<RES> No statistically significant differences were found between groups for number of deaths by suicide at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.32), or the number of participants that died from all other causes at three years (n = 330, 1 RCT, RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.66).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people living in long-term care (LTC).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> LTC is the name used for residential homes, which provide personal care, supervision with medications and some help with day to day activities, and nursing homes, which provide 24-hour nursing care.
<ABS> Delirium is a common and serious illness for older people living in LTC.
<ABS> People with delirium usually become more confused over a few hours or a couple of days.
<ABS> Some people with delirium become quiet and sleepy but others become agitated and disorientated, so it can be a very distressing condition.
<ABS> It can also increase the chances of being admitted to hospital and developing dementia, and LTC residents who develop delirium are at increased risk of death.
<ABS> Importantly, studies of people in hospital have shown that it is possible to prevent around a third of cases of delirium by providing an environment and care plan that target the main risk factors for delirium.
<ABS> For example: providing better lighting and signs to avoid disorientation; avoiding unnecessary use of catheters to help prevent infection; avoiding medications which increase delirium risk.
<ABS> This review has searched for and assessed research on preventing delirium in older people living in LTC.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence is current to 04/2013.
<ABS> We found two studies that included 3636 participants.
<ABS> Both studies were done in the United States.
<ABS> The first study tested whether delirium can be prevented by calculating how much fluid an older person in a care home needs each day and ensuring that hydration was provided by giving regular drinks.
<ABS> 98 people participated in the study, which lasted four weeks.
<ABS> The second study tested the effect of a computer programme which searched prescriptions for medications that might increase the chance of developing delirium so that a pharmacist could adjust or stop them.
<ABS> 3538 people participated in the study, which lasted 12 months.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> The first study found that the hydration intervention did not reduce delirium.
<ABS> However, this was a small study of short duration with serious design problems.
<ABS> The second study found that the computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review reduced delirium but there was no clear reduction in hospital admissions, deaths or falls.
<ABS> One problem with the findings of this study is that it might not be possible to use this computer programme in different countries that do not have similar computer systems.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> There is very low-quality evidence on the effectiveness of hydration interventions for reducing the incidence of delirium in older people in LTC.
<ABS> It is therefore not possible to draw firm conclusions.
<ABS> There is moderate-quality evidence that a computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review may reduce the incidence of delirium in older people in LTC.
<ABS> There is no clear evidence that a computerised medication search programme and pharmacist review reduces hospitalisation, mortality or falls for older people in LTC.
<ABS> As this review only found a very small number of research studies, we have recommended that further research should be conducted testing different ways of preventing delirium for older people living in LTC.
<ABS> This may help improve the quality of care for this vulnerable group.
<ABS> External funding
<ABS> There was no source of external funding for this review.
<ABS> Conflicts of interest
<ABS> NS is chief investigator for a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) grant to investigate the effects of a delirium prevention intervention for older people in long term care.
<ABS> JY is a co-applicant for a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) grant to investigate the effects of a delirium prevention intervention for older people in long term care.
<ABS> AC, RH and AH declare that they have no known conflicts of interest.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Delirium is a common and distressing complication of a range of stressor events including infection, new medications and environment change that is often experienced by older people with frailty and dementia.
<INT> Older people living in institutional long-term care (LTC) are at high risk of delirium, which increases the risk of admission to hospital, development of or worsening of dementia, and mortality.
<INT> Delirium is also associated with substantial healthcare costs.
<INT> Although it is possible to prevent delirium in the hospital setting by providing multicomponent delirium prevention interventions it is currently unclear whether interventions to prevent delirium in LTC are effective.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing delirium in older people in long term care.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois) - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialised Register - on 23 April 2013.
<MaM> The search was as sensitive as possible to identify all studies on ALOIS relating to delirium.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two independent review authors examined the titles and abstracts of citations identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data, with any disagreements settled by consensus.
<MaM> Primary outcomes were prevalence, incidence and severity of delirium.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included new diagnosis of dementia, activities of daily living, quality of life and adverse outcomes.
<MaM> We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes and hazard ratios (HR) for time to event data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two trials that recruited 3636 participants.
<RES> Both were complex single-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions.
<RES> Risk of bias for many items was unclear due to inadequate reporting.
<RES> Notably, there was no evidence of blinding of trial participants or assessors in either trial.
<RES> One small cluster-RCT (n = 98) of a hydration-based intervention reported no reduction in delirium incidence in the intervention group compared to control (RR 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 4.00, analysis not adjusted for clustering, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Results were imprecise and there were serious limitations evident in trial design.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Our review identified very limited evidence on interventions for preventing delirium in older people in LTC.
<CON> Introduction of a software-based intervention to identify medications that could contribute to delirium risk so that a pharmacist-led medication review and monitoring plan can be initiated may reduce incidence of delirium for older people in institutional LTC.
<CON> This is based on one large RCT in the United States and may not be practical in other countries which do not have comparable information technology services available in care homes.
<CON> Our review identified only one ongoing pilot trial of a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention and no trials of pharmacological agents.
<CON> Future trials of computerised medication management systems and multicomponent non-pharmacological and pharmacological delirium prevention interventions for older people in LTC are needed to help inform the provision of evidence-based care for this vulnerable group.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The first line of treatment of schizophrenia is usually antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> The search was carried out 15 November 2012 and resulted in identification of four potential studies, but none could be included.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Clozapine-induced hypersalivation has been addressed in another Cochrane review.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (15 November 2012) and inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant studies.
<MaM> We were to contact the first author of each included study for information regarding unpublished trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We inspected the results of the search to identify relevant studies.
<MaM> We were to extract data onto standard, simple forms.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved through discussion.
<MaM> The risk of bias was to be assessed using the Cochrane risk assessment tool.
<MaM> For binary outcomes, we were to calculate a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).
<MaM> For continuous outcomes, we were to estimate the mean difference between groups.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search resulted in four potential studies; after inspection, all were excluded.
<RES> Three studies were excluded because they involved people with clozapine-induced hypersalivation - a topic covered in another Cochrane review.
<RES> People in the control group received an anticholinergic drug (artane) or an antihistamine (phenergan).
<RES> It was not possible to separate clozapine- from non-clozapine-treated people in the intervention group, or to separate artane-treated people from phenergan-treated people in the control group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We have been unable to locate any studies addressing the question raised in this review.
<CON> Accordingly, this empty review points out an important clinical problem that needs to be investigated via well-designed and well-conducted randomised trials.
<CON> Clinicians and patients are likely to continue with their current dependence on clinical judgement and personal experience.
<CON> Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base guidelines for the treatment of hypersalivation induced by neuroleptics other than clozapine.
<CON> They are likely to continue to rely on opinion and habit when making recommendations.
<CON> Funders of studies may wish to make this important subgroup of people a priority in future research.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Tiotropium versus ipratropium bromide for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Tiotropium versus ipratropium bromide in the management of COPD

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease that includes the conditions chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
<ABS> COPD is mainly caused by smoking or inhaling dust, which leads to blockage or narrowing of the airways.
<ABS> The symptoms include breathlessness and a chronic cough.
<ABS> Tiotropium is an inhaled medication, taken once a day, to help widen the airways (bronchodilator) and is used in the management of COPD.
<ABS> Ipratropium bromide is also a bronchodilator but has a shorter duration of action and has to be taken several times a day.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> We found two studies including 1073 participants that compared the long-term effectiveness and side effects of tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide.
<ABS> One trial was 12 weeks long and one was a year long.
<ABS> The people included in the studies had moderate to severe COPD (average forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 40% the predicted value).
<ABS> Compared to ipratropium bromide, tiotropium treatment led to improved lung function, fewer COPD exacerbations, fewer hospital admissions (including those for exacerbations of COPD) and improved quality of life.
<ABS> Tiotropium appears to be safer with fewer adverse events, but there was no significant difference in deaths with ipratropium bromide when compared to tiotropium.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall the evidence was of moderate to high quality.
<ABS> Tiotrpium is available in two different inhalers, Respimat and Handihaler.
<ABS> There are some safety concerns regarding the safety of the Respimat device but we await the publication of a trial before we can conclusively say that this is the case; and this will be reported in another Cochrane Review.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Based on this review, tiotropium has more benefits than ipratropium bromide for people with stable moderate to severe COPD.
<ABS> The review was current as of November 2012.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Tiotropium and ipratropium bromide are both recognised treatments in the management of people with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and then extracted data on study quality and outcome results.
<MaM> We contacted trial sponsors for additional information.
<MaM> We analysed the data using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan 5.2).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review included two studies of good methodological quality that enrolled 1073 participants with COPD.
<RES> The studies used a similar design and inclusion criteria and were of at least 12 weeks duration; the participants had a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% predicted value at baseline.
<RES> One study used tiotropium via the HandiHaler (18 µg) for 12 months and the other via the Respimat device (5 µg and 10 µg) for 12 weeks.
<RES> In general, the treatment groups were well matched at baseline but not all outcomes were reported for both studies.
<RES> Overall the risk of bias across the included RCTs was low.
<RES> For primary outcomes this review found that at the three months trough (the lowest level measured before treatment) FEV1 significantly increased with tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide (mean difference (MD) 109 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI) 81 to 137, moderate quality evidence, I2 = 62%).
<RES> There were fewer people experiencing one or more non-fatal serious adverse events on tiotropium compared to ipratropium (odds ratio (OR) 0.5; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.73, high quality evidence).
<RES> This represents an absolute reduction in risk from 176 to 97 per 1000 people over three to 12 months.
<RES> Concerning disease specific adverse events, the tiotropium group were also less likely to experience a COPD-related serious adverse event when compared to ipratropium bromide (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There was no significant difference in mortality between the treatments (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.44 to 4.39, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> One study measured quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); the mean SGRQ score at 52 weeks was lower in the tiotropium group than the ipratropium group (lower on the scale is favourable) (MD -3.30; 95% CI -5.63 to -0.97, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> From the 1073 participants there were significantly fewer withdrawals from the tiotropium group (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.83, high quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review shows that tiotropium treatment, when compared with ipratropium bromide, was associated with improved lung function, fewer hospital admissions (including those for exacerbations of COPD), fewer exacerbations of COPD and improved quality of life.
<CON> There were both fewer serious adverse events and disease specific events in the tiotropium group, but no significant difference in deaths with ipratropium bromide when compared to tiotropium.
<CON> Thus, tiotropium appears to be a reasonable choice (instead of ipratropium bromide) for patients with stable COPD, as proposed in guidelines.
<CON> We would advise some caution with tiotropium via the Respimat inhaler and suggest waiting for further information from an ongoing head-to-head trial comparing mortality in relation to tiotropium delivery devices and doses.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Alternating and combined antipyretics for treatment of fever in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> When they are ill with infections, children often develop a fever.
<ABS> The fever with common viral illnesses, such as colds, coughs, sore throats and gastrointestinal illness, usually lasts a few days, makes children feel unwell, and is distressing for the children, their parents, or other caregivers.
<ABS> Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) and ibuprofen lower the child's temperature and relieve their discomfort.
<ABS> This review evaluates whether giving both treatments together, or alternating the two treatments, is more effective than giving paracetamol or ibuprofen alone.
<ABS> In September 2013, we found six studies, involving 915 children, that evaluated combined or alternating paracetamol and ibuprofen to treat fever in children.
<ABS> Compared to giving ibuprofen or paracetamol alone, giving both medications together is probably more effective at lowering temperature for the first four hours after treatment (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> However, only one trial assessed whether combined treatment made children less uncomfortable or distressed and found no difference compared to ibuprofen or paracetamol alone.
<ABS> In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child continues to have a fever.
<ABS> Giving alternating treatment in this way may be more effective at lowering temperature for the first three hours after the second dose (low quality evidence), and may also result in less child discomfort (low quality evidence)
<ABS> Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy and found no advantages between the two (very low quality evidence).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, there is uncertainty about whether these regimens are better than the use of single agents, and about the adverse effect profile of combination regimens.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> One review author and two assistants independently screened the searches and applied inclusion criteria.
<MaM> Two authors assessed risk of bias and graded the evidence independently.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six studies, enrolling 915 participants, are included.
<RES> Compared to giving a single antipyretic alone, giving combined paracetamol and ibuprofen to febrile children can result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after treatment (MD -0.27 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08, two trials, 163 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> If no further antipyretics are given, combined treatment probably also results in a lower mean temperature at four hours (MD -0.70 °Celsius, 95% CI -1.05 to -0.35, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence), and in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for at least four hours after treatment (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.42, two trials, 196 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Only one trial assessed a measure of child discomfort (fever associated symptoms at 24 hours and 48 hours), but did not find a significant difference in this measure between the treatment regimens (one trial, 156 participants, evidence quality not graded).
<RES> In practice, caregivers are often advised to initially give a single agent (paracetamol or ibuprofen), and then give a further dose of the alternative if the child's fever fails to resolve or recurs.
<RES> Giving alternating treatment in this way may result in a lower mean temperature at one hour after the second dose (MD -0.60 °Celsius, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.26, two trials, 78 participants, low quality evidence), and may also result in fewer children remaining or becoming febrile for up to three hours after it is given (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55, two trials, 109 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> One trial assessed child discomfort (mean pain scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours), finding that these mean scores were lower, with alternating therapy, despite fewer doses of antipyretic being given overall (one trial, 480 participants, low quality evidence)
<RES> Only one small trial compared alternating therapy with combined therapy.
<RES> No statistically significant differences were seen in mean temperature, or the number of febrile children at one, four or six hours (one trial, 40 participants, very low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no serious adverse events in the trials that were directly attributed to the medications used.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Healthcare workers can hurt themselves accidentally with needles or sharp instruments that have been used in patient care.
<ABS> This carries a small risk that the healthcare worker becomes infected with a viral disease such as hepatitis or HIV.
<ABS> Therefore it is important to prevent blood contact to prevent infection.
<ABS> We evaluated whether the use of gloves, more than one layer of gloves or special gloves can prevent needles or sharp instruments from piercing the skin.
<ABS> Up until June 2013, we found 34 studies that evaluated 6890 operations.
<ABS> There were no studies in non-surgical staff.
<ABS> Two pairs of gloves compared to one pair only
<ABS> In 12 studies, two pairs of gloves reduced the number of perforations in gloves by 71% compared to the use of one pair of gloves.
<ABS> In three studies, two pairs of gloves reduced blood stains on the skin by 65%.
<ABS> The reduction in self reported needlestick injuries was less clear.
<ABS> Three pairs of gloves compared to two pairs of ordinary gloves
<ABS> One low-quality study showed that triple gloves compared to double gloves can further reduce perforations.
<ABS> A pair of thicker or special gloves compared to a pair of ordinary gloves
<ABS> Five low-quality studies showed that the number of perforations was similar for thicker and thinner gloves.
<ABS> In two low-quality studies, the use of one pair of fabric gloves over one pair of normal gloves reduced perforations compared to two pairs of normal gloves.
<ABS> This was similar for gloves made from special material such as fabric or steel, used in between normal gloves.
<ABS> Indicator gloves
<ABS> Indicator gloves show a coloured spot when they are pierced.
<ABS> Two studies showed that they reduced the number of perforations per glove but not the total amount of perforations.
<ABS> Sensitivity of the fingers
<ABS> There were no indications that using more layers of gloves decreased sensitivity of the fingers.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> Surgeons and surgical staff can reduce their risk of contracting a serious viral infection by wearing two pairs of gloves instead of one pair of gloves.
<ABS> The use of three glove layers or gloves made from special material probably reduces the risk further but these need better evaluation.
<ABS> We need further studies to evaluate whether gloves have a similar preventive effect in other healthcare professionals outside the operating theatre.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Healthcare workers are at risk of acquiring viral diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV through exposure to contaminated blood and body fluids at work.
<INT> Such occurrences are commonly known as percutaneous exposure incidents.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> We performed meta-analyses for seven different comparisons.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found 34 RCTs that included 6890 person-operations as participating units and reported on 46 intervention-control group comparisons.
<RES> We grouped interventions as follows: increased layers of standard gloves, gloves manufactured with special protective materials or thicker gloves, and gloves with puncture indicator systems.
<RES> Indicator gloves show a coloured spot when they are perforated.
<RES> Participants were surgeons in all studies and they used at least one pair of standard gloves as the control intervention.
<RES> Twenty-seven studies also included other surgical staff (e.g. nurses).
<RES> All but one study used perforations in gloves as an indication of exposure.
<RES> The median control group rate was 18.5 perforations per 100 person-operations.
<RES> Seven studies reported blood stains on the skin and two studies reported self reported needlestick injuries.
<RES> Six studies reported dexterity as visual analogue scale scores for the comparison double versus single gloves, 13 studies reported outer glove perforations.
<RES> We judged the included studies to have a moderate to high risk of bias.
<RES> We found moderate-quality evidence that double gloves compared to single gloves reduce the risk of glove perforation (rate ratio (RR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.37) and the risk of blood stains on the skin (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70).
<RES> Two studies with a high risk of bias also reported the effect of double compared to single gloves on needlestick injuries (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.62).
<RES> We found low-quality evidence in one small study that the use of three gloves compared to two gloves reduces the risk of perforation further (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.52).
<RES> There was similar low-quality evidence that the use of one fabric glove over one normal glove reduces perforations compared to two normal gloves (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.93).
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence that this effect was similar for the use of one special material glove between two normal material gloves.
<RES> Thicker gloves did not perform better than thinner gloves.
<RES> There was moderate to low-quality evidence in two studies that an indicator system does not reduce the total number of perforations during an operation even though it reduces the number of perforations per glove used.
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence that double gloves have a similar number of outer glove perforations as single gloves, indicating that there is no loss of dexterity with double gloves (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.31).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is low-quality evidence that triple gloving and the use of special gloves can further reduce the risk of glove perforations compared to double gloving with normal material gloves.
<CON> The preventive effect of double gloves on percutaneous exposure incidents in surgery does not need further research.
<CON> Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of special material gloves and triple gloves, and of gloves in other occupational groups.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs.
<ABS> In children it is one of the leading causes of childhood deaths across the globe.
<ABS> Pneumonia can be classified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.
<ABS> This classification involves assessment of certain clinical signs and symptoms and the severity of disease.
<ABS> The treatment is then tailored according to the classification.
<ABS> For non-severe pneumonia, the WHO recommends the use of oral antibiotics for treatment.
<ABS> However, pneumonia is caused more commonly by viruses that do not require antibiotic management but rather supportive care.
<ABS> On the other hand, pneumonia caused by bacteria needs management with antibiotics to avoid complications.
<ABS> Since there is no clear way to distinguish quickly which organism actually caused pneumonia, it is considered safe to give antibiotics.
<ABS> However, it may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance and thus limit their use in future infections.
<ABS> Thus the question arises as to whether the use of antibiotics is justified in non-severe pneumonia.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We have tried to identify evidence as to whether there is a difference in the outcomes of treatment with or without antibiotics for non-severe pneumonia in children aged 2 to 59 months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We performed a search for clinical trials published until March 2014 that evaluated this question.
<ABS> We were unable to identify any studies that were conducted on our review question.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Worldwide, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age and accounts for approximately two million deaths annually.
<INT> The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed case management guidelines based on simple clinical signs to help clinicians decide on the appropriate pneumonia treatment.
<INT> Children and infants who exhibit fast breathing (50 breaths per minute or more in infants two months to 12 months of age and 40 or more in children 12 months to five years of age) and cough are presumed to have non-severe pneumonia and the WHO recommends antibiotics.
<INT> Implementation of these guidelines to identify and manage pneumonia at the community level has been shown to reduce acute respiratory infection (ARI)-related mortality by 36%, although apprehension exists regarding these results due to the questionable quality of evidence.
<INT> As WHO guidelines do not make a distinction between viral and bacterial pneumonia, these children continue to receive antibiotics because of the concern that it may not be safe to do otherwise.
<INT> Therefore, it is essential to explore the role of antibiotics in children with WHO-defined non-severe pneumonia and wheeze and to develop effective guidelines for initial antibiotic treatment.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic therapy versus no antibiotic therapy for children aged two to 59 months with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze.
<MaM> We have excluded non-RCTs (quasi-RCTs).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the search results and extracted data.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is a clear need for RCTs to address this question in representative populations.
<CON> We do not currently have evidence to support or challenge the continued use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia, as suggested by WHO guidelines.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> To assess the effects of reminder systems to increase uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Some women experience high blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy (termed GDM).
<ABS> Although these high blood glucose concentrations usually normalise immediately after birth, women who have experienced GDM are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.
<ABS> It is therefore important that they are regularly tested for higher than normal blood glucose levels (to detect type 2 diabetes or 'impaired glucose tolerance' which is a prediabetic state sometimes preceding type 2 diabetes), starting in the months after they have given birth.
<ABS> However, for a variety of reasons, many women do not get their blood glucose tested after experiencing GDM.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> A single study of 256 women who had experienced GDM whether posting reminder letters to 213 women or their doctors, three months after the birth of a baby, would help to increase the number of women taking a blood glucose test compared with 43 women sent no reminder.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> This study showed that, compared with no reminder, a postal reminder was around two to four times (depending on the blood glucose test concerned) more likely to encourage women who had experienced GDM to take a blood glucose test three months after having their baby.
<ABS> It did not seem to make a difference if the reminder was sent to the woman only, the physician only or to both the woman and the physician.
<ABS> The trial did not assess women's quality of life, or how many women were subsequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose results after giving birth.
<ABS> Other kinds of reminders such as email and telephone need to be assessed in studies as they might be easier and more convenient for women than posted reminders.
<ABS> We need to know more about women's preferences and attitudes, and also to find out whether increasing the chances of a woman being tested helps to reduce her risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future, for example by encouraging a healthier diet and more exercise.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was considered low as the only included study involved few numbers of participants and provided imprecise results.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of June 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The early postpartum period is an important time in which to identify the risk of diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance.
<MaM> One author extracted the data, carried out 'Risk of bias' assessments and evaluated the overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria; the other author double-checked these procedures.
<MaM> Meta-analysis was not possible as only one study was eligible for inclusion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial with an unclear risk of bias in the majority of domains was included in the study; the overall study quality was judged to be low.
<RES> This factorial trial of 256 women compared three types of postal reminder strategies (in a total of 213 women) with usual care (no postal reminder, 43 women) and reported on the uptake of four possible types of glucose tests.
<RES> The three strategies investigated were: reminders sent to both the woman and the physician; reminder sent to the woman only; and reminder sent to the physician only, all issued approximately three months after the woman had given birth.
<RES> There was low-quality evidence that all three reminder interventions increased uptake of oral glucose tolerance tests compared with usual care (no reminder system): reminders to the woman and the physician (uptake 60% versus 14%): risk ratio 4.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 9.71); 116 participants); reminder to the woman only (uptake 55% versus 14%): RR 3.87 (95% CI 1.68 to 8.93); 111 participants); reminder to the physician only (uptake 52% versus 14%): RR 3.61 (95% CI 1.50 to 8.71); 66 participants).
<RES> This represented an increase in uptake from 14% in the no reminder group to 57% across the three reminder groups.
<RES> There was also an increase in uptake of fasting glucose tests in the reminder group compared with the usual care group: reminders to the woman and the physician versus no reminder (uptake 63% versus 40%): RR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.44); reminder to the woman only (uptake 71% versus 40%): RR 1.78 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.73); reminder to the physician only (uptake 68% versus 40%): RR 1.69 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.72).
<RES> Uptake of random glucose and glycated haemoglobin A1c tests was low, and no statistically significant differences were seen between the reminder and no reminder groups for these tests.
<RES> Uptake of any test was higher in each of the reminder groups compared with the no reminder group (RR 1.65 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.41); 1.73 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.52); and 1.55 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.38) in the respective reminder groups.
<RES> The trial did not report this review's other primary outcomes (proportion of women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or showing impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose after giving birth; or health-related quality of life).
<RES> Nor did it report any secondary review outcomes such as diabetes-associated morbidity, lifestyle changes, need for insulin, recurrence of GDM or women's and/or health professionals' views of the intervention.
<RES> No adverse events of the intervention were reported.
<RES> Subgroup interaction tests gave no indication that dual reminders (to both women and physicians) were more successful than single reminders to either women or physicians alone.
<RES> It was also not clear if test uptakes between women in the reminder and no reminder groups differed by type of glucose test undertaken.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Results from the only trial that fulfilled our inclusion criteria showed low-quality evidence for a marked increase in the uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes in women with previous GDM following the issue of postal reminders.
<CON> The effects of other forms of reminder systems need to be assessed to see whether test uptake also increases when email and telephone reminders are deployed.
<CON> We also need a better understanding of why some women fail to take opportunities to be screened postpartum.
<CON> As the ultimate aim of increasing postpartum testing is to prevent the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes, it is important to determine whether increased test uptake rates also increase women's use of preventive strategies such as lifestyle modifications.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Atypical antipsychotics for psychosis in adolescents

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses often begin in adolescence, and treatment of adolescents with psychosis usually involves use of antipsychotic drugs.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by Benjamin Gray, Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness (Email: ben.gray@rethink.org).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Schizophrenia often presents in adolescence, but current treatment guidelines are based largely on studies of adults with psychosis.
<INT> The current systematic review collates and critiques evidence obtained on the use of various atypical antipsychotic medications for adolescents with psychosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (October 2011), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO.
<MaM> We inspected references of all identified studies and contacted study authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies to ask for more information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included studies published in English and in other languages that were available in standardised databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors AK and SSD selected the studies, rated the quality of the studies and performed data extraction.
<MaM> For dichotomous data, we estimated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> When possible, for binary data presented in the 'Summary of findings' table, we calculated illustrative comparative risks.
<MaM> We summated continuous data using the mean difference (MD).
<MaM> Risk of bias was assessed for included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 13 RCTs, with a total of 1112 participants.
<RES> We found no data on service utilisation, economic outcomes, behaviour or cognitive response.
<RES> Trials were classified into the following groups.
<RES> 1.
<RES> Atypical antipsychotics versus placeboOnly two studies compared one atypical antipsychotic medication with placebo.
<RES> In one study, the number of non-responders treated with olanzapine was not different from the number treated with placebo (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.10); however, significantly more (57% vs 32%) people left the study early (1 RCT, n = 107, RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87) from the placebo group compared with the olanzapine group.
<RES> With regard to adverse effects, young people treated with aripiprazole had significantly lower serum cholesterol compared with those given placebo (1 RCT, n = 302, RR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88 to 7.58).
<RES> 2.
<RES> Atypical antipsychotics versus typical antipsychoticsWhen the findings of all five trials comparing atypical antipsychotic medications with a typical antipsychotic medication were collated, no difference in the mean end point Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was noted between the two arms (5 RCTs, n = 236, MD -1.08, 95% CI -3.08 to 0.93).
<RES> With regard to adverse effects, the mean end point serum prolactin concentration was much higher than the reference range for treatment with risperidone, olanzapine and molindone in one of the studies.
<RES> However, fewer adolescents who were receiving atypical antipsychotic medications left the study because of adverse effects (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.15) or for any reason (3 RCTs, n = 187, RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.97).
<RES> 3.
<RES> One atypical antipsychotic versus another atypical antipsychoticThe mean end point BPRS score was not significantly different for people who received risperidone compared with those who received olanzapine; however, the above data were highly skewed.
<RES> Overall no difference was noted in the number of people leaving the studies early because of any adverse effects between each study arm in the three studies comparing olanzapine and risperidone (3 RCTs, n = 130, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.04).
<RES> Specific adverse events were not reported uniformly across the six different studies included in this section of the review; therefore it was difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of adverse events for different atypical antipsychotic medications.
<RES> 4.
<RES> Lower-dose atypical antipsychotic versus standard/higher-dose atypical antipsychoticThree studies reported comparisons of lower doses of the atypical antipsychotic medication with standard/higher doses of the same medication.
<RES> One study reported better symptom reduction with a standard dose of risperidone as compared with a low dose (1 RCT, n = 257, RR -8.00, 95% CI -13.75 to -2.25).
<RES> In another study, no difference was reported in the number of participants not achieving remission between the group receiving 10 mg/d and those who received 30 mg/d of aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 196, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48).
<RES> Similarly in the other study, authors reported no statistically significant difference in clinical response between the two groups receiving lower-dose (80 mg/d) and higher-dose (160 mg/d) ziprasidone, as reflected by the mean end point BPRS score (1 RCT, n = 17, MD -4.40, 95% CI -19.20 to 10.40).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No convincing evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic medications are superior to typical medications for the treatment of adolescents with psychosis.
<CON> However, atypical antipsychotic medications may be more acceptable to young people because fewer symptomatic adverse effects are seen in the short term.
<CON> Little evidence is available to support the superiority of one atypical antipsychotic medication over another, but side effect profiles are different for different medications.
<CON> Treatment with olanzapine, risperidone and clozapine is often associated with weight gain.
<CON> Aripiprazole is not associated with increased prolactin or with dyslipidaemia.
<CON> Adolescents may respond better to standard-dose as opposed to lower-dose risperidone, but for aripiprazole and ziprasidone, lower doses may be equally effective.
<CON> Future trials should ensure uniform ways of reporting.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In children who have inadequate control of their asthma on low doses of ICS, anti-leukotrienes can be added to ICS.
<ABS> Anti-leukotrienes are a class of anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma.
<ABS> Almost a decade ago, a Cochrane review (Ducharme 2004) evaluating the addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS in children and adults with asthma identified only two studies of children, one of which was only published as an abstract with insufficient information to contribute data.
<ABS> Considering the publication of several additional studies in the past decade, we wished to update the review with the latest literature.
<ABS> Review question: To compare the effectiveness and safety of the addition of an anti-leukotriene agent to ICS to the use of the same dose of ICS alone, an increased dose of ICS, or a reduced dose of ICS in children aged one to 18 years with persistent asthma who are not well controlled with ICS alone.
<ABS> Study characteristics: The evidence was updated until January 2013.
<ABS> We found five studies of children with asthma; of them, four studies, representing 559 children (aged six to 18 years) with mild to moderate asthma, contributed data to the review.
<ABS> No study enrolled pre-school children (i.e. aged under six years).
<ABS> Three studies compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS with the same dose of ICS alone; one study compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS to a higher dose of ICS; and no study tested whether the addition of anti-leukotriene to ICS could allow the tapering of the dose of ICS while maintaining asthma control.
<ABS> All studies used montelukast as the anti-leukotriene agent, which was administered for four to 16 weeks.
<ABS> Included studies enrolled both girls and boys and between 65% and 69% were boys.
<ABS> All trials enrolled children with mild to moderate airway obstruction.
<ABS> Results: Whether comparing the addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS to the same dose or an increased dose of ICS, there was no difference in the number of participants experiencing one or more moderate exacerbations (that is, requiring oral corticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (i.e. requiring a hospital admission).
<ABS> A single study comparing the same ICS dose reported lung function tests and showed no or small group differences depending on the test used.
<ABS> Conclusion: There is no firm evidence to support that adding montelukast to ICS is safe and effective to reduce the occurrence of moderate or severe asthma attacks in children taking low-dose ICS and whose symptoms remain uncontrolled.
<ABS> After being on the market for more than 10 years, the limited number of available studies testing antileukotrienes in children, the absence of data on preschoolers, and the inconsistency of available trials in reporting of efficacy and safety clinical outcomes is disappointing and limit the conclusions.
<ABS> Quality of the results: This review is based on a small number of identified trials conducted in children with asthma; none were conducted in preschoolers.
<ABS> As a single study of moderate duration reported all measures of efficacy and most measures of safety, our confidence in the quality of evidence is low.
<ABS> Other important measures of asthma control were either not measured or reported in different formats, so they could not be pooled.
<ABS> In other words, there are too few paediatric trials to conclude firmly whether either treatment is superior to the other.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of anti-leukotriene agents and ICS to the use of the same, an increased, or a tapering dose of ICS in children and adolescents with persistent asthma who remain symptomatic despite the use of maintenance ICS.
<OBJ> In addition, we wished to determine the characteristics of people or treatments, if any, that influenced the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of anti-leukotrienes.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The search was conducted until January 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five paediatric (parallel group or cross-over) trials met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> We considered two (40%) trials to be at a low risk of bias.
<RES> Four published trials, representing 559 children (aged ≥ six years) and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma, contributed data to the review.
<RES> No trial enrolled preschoolers.
<RES> All trials used montelukast as the anti-leukotriene agent administered for between four and 16 weeks.
<RES> Three trials evaluated the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS compared to the same dose of ICS alone (step 3 versus step 2).
<RES> No statistically significant group difference was observed in the only trial reporting participants with exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over four weeks (N = 268 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 1.91).
<RES> There was also no statistically significant difference in percentage change in FEV₁ (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) with mean difference (MD) 1.3 (95% CI -0.09 to 2.69) in this trial, but a significant group difference was observed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR): N = 218 participants; MD 9.70 L/min (95% CI 1.27 to 18.13) and MD 10.70 (95% CI 2.41 to 18.99), respectively.
<RES> One trial compared the combination of anti-leukotrienes and ICS to a higher-dose of ICS (step 3 versus step 3).
<RES> No significant group difference was observed in this trial for participants with exacerbations requiring rescue oral corticosteroids over 16 weeks (N = 182 participants; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25), nor was there any significant difference in exacerbations requiring hospitalisation.
<RES> There was no statistically significant group difference in withdrawals overall or because of any cause with either protocol.
<RES> No trial explored the impact of adding anti-leukotrienes as a means to taper the dose of ICS.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The addition of anti-leukotrienes to ICS is not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the need for rescue oral corticosteroids or hospital admission compared to the same or an increased dose of ICS in children and adolescents with mild to moderate asthma.
<CON> Although anti-leukotrienes have been licensed for use in children for over 10 years, the paucity of paediatric trials, the absence of data on preschoolers, and the variability in the reporting of relevant clinical outcomes considerably limit firm conclusions.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fractures (breaks) of the thigh bone can be very painful, particularly when a child arrives in a stressful emergency environment and is undergoing assessment.
<ABS> Moving the child to get X-rays or transferring the child to a special bed to support the leg in traction (keeping the leg straight) can cause additional pain, as can placing traction (a pulling force) on the broken thigh.
<ABS> This means that prompt provision of pain relief is an essential part of initial emergency management.
<ABS> This review investigated whether a nerve block, involving the injection of a freezing/numbing medication at the top of the thigh, would provide more effective pain relief than pain medicine given by mouth or into a vein (intravenously, e.g. morphine).
<ABS> We searched several medical databases and trial registries up to January 2013 and contacted researchers.
<ABS> We found one study that looked at the comparison we were interested in.
<ABS> This study was potentially biased, mainly because the care providers, parents and children were aware of the type of pain relief the children received.
<ABS> The study was small, involving 55 children aged 16 months to 15 years, and showed that the children who received one of the two main types of nerve block tended to have less pain after 30 minutes than those who received intravenous morphine for initial pain control.
<ABS> Moreover, children who had nerve blocks continued to have lower pain scores over a six-hour period with less need for additional pain relief.
<ABS> There was insufficient evidence to determine whether children or parents were more satisfied with one method of pain relief than the other.
<ABS> Use of resources (e.g. nursing time, cost of medications) was not measured.
<ABS> The quality of the study included in this review was low and so these conclusions are not certain.
<ABS> Further well designed studies investigating whether nerve blocks are more effective and safer than other means of pain relief are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Children and adolescents with femoral fractures are almost always admitted to hospital.
<INT> They invariably start their hospital experience in the Emergency Department, often requiring transfer to a specialist children's hospital.
<INT> They require analgesia or anaesthesia so that radiographs can be obtained and for management of their fractures.
<INT> The initial care process involves from two to six transfers from stretcher to stretcher/imaging/operating-suite table or hospital bed within the first few hours, so prompt pain relief is essential.
<INT> Systemic analgesia can be provided orally or parenterally.
<INT> Alternatively, a nerve block may be used where local anaesthetic is injected around a nerve to block sensation or freeze the involved area.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We handsearched recent issues of specialist journals and references of relevant articles.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of FNB or FICB for initial pain management compared with systemic opiates in children (aged under 18 years) with fractures of the femur receiving pre-hospital or in hospital emergency care.
<MaM> Primary outcomes included failure of analgesia at 30 minutes, pain levels during procedures and transfers (e.g. to a stretcher or hospital ward) for up to eight hours, and adverse effects.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data using a pre-piloted form.
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for the included study and assessed quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach; i.e. as very low, low, moderate or high.
<MaM> Meta-analysis of results was not possible as we found only one trial that could be included in the review.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one randomised trial of 55 children aged between 16 months to 15 years.
<RES> It compared anatomically-guided FICB versus systemic analgesia with intravenous morphine sulphate.
<RES> The small sample size and the high risk of bias relating to lack of blinding resulted in a low quality rating for all outcomes.
<RES> Overall, the trial provided low quality evidence for better pain management in the FICB group.
<RES> Fewer children in the FICB group had analgesia failure at 30 minutes than in the morphine group (2/26 (8%) versus 8/28 (29%); risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 1.20; P value 0.09).
<RES> The trial did not report on pain during procedures or transfers, or application of analgesia.
<RES> The trial provided low quality evidence that FICB has a better safety profile than morphine, with only four (15%) reports of redness and pain at the injection site, and no reports of the type of adverse effects of systematic analgesia that occurred in the morphine group, such as respiratory depression (six cases (21%)) and vomiting (four cases (14%)).
<RES> No long-term adverse events were reported for either intervention.
<RES> Clinically significant pain relief was achieved in both groups at five minutes; with limited evidence of greater initial pain relief in the FICB group.
<RES> Based on an inspection of graphically-presented data, at least 46% (12/26) of children in the FICB group had no supplementary medication (mainly analgesia) for the six hours of the study, while only 5% (1 or 2/28) of children in the intravenous morphine group went without additional analgesia.
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to determine whether child or parental satisfaction with the method of analgesia favoured either method.
<RES> Resource use was not measured.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Bronchiolitis is a common illness affecting the lower (smaller) respiratory airways in infants (younger than 24 months of age).
<ABS> Usually caused by a viral infection, it results in breathing problems, including cough, fast breathing, wheezing and can cause poor feeding.
<ABS> An emerging method to support breathing is using blended, heated, humidified air and oxygen, through nasal cannulae (tubes) at flow rates higher than two litres per minute, which is the maximum for conventional dry oxygen delivery.
<ABS> This is known as high-flow nasal cannula therapy and it allows the comfortable delivery of high flow rates of an air/oxygen blend which may improve ventilation.
<ABS> One study (19 participants) met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> It showed that high-flow nasal cannula therapy is well tolerated as a treatment for bronchiolitis.
<ABS> Oxygen saturations (blood oxygen levels) were better at eight and 12 hours in participants receiving high-flow nasal cannula therapy than in those receiving oxygen therapy via a head box, but were similar between groups at 24 hours, although this may have been due to higher oxygen flow rates in the high-flow nasal cannula group.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in the duration of oxygen therapy, length of hospitalisation and time to discharge.
<ABS> No adverse events were reported in either group.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula therapy for treating bronchiolitis in infants.
<ABS> The included study provides some indication that HFNC therapy is feasible and well tolerated.
<ABS> However, our evidence is based on one low-quality, small study with uncertainty about the effects and some possibility of bias arising from the study methods.
<ABS> Further research is required to determine the role of high-flow nasal cannula therapy in the management of bronchiolitis in infants.
<ABS> The results of six ongoing studies identified will contribute to the evidence in future updates of this review.
<ABS> The evidence is current to May 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract illness, usually of viral aetiology, affecting infants younger than 24 months of age and is a frequent cause of hospitalisation.
<INT> It causes airway inflammation, mucus production and mucous plugging, resulting in airway obstruction.
<INT> Effective pharmacotherapy is lacking and bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
<INT> Conventional treatment consists of supportive therapy in the form of fluids, supplemental oxygen and respiratory support.
<INT> This may reduce the need for invasive respiratory support thus potentially lowering costs, with clinical advantages and fewer adverse effects.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of HFNC therapy compared with conventional respiratory support in the treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently used a standard template to assess trials for inclusion and extract data on study characteristics, 'Risk of bias' elements and outcomes.
<MaM> We contacted trial authors to request missing data.
<MaM> Outcome measures included the need for invasive respiratory support and time until discharge, clinical severity measures, oxygen saturation, duration of oxygen therapy and adverse events.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The median oxygen saturation (SpO2) was higher in the HFNC group at eight hours (100% versus 96%, P = 0.04) and at 12 hours (99% versus 96%, P = 0.04) but similar at 24 hours.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference in total duration of oxygen therapy, time to discharge or total length of stay between groups.
<RES> No adverse events were reported in either group and no participants in either group required further respiratory support.
<RES> Five ongoing trials were identified but no data were available in May 2013.
<RES> We were not able to perform a meta-analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of HFNC therapy for treating infants with bronchiolitis.
<CON> The current evidence in this review is of low quality, from one small study with uncertainty about the estimates of effect and an unclear risk of performance and detection bias.
<CON> The included study provides some indication that HFNC therapy is feasible and well tolerated.
<CON> Further research is required to determine the role of HFNC in the management of bronchiolitis in infants.
<CON> The results of the ongoing studies identified will contribute to the evidence in future updates of this review.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pregnancy profoundly affects the management of diabetes and having diabetes can lead to complications in pregnancy.
<ABS> The most common complications are early births, large babies, difficult births and the need for caesarean section.
<ABS> Increased risks for the infants at birth include bleeding in the brain (intracranial haemorrhage), the baby’s shoulder becomes stuck (shoulder dystocia), neonatal low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), jaundice and respiratory distress.
<ABS> The babies are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit, and the growing child has an increased risk of having diabetes.
<ABS> Women with existing diabetes that is not well controlled at the time of conception and in the first trimester are at increased risk of miscarriage, having a baby with malformations or a stillbirth.
<ABS> It is important that women's blood glucose levels are very carefully monitored during pregnancy so that appropriate drug or dietary steps can be taken to control the blood glucose levels and to reduce the risk of complications.
<ABS> Several methods for monitoring blood glucose levels are used including self-monitoring, use of telemedicine, continuous glucose monitoring or clinic monitoring during regular antenatal visits.
<ABS> This review collected all the available high-quality research evidence in order to find out if one monitoring method is more effective than another in maternal glycaemic control (fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)), controlling infant birthweight and reducing the risk of complications.
<ABS> The review determined that there is not enough evidence to say with any certainty which monitoring method is best.
<ABS> The nine included trials involved a total of 506 women (436 women with Type 1 diabetes and 70 women with Type 2 diabetes).
<ABS> The trials were from European countries and the USA.
<ABS> The trials looked at different techniques of monitoring and reported on different outcomes.
<ABS> Three comparisons were from single trials only.
<ABS> The number of women in each study was generally small.
<ABS> Five of the nine included studies were at moderate risk of bias and four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias.
<ABS> More research is needed to find out which monitoring method is best at reducing the risk of complications.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended as a key component of the management plan for diabetes therapy during pregnancy.
<INT> The effectiveness of the various monitoring techniques is unclear.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Trials investigating timing and frequency of monitoring were also included.
<MaM> Quasi-RCTs and RCTs using a cluster-randomised design were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search of the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register identified 21 trial reports.
<RES> Following application of eligibility criteria, nine trials were included in this review.
<RES> The included trials involved a total of 506 women (436 women with Type 1 diabetes and 70 women with Type 2 diabetes).
<RES> All trials originated from European countries and the USA.
<RES> None of the studies included women with gestational diabetes.
<RES> Five of the nine included studies were at moderate risk of bias and four studies were at low to moderate risk of bias.
<RES> Primary outcomes were maternal glycaemic control (fasting blood glucose and HbA1c) and infant birthweight or macrosomia.
<RES> Various methods of glucose monitoring were compared in the trials.
<RES> The following comparisons were included in the review: (1) self-monitoring versus standard care, (2) self-monitoring versus hospitalisation, (3) pre-prandial versus post-prandial glucose monitoring, (4) automated telemedicine monitoring versus conventional system, (5) CGM versus intermittent monitoring and (6) constant CGM versus intermittent CGM.
<RES> Neither pooled analyses nor individual trial analyses showed any significant advantages of one monitoring technique over another for primary outcomes (maternal glycaemic control and infant birthweight) and secondary outcomes such as gestational age at birth or preterm birth, frequency of neonatal hypoglycaemia, death of baby including stillbirth, and neonatal intensive care admission.
<RES> Primary outcome data on macrosomia were reported by one trial but at a different cut-off value than that pre-specified for the review.
<RES> Secondary outcomes such as shoulder dystocia, major and minor anomalies were not reported by any of the trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Spinal stenosis occurs when the canal that the spinal nerves go through narrows and presses on nerves, causing pain in the back or legs.
<ABS> It tends to happen more often in older people.
<ABS> Surgery can help reduce the pressure, but although most patients find that their leg pain improves, back pain isn't always helped, and people still have problems carrying out everyday tasks.
<ABS> This review was done to find out whether a supervised  programme of exercise (a rehabilitation programme) after surgery was more helpful for patients in their everyday lives than the usual advice to stay active.
<ABS> We found that very little work had been done in this area; only three studies were suitable for inclusion.
<ABS> More than 300 participants were included in all.
<ABS> Each study involved a rehabilitation programme between 30 and 90 minutes long, provided once or twice weekly and starting six to 12 weeks after surgery.
<ABS> We found that specially designed exercise programmes for people who have had back decompression surgery can help to reduce back pain and can improve their ability to carry out everyday tasks.
<ABS> This was true both in the short term (within six months of surgery) and over the long term (at 12 months).
<ABS> Because only three studies were suitable to be included, we cannot be certain that future studies will not change these conclusions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of back pain that can also give rise to pain in the buttock, thigh or leg, particularly when walking.
<INT> Several possible treatments are available, of which surgery appears to be best at restoring function and reducing pain.
<INT> Surgical outcome is not ideal, and a sizeable proportion of patients do not regain good function.
<INT> No accepted evidence-based approach to postoperative care is known—a fact thathas prompted this review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials by using a predeveloped form.
<MaM> We contacted authors of original trials to request additional unpublished data as required.
<MaM> We recorded baseline characteristics of participants, interventions, comparisons, follow-up and outcome measures to enable assessment of clinical homogeneity.
<MaM> Clinical relevance was independently assessed by using the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), and risk of bias within studies was determined by using CBRG criteria.
<MaM> We pooled individual study results in a meta-analysis when appropriate.
<MaM> For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) when the same measurement scales were used in all studies and the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measurement scales were used.
<MaM> Whenreported means and standard deviations of the outcomes showed that outcome data were skewed, we log-transformed data for all studies in the comparison and performed a meta-analysis on the log-scale.
<MaM> Results of analyses performed on the log-scale were converted back to the original scale.
<MaM> We used a fixed-effect inverse variance model to measure treatment effect when no substantial evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found.
<MaM> When we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random-effects inverse variance model.
<MaM> The primary outcome measure was functional status as measured by a back-specific functional scale.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included measures of leg pain, low back pain and global improvement/general health.
<MaM> We considered statistical significance and clinical relevance of outcomes.
<MaM> We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome on the basis of five criteria, for which evidence was ranked from high to very low quality, depending on the number of criteria met.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our searches yielded 1,726 results, and a total of three studies (N = 373 participants) were included in the review and meta-analysis.
<RES> All studies were deemed to have low risk of bias; no study had unacceptably high dropout rates.
<RES> Also, no unacceptably unbalanced dropout rates, unacceptably low adherence rates or non-adherence to the protocol or clearly significant unbalanced baseline differences were noted for the primary outcome.
<RES> Outcomes in the short term (within six months postoperative)
<RES> Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 340) shows that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.44 to 0.00, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 20%, 95% CI 0% to 36%) and for reported low back pain (log MD -0.18, 95% CI-0.35 to -0.02, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 2% to 30%).
<RES> In contrast, evidence of low quality suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care for leg pain (log MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.19, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 21% worsening to 41% improvement).
<RES> Low-quality evidence from two RCTs (N = 238) indicates that rehabilitation has no additional benefit on general health status as compared to usual care (MD 1.30, 95% CI -4.45 to 7.06).
<RES> Outcomes in the long term (at 12 months postoperative)
<RES> Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 373) shows that rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 23%, 95% CI 5% to 37%), for reported low back pain (log MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 18%, 95% CI 5% to 30%].
<RES> Evidence of moderate quality (N = 373) and for leg pain (log MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.01, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 21%, 95% CI 1% to 37%).
<RES> In contrast, evidence of low quality from two studies (N = 273) suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care with respect to improvement in general health (MD -0.48, 95% CI -6.41 to 5.4).
<RES> None of the included papers reported any relevant adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Evidence suggests that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care in improving both short- and long-term (back-related) functional status.
<CON> The clinical relevance of these effects is medium to small.
<CON> Our evaluation is limited by the small number of relevant studies identified, and further research is required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.
<ABS> Current rehabilitation strategies have limited effectiveness in improving these impairments.
<ABS> One possibility for enhancing the effects of rehabilitation might be the addition of non-invasive brain stimulation through a technique known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
<ABS> This technique can alter how the brain works and may be used to reduce impairment of ADLs and function.
<ABS> However, the effectiveness of this intervention for improving rehabilitation outcomes is still unknown.
<ABS> This review of 15 trials involving 455 participants found evidence of very low to low quality on the effectiveness of tDCS in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes regarding ADL and function.
<ABS> These results are imprecise, and the effect was not sustained when only studies of high methodological quality were included.
<ABS> Proportions of adverse events were comparable between groups.
<ABS> Future research is needed in this area to improve the generalisability of these findings, especially regarding lower limb function.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide.
<INT> Functional impairment resulting in poor performance in activities of daily living (ADLs) among stroke survivors is common.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, May 2013), MEDLINE (1948 to May 2013), EMBASE (1980 to May 2013), CINAHL (1982 to May 2013), AMED (1985 to May 2013), Science Citation Index (1899 to May 2013) and four additional databases.
<MaM> In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched trials registers and reference lists, handsearched conference proceedings and contacted authors and equipment manufacturers.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> If necessary, we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.
<MaM> We collected information on dropouts and adverse events from the trial reports.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 15 studies involving a total of 455 participants.
<RES> Analysis of six studies involving 326 participants regarding our primary outcome, ADL, showed no evidence of an effect in favour of tDCS at the end of the intervention phase (mean difference (MD) 5.31 Barthel Index (BI) points; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 11.14; inverse variance method with random-effects model), whereas at follow-up (MD 11.13 BI points; 95% CI 2.89 to 19.37; inverse variance method with random-effects model), we found evidence of an effect.
<RES> However, the confidence intervals were wide and the effect was not sustained when only studies with low risk of bias were included.
<RES> For our secondary outcome, upper limb function, we analysed eight trials with 358 participants, which showed evidence of an effect in favour of tDCS at the end of the intervention phase (MD 3.45 Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Score points (UE-FM points); 95% CI 1.24 to 5.67; inverse variance method with random-effects model) but not at the end of follow-up three months after the intervention (MD 9.23 UE-FM points; 95% CI -13.47 to 31.94; inverse variance method with random-effects model).
<RES> These results were sensitive to inclusion of studies at high risk of bias.
<RES> Adverse events were reported and the proportions of dropouts and adverse events were comparable between groups (risk difference (RD) 0.00; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects model).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> At the moment, evidence of very low to low quality is available on the effectiveness of tDCS (anodal/cathodal/dual) versus control (sham/any other intervention) for improving ADL performance and function after stroke.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Creatine for Parkinson's disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Creatine for Parkinson's disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in its pathogenesis.
<ABS> Creatine has been shown to help improve mitochondrial function and may, therefore, useful for treating people with Parkinson's disease.
<ABS> Researchers from the Cochrane Collaboration examined the evidence on whether creatine is effective and safe to treat people with Parkinson's disease, used alone or as an adjuvant treatment, up to 10 November 2013.
<ABS> We included two randomized controlled trials with a total of 194 patients that compared creatine with placebo for people with Parkinson's disease.
<ABS> The effect of creatine on improvement of motor function, activities of daily living or quality of life after one or two years treatment for Parkinson's disease was uncertain due to the low quality of the trials and the small number of participants they recruited.
<ABS> The serious adverse events that occurred in the trials were not thought to be related to creatine.
<ABS> However, one trial reported higher rates of gastro-intestinal effects (including diarrhoea, nausea and constipation) with creatine.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in its pathogenesis.
<INT> Creatine is effective in improving mitochondrial function.
<INT> It may therefore be useful for slowing the progression of Parkinson's disease.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Movement Disorders Group Trials Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, November Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to 10 November 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 10 November 2013) and two Chinese databases.
<MaM> We searched ongoing trials registers and conference proceedings, checked reference lists and contacted authors of included trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two RCTs with a total of 194 patients.
<RES> Both trials compared creatine with placebo for Parkinson's disease and both had methodological limitations.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of an effect on motor function (MD -0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.39 to 3.88, low quality evidence), activities of daily living (MD 0.37; 95% CI -1.28 to 2.02, low quality evidence) or quality of life after one or two years of treatment.
<RES> One trial reported serious adverse events that were not attributed to creatine.
<RES> Also, one trial observed higher rates of gastrointestinal effects at two years follow-up.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence base on the effects of creatine in Parkinson's disease is limited by risk of bias, small sample sizes and short duration of the eligible trials.
<CON> It does not provide a reliable basis on which treatment decisions can be made.
<CON> Future well-designed RCTs with larger sample size and long-term follow-up are needed to assess creatine for Parkinson's disease.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Accommodation is the ability of the eye to focus on both distant and near objects.
<ABS> Accommodation is achieved through the contraction of ciliary muscles, which results in an increase in curvature and a forward shift of the natural lens in the eye.
<ABS> Accommodation declines with increasing age due to a decrease in lens elasticity and a reduction in ciliary muscle contraction, resulting in difficulty in near vision (presbyopia).
<ABS> This is a problem for most people in their 40s or 50s.
<ABS> For best optical performance, the lens must be transparent.
<ABS> Cataract is the clouding of the human lens.
<ABS> It is more common with increasing age, and is a common cause of visual impairment.
<ABS> Fortunately, cataract is treatable by a surgical procedure in which the natural lens is removed through a small incision.
<ABS> Once all lens material is removed, an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted into the eye to lie in the original position of the removed natural lens.
<ABS> All functions of the natural lens are preserved by an IOL, with the exception of accommodation.
<ABS> Standard IOLs, known as monofocal IOLs, allow only distant objects to be focused and seen clearly.
<ABS> Patients require spectacles for near vision.
<ABS> This problem after cataract surgery remains a challenge for ophthalmologists.
<ABS> To overcome the loss of accommodation after cataract surgery, various strategies have been tried with variable success.
<ABS> Accommodative IOLs have been designed to restore accommodation.
<ABS> The aim of this systematic review is to help define the extent to which accommodative IOLs improve near vision in comparison with standard monofocal IOLs.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This review looked at four studies that enrolled 229 people (256 eyes) and compared the use of accommodative IOLs to the use of monofocal IOLs in cataract surgery.
<ABS> We last searched for evidence in October 2013.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> The results of the review showed that participants who received accommodative IOLs had improvements in near vision at six months and at 12 months after surgery compared to those who received monofocal IOLs.
<ABS> However, such improvements were small and reduced with time.
<ABS> Low-quality evidence also showed that more than 12 months after surgery, there was a compromise in distance vision for people with accommodative IOLs.
<ABS> This may be related to the finding that those who received accommodative IOLs also appeared to have a higher rate of posterior capsular opacification (thickening and clouding of the tissue behind the IOL).
<ABS> However, these findings were uncertain.
<ABS> Further research on accommodative IOLs is required before we can draw conclusions on their effectiveness and safety compared to monofocal IOLs
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Overall the quality of the evidence was low or very low with the exception for the findings on near vision at six months.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Following cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, loss of accommodation or postoperative presbyopia occurs and remains a challenge.
<INT> Standard monofocal IOLs correct only distance vision; patients require spectacles for near vision.
<INT> Accommodative IOLs have been designed to overcome loss of accommodation after cataract surgery.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials.
<MaM> We last searched the electronic databases on 10 October 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> All included trials used the 1CU accommodative IOL (HumanOptics, Erlangen, Germany) for their intervention group.
<MaM> One trial had an additional arm with the AT-45 Crystalens accommodative IOL (Eyeonics Vision).
<MaM> We performed a separate analysis comparing 1CU and AT-45 IOL.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs, including 229 participants (256 eyes), conducted in Germany, Italy and the UK.
<RES> The age range of participants was 21 to 87 years.
<RES> All studies included people who had bilateral cataracts with no pre-existing ocular pathologies.
<RES> We judged all studies to be at high risk of performance bias.
<RES> We graded two studies with high risk of detection bias and one study with high risk of selection bias.
<RES> Participants who received the accommodative IOLs achieved better distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.10 Jaeger units; 95% confidence intervals (CI) -3.36 to -2.83, 2 studies, 106 people, 136 eyes, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Better DCNVA was seen in the accommodative lens group at 12 to 18 months in the three trials that reported this time point but considerable heterogeneity of effect was seen, ranging from 1.3 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.68; 20 people, 40 eyes) to 6 (95% CI 4.15 to 7.85; 51 people, 51 eyes) Jaeger units and 0.12 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.19; 40 people, binocular) logMAR improvement (low quality evidence).
<RES> The relative effect of the lenses on corrected distant visual acuity (CDVA) was less certain.
<RES> At six months there was a standardised mean difference of -0.04 standard deviations (95% CI -0.37 to 0.30, 2 studies, 106 people, 136 eyes, low quality evidence).
<RES> At long-term follow-up there was heterogeneity of effect with 18-month data in two studies showing that CDVA was better in the monofocal group (MD 0.12 logMAR; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.16, 2 studies, 70 people,100 eyes) and one study which reported data at 12 months finding similar CDVA in the two groups (-0.02 logMAR units, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02, 51 people) (low quality evidence).
<RES> The relative effect of the lenses on reading speed and spectacle independence was uncertain, The average reading speed was 11.6 words per minute more in the accommodative lens group but the 95% confidence intervals ranged from 12.2 words less to 35.4 words more (1 study, 40 people, low quality evidence).
<RES> People with accommodative lenses were more likely to be spectacle-independent but the estimate was very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 8.18; 95% CI 0.47 to 142.62, 1 study, 40 people, very low quality evidence).
<RES> More cases of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) were seen in accommodative lenses but the effect of the lenses on PCO was uncertain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 2.12; 95% CI 0.45 to 10.02, 91 people, 2 studies, low quality evidence).
<RES> People in the accommodative lens group were more likely to require laser capsulotomy (Peto OR 7.96; 95% CI 2.49 to 25.45, 2 studies, 60 people, 80 eyes, low quality evidence).
<RES> Glare was reported less frequently with accommodative lenses but the relative effect of the lenses on glare was uncertain (RR any glare 0.78; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.90, 1 study, 40 people, and RR moderate/severe glare 0.45; 95% CI 0.04 to 4.60, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate-quality evidence that study participants who received accommodative IOLs had a small gain in near visual acuity after six months.
<CON> There is some evidence that distance visual acuity with accommodative lenses may be worse after 12 months but due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of effect, the evidence for this is not clear-cut.
<CON> People receiving accommodative lenses had more PCO which may be associated with poorer distance vision.
<CON> However, the effect of the lenses on PCO was uncertain.
<CON> Further research is required to improve the understanding of how accommodative IOLs may affect near visual function, and whether they provide any durable gains.
<CON> Additional trials, with longer follow-up, comparing different accommodative IOLs, multifocal IOLs and monofocal IOLs, would help map out their relative efficacy, and associated late complications.
<CON> Research is needed on control over capsular fibrosis postimplantation.
<CON> Risks of bias, heterogeneity of outcome measures and study designs used, and the dominance of one design of accommodative lens in existing trials (the HumanOptics 1CU) mean that these results should be interpreted with caution.
<CON> They may not be applicable to other accommodative IOL designs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We included four small randomised controlled trials with a total of 66 participants.
<ABS> Mortality rates ranged from 18% to 47% in the four studies.
<ABS> Only one inotropic drug and one vasodilative were studied in four different comparisons with other active drugs or placebo.
<ABS> Levosimendan showed a trend towards beneficial haemodynamic effects and improved survival rates, but this evidence was based on very limited data which were insufficient to draw robust conclusions.
<ABS> This means that there is no trial evidence for inotropic or vasodilator drugs which shows convincing benefits and confirmed superiority regarding haemodynamic management or survival rates.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and ISI Web of Science, registers of ongoing trials and proceedings of conferences in January 2013.
<MaM> Reference lists were scanned and experts in the field were contacted to obtain further information.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data collection and analysis were performed according to the published protocol.
<MaM> All trials were analysed individually.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four eligible, very small studies were identified from a total of 4065 references.
<RES> Three trials with high overall risk of bias compared levosimendan to standard treatment (enoximone or dobutamine) or placebo.
<RES> Data from a total of 63 participants were included in our comparisons, 31 were treated with levosimendan and 32 served as controls.
<RES> Levosimendan showed an imprecise survival benefit in comparison with enoximone based on a very small trial with 32 participants (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97).
<RES> Results from the other similarly small trials were too imprecise to provide any meaningful information about the effect of levosimendan in comparison with dobutamine or placebo.
<RES> Only small differences in haemodynamics, length of hospital stay and the frequency of major adverse cardiac events or adverse events overall were found between study groups.
<RES> Only one small randomised controlled trial with three participants was found for vasodilator strategies (nitric oxide gas versus placebo) in AMI complicated by CS or LCOS.
<RES> This study was too small to draw any conclusions on the effects on our key outcomes.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Image guided surgery for the resection of brain tumours

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgery has a key role in the management of many types of brain tumour.
<ABS> In some types of brain tumour the amount that can be removed by the surgeon is very important in helping patients live longer and feel better.
<ABS> However, sometimes removing a brain tumour can be difficult, because it either looks like normal brain tissue or is near brain tissue that is very important to making people function normally.
<ABS> New methods of visualising tumours during surgery have been developed to help surgeons better identify tumour from normal brain tissue.
<ABS> Question
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Our search strategy was up to date as of March 2013.
<ABS> We found four trials looking at four different types of tools to help improve the amount of tumour that is removed.
<ABS> The tumour that they looked at was usually high grade glioma but one study also included patients with low grade glioma.
<ABS> Imaging interventions used during surgery included magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) during surgery to assess the amount of remaining tumour, or a fluorescent dye (5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)) to mark out the tumour.
<ABS> Two trials used pre-operative imaging to map out the location of a tumour, which was then used at the time of surgery to guide the resection (neuronavigation).
<ABS> All the studies were at significant risk of bias and some were small and stopped early.
<ABS> Others were funded by the manufacturers of the image guidance tool involved.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found low quality evidence that using image guided surgery can lead to more of the tumour being removed surgically in some people.
<ABS> It has not been proven that any of the techniques that were evaluated improve overall survival.
<ABS> Data about how each technique can affect a patient's quality of life was poorly reported.
<ABS> The side effects of each technique were also poorly reported, but they did not appear to be more common with image guided surgery.
<ABS> There is a concern that taking out more of the tumour using 5-ALA can lead to patients having a type of stroke early after surgery but long-term the risk seems to be no different between techniques.
<ABS> There was very low quality evidence for neuronavigation and no trials were identified for ultrasound guidance.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Evidence for image guided surgery in removing brain tumours is sparse and of low quality.
<ABS> Further research is needed to assess two main questions.
<ABS> What are the risks of making a patient symptomatically worse by taking out more of the tumour, and how may this affect a patient's quality of life?

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To compare image guided surgery with surgery either not using any image guidance or to compare surgery using two different forms of image guidance.
<OBJ> The primary outcome criteria was extent of resection and adverse events.
<OBJ> Other outcome criteria were overall survival; progression free survival; and quality of life (QoL).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The following databases were searched, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 1, 2013), MEDLINE (1948 to March, week 10, 2013) and EMBASE (1970 to 2013, week 10).
<MaM> Reference lists of all identified studies were searched.
<MaM> Two journals, the Journal of Neuro-Oncology and Neuro-oncology, were handsearched from 1991 to 2013, including all conference abstracts.
<MaM> Neuro-oncologists, trial authors and manufacturers were contacted regarding ongoing and unpublished trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Study participants included patients of all ages with a presumed new or recurrent brain tumour (any location or histology) from clinical examination and imaging (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or both).
<MaM> Image guidance interventions included intra-operative MRI (iMRI); fluorescence guided surgery; neuronavigation including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); and ultrasonography.
<MaM> Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with comparisons made either with patients having surgery without the image guidance tool in question or with another type of image guidance tool.
<MaM> Subgroups were to include high grade glioma; low grade glioma; brain metastasis; skull base meningiomas; and sellar or parasellar tumours.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> DTI-neuronavigation (238 patients).
<RES> Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to differences in the tumours included (eloquent versus non-eloquent locations) and variations in the image guidance tools used in the control arms (usually selective utilisation of neuronavigation).
<RES> There were significant concerns regarding risk of bias in all the included studies, especially for the study using DTI-neuronavigation.
<RES> All studies included patients with high grade glioma, with one study also including patients with low grade glioma.
<RES> The extent of resection was increased with iMRI (risk ratio (RR) (incomplete resection) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.96, low quality evidence), 5-ALA (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.71) and DTI-neuronavigation (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.63, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Insufficient data were available to evaluate the effects of neuronavigation on extent of resection.
<RES> Reporting of adverse events was incomplete, with a suggestion of significant reporting bias.
<RES> Overall, reported events were low in most studies, but there was concern that surgical resection using 5-ALA may lead to more frequent early neurological deficits.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of improvement in overall survival (OS) with 5-ALA (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07) or DTI-neuronavigation (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.00) in patients with high grade glioma.
<RES> Progression-free survival (PFS) data were not available in the appropriate format for analysis.
<RES> Data for quality of life (QoL) were only available for one study and suffered from significant attrition bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is a theoretical concern that maximising the extent of resection may lead to more frequent adverse events but this was poorly reported in the included studies.
<CON> Effects of image guided surgery on survival and QoL are unclear.
<CON> Further research, including studies of ultrasound guided surgery, is needed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Computed tomography (CT) angiography for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of brain death

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy review looked at the evidence for the radiology test computed tomography angiography (CTA), which demonstrates blood flow in the main vessels of the brain, to support the results of clinical tests of brain function performed in unconscious patients on mechanical breathing machines who are thought by their doctors to have died.
<ABS> Establishing a correct diagnosis is very important as the diagnosis confirms the death of the patient, which will have profound legal and societal implications including making organs available for transplantation.
<ABS> The diagnosis of death using neurological criteria, or brain death, is usually made by performing a highly specific set of clinical tests on the patient.
<ABS> However in some cases, for example when patients are anaesthetized or heavily sedated, performing these tests may not be possible and additional tests are required such as CTA.
<ABS> In some countries it is a statutory requirement for doctors to always carry out an additional test and recently some clinicians have called for these additional tests to be mandatory even when there is no statutory requirement.
<ABS> It is important for doctors to know how useful CTA is when compared to, or added to, the usual clinical tests.
<ABS> Ten studies were found, including 366 patients in total.
<ABS> Most of the studies were performed in intensive care departments but involved only small numbers of patients.
<ABS> In most studies it would be possible for the doctors performing the CTA test to already know the results of the clinical test.
<ABS> This might affect the study results, however this situation would also be the case in normal medical practice.
<ABS> Methods used to report the CTA study also varied from study to study and so the published results were re-analysed to take this into account.
<ABS> When compared to clinical testing for brain death, the CTA test had a sensitivity of 0.85.
<ABS> This means that in 100 cases of patients satisfying the clinical tests for death, the CTA test will correctly identify 85 of the cases.
<ABS> The data also showed that this might be as few as 77 cases per 100 and as many as 91 cases per 100.
<ABS> Our review was unable to tell us how many patients the CTA might falsely give a diagnosis of death for, when the patient was not dead.
<ABS> Based on these results, it appears that CTA is not good enough to be a compulsory test.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The diagnosis of death using neurological criteria (brain death) has profound social, legal and ethical implications.
<INT> The diagnosis can be made using standard clinical tests examining for brain function, but in some patient populations and in some countries additional tests may be required.
<INT> Computed tomography (CT) angiography, which is currently in wide clinical use, has been identified as one such test.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We performed comprehensive literature searches to identify studies that would assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT angiography (the index test) in cohorts of adult patients, using the diagnosis of brain death according to neurological criteria as the target condition.
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5) and the following databases from January 1992 to August 2012: MEDLINE; EMBASE; BNI; CINAHL; ISI Web of Science; BioMed Central.
<MaM> We also conducted searches in regional electronic bibliographic databases and subject-specific databases (MEDION; IndMed; African Index Medicus).
<MaM> A search was also conducted in Google Scholar where we reviewed the first 100 results only.
<MaM> We handsearched reference lists and conference proceedings to identify primary studies and review articles.
<MaM> Abstracts were identified by two authors.
<MaM> Methodological assessment of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool and further data extraction for re-analysis were performed by three authors.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included in this review all large case series and cohort studies that compared the results of CT angiography with the diagnosis of brain death according to neurological criteria.
<MaM> Uniquely, the reference standard was the same as the target condition in this review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The majority of studies (with one exception) were not designed to include patients who were not brain dead, and therefore overall specificity was not estimable as part of a meta-analysis.
<MaM> Sensitivity, confidence and prediction intervals were calculated for both as-published data and as re-analysed to a standardized interpretation model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten studies were found including 366 patients in total.
<RES> The 95% approximate prediction interval was very wide (0.34 to 0.98).
<RES> Results demonstrated a similar sensitivity estimate of 0.85 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) but with an improved 95% approximate prediction interval (0.56 to 0.96).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Amphetamine dependence constitutes a public health problem with many consequences and complications.
<ABS> Amphetamine abuse refers to a maladaptive and hazardous pattern of use considered to be less severe than dependence.
<ABS> To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for amphetamine abuse or dependence, and psychotherapy remains the best treatment option.
<ABS> Long-term amphetamine use reduces dopamine levels in the brain.
<ABS> Drugs increasing dopamine and mimicking the effects of amphetamines with lower abuse liability could be used as replacement therapy in amphetamine dependence.
<ABS> Several psychostimulants have been studied recently for this purpose.
<ABS> In this review, the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants for amphetamine abuse or dependence were studied.
<ABS> We found eleven studies enrolling 791 amphetamine-dependent participants and assessing the effects of four different psychostimulants: dexamphetamine, bupropion, methylphenidate and modafinil.
<ABS> Psychosocial interventions were additionally provided to all participants.
<ABS> The studies were conducted in the USA, Australia or Northern Europe, and study length ranged from 8 to 20 weeks.
<ABS> Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use or amphetamine craving and also did not increase sustained abstinence in comparison with placebo.
<ABS> Retention in treatment was similar and low with both treatments.
<ABS> Psychostimulants also did not increase the risk of adverse events that were intense enough to induce dropouts.
<ABS> Research with larger and longer trials is needed to determine whether psychostimulants can be a useful replacement therapy for patients with amphetamine abuse or dependence.
<ABS> The design of future trials should consider the level of dependence at study entry, the potency and the dose of the psychostimulant administered, the length of the trial and the representativeness of included participants.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Amphetamine dependence is a public health problem with medical, psychiatric, cognitive, legal and socioeconomic consequences.
<INT> To date, no pharmacological treatment has been approved for this disorder, and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment.
<INT> In recent years, psychostimulants have been investigated as a possible replacement therapy.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant medications for amphetamine abuse or dependence.
<OBJ> The influences of type of drug, type of dependence, comorbid disorders, clinical trial risk of bias and publication of data were also studied.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Relevant trials were searched in the following sources: PubMed (January 1966 to 6 June 2012), EMBASE (January 1988 to 6 June 2012), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 5 of 12, May 2012), PsycINFO (January 1985 to 6 June 2012) and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Group (June 2012).
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of retrieved trials, the list of studies citing the included trials and the main electronic registers of ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and EU Clinical Trials Register).
<MaM> Finally, we contacted investigators to request information about unpublished trials.
<MaM> Searches included non－English language literature.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven studies were included in the review (791 participants).
<RES> No significant differences were found between psychostimulants and placebo for any of the studied efficacy outcomes.
<RES> Overall retention in studies was low (50.4%).
<RES> Psychostimulants did not reduce amphetamine use (mean difference (MD) -0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85 to 0.33) or amphetamine craving (MD 0.07, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.59) and did not increase sustained abstinence (relative risk (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.49).
<RES> The proportion of adverse events inducing dropout was similar for psychostimulants and placebo (risk difference (RD) 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04).
<RES> The main findings did not change in any subgroup analysis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Results of this review do not support the use of psychostimulant medications at the tested doses as a replacement therapy for amphetamine abuse or dependence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People frequently chose to have it for aesthetic (beauty) reasons, so doctors need to minimise the unpleasant effects (complications) associated with these procedures.
<ABS> All surgical procedures produce an inflammatory response, which may cause swelling and bruising.
<ABS> Severe swelling and bruising are troublesome for patients, as they delay full recovery.
<ABS> Why corticosteroids might help
<ABS> Corticosteroids, more often known as 'steroids', are medicines that doctors prescribe to reduce inflammation in a wide range of conditions.
<ABS> They are commonly used in facial plastic surgery to reduce swelling and bruising, though it is not known how efficient or safe they might be.
<ABS> This review tried to find out whether giving corticosteroids around the time of facial plastic surgery reduces swelling and bruising compared to another intervention, no intervention, or a fake medicine (placebo).
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature up to January 2014, and identified 10 relevant medical trials, with a total of 422 participants.
<ABS> People in the studies were assessed for swelling and bruising for up to 10 days after surgery.
<ABS> None of the studies stated the funding source.
<ABS> There was some low quality evidence that a single dose of corticosteroid administered prior to surgery might reduce swelling and bruising over the first two days after surgery, but this advantage was not maintained beyond two days.
<ABS> One study, with 40 participants, showed that high doses of corticosteroid decreased both swelling and bruising between the first and seventh postoperative days.
<ABS> The usefulness of these results is uncertain and there is currently no evidence regarding the safety of the treatment.
<ABS> Five trials did not report on harmful (adverse) effects; four trials reported that there were no adverse effects; and one trial reported adverse effects in two participants treated with corticosteroids as well as in four participants treated with placebo.
<ABS> None of the studies reported recovery time, patient satisfaction or quality of life.
<ABS> Therefore, the current evidence does not support use of corticosteroids as a routine treatment in facial plastic surgery.
<ABS> More trials will need to be conducted before it can be established whether this treatment works and is safe.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Early recovery is an important factor for people undergoing facial plastic surgery.
<INT> However, the normal inflammatory processes that are a consequence of surgery commonly cause oedema (swelling) and ecchymosis (bruising), which are undesirable complications.
<INT> Severe oedema and ecchymosis delay full recovery, and may make patients dissatisfied with procedures.
<INT> Perioperative corticosteroids have been used in facial plastic surgery with the aim of preventing oedema and ecchymosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In January 2014, we searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; EBSCO CINAHL; and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS).
<MaM> There were no restrictions on the basis of date or language of publication.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 trials, with a total of 422 participants, that addressed two of the outcomes of interest to this review: swelling (oedema) and bruising (ecchymosis).
<RES> Nine studies on rhinoplasty used a variety of different types, and doses, of corticosteroids.
<RES> Overall, the results of the included studies showed that there is some evidence that perioperative administration of corticosteroids decreases formation of oedema over the first two postoperative days.
<RES> Meta-analysis was only possible for two studies, with a total of 60 participants, and showed that a single perioperative dose of 10 mg dexamethasone decreased oedema formation in the first two days after surgery (SMD = -1.16, 95% CI: -1.71 to -0.61, low quality evidence).
<RES> The evidence for ecchymosis was less consistent across the studies, with some contradictory results, but overall there was some evidence that perioperatively administered corticosteroids decreased ecchymosis formation over the first two days after surgery (SMD = -1.06, 95% CI:-1.47 to -0.65, two studies, 60 participants, low quality evidence ).
<RES> The difference was not maintained after this initial period.
<RES> One study, with 40 participants, showed that high doses of methylprednisolone (over 250 mg) decreased both ecchymosis and oedema between the first and seventh postoperative days.
<RES> The only study that assessed facelift surgery identified no positive effect on oedema with preoperative administration of corticosteroids.
<RES> Five trials did not report on harmful (adverse) effects; four trials reported that there were no adverse effects; and one trial reported adverse effects in two participants treated with corticosteroids as well as in four participants treated with placebo.
<RES> None of the studies reported recovery time, patient satisfaction or quality of life.
<RES> The studies included were all at an unclear risk of selection bias and at low risk of bias for other domains.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is also limited evidence that high doses of corticosteroids decrease both ecchymosis and oedema between the first and seventh postoperative days.
<CON> The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown and there is little evidence available regarding the safety of this intervention.
<CON> More studies are needed because at present the available evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids for prevention of complications following facial plastic surgery.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic disorder characterised by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, discomfort, bloating, constipation or diarrhoea or both.
<ABS> It is difficult to treat because no single cause has been identified.
<ABS> IBS impairs health-related quality of life and work productivity.
<ABS> Currently there is no agreement on the best form of treatment for IBS.
<ABS> Therefore it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatments, including homeopathic treatment, which some IBS sufferers use.
<ABS> Clinical homeopathy matches a 'remedy' to a specific condition (such as arnica for bruising), whereas individualised homeopathy involves a series of in-depth consultations to assess symptoms, the effects of remedies and other issues that may affect the patient, in order to select appropriate 'remedies'.
<ABS> Individualised homeopathy includes both a consultation and a remedy, whereas clinical homeopathy consists of a remedy without the in-depth consultation.
<ABS> This review identified three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including a total of 213 participants.
<ABS> Two RCTs (129 participants) compared a homeopathic remedy to a placebo remedy for the treatment of constipation-predominant IBS.
<ABS> The other study (23 participants) compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care in female patients diagnosed with IBS.
<ABS> Usual care consisted of high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride (an antispasmodic drug) and faecal bulking agents (e.g. foods high in fibre).
<ABS> Patients in the usual care group received diet sheets asking them to take a high fibre diet.
<ABS> The three trials tested the effects of homeopathic treatment on the severity of IBS symptoms.
<ABS> None of the included studies reported on side effects.
<ABS> The RCT comparing individualised homeopathic treatment to usual care found no statistically significant difference between homeopathic treatment and usual care.
<ABS> No conclusions can be drawn from this study due to the small number of participants and the low quality of reporting in this trial.
<ABS> In addition, this study was carried out in 1990 and usual care for IBS may have changed since then.
<ABS> Therefore it is not known how individualized homeopathic treatment performs when compared with current usual care.
<ABS> A pooled analysis of two small studies (129 participants) suggests a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with constipation-predominant IBS at a short-term follow-up of two weeks.
<ABS> However both of the studies were carried out in the 1970s when the reporting of trials was not as comprehensive as it is now.
<ABS> These studies were subject to bias which makes it difficult to determine whether the benefit found in these studies are a true reflection of the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment.
<ABS> Further high quality RCTs enrolling larger numbers of patients are required to assess the effectiveness and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to placebo or usual care.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that leads to decreased health-related quality of life and work productivity.
<INT> Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review.
<INT> In clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition.
<INT> This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for treating IBS.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.
<MaM> We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three RCTs (213 participants) were included.
<RES> No cohort or case-control studies were identified.
<RES> Two studies published in 1976 and 1979 compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for constipation-predominant IBS.
<RES> One study published in 1990 compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female patients.
<RES> Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some criteria.
<RES> A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a short-term follow-up of two weeks.
<RES> Seventy-three per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18).
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and placebo.
<RES> Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15).
<RES> GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up and sparse data.
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20) for the outcome "feeling unwell", where the participant scored how "unwell" they felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22).
<RES> None of the included studies reported on adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with constipation-predominant IBS.
<CON> These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data.
<CON> One small study found no statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets advising a high fibre diet).
<CON> No conclusions can be drawn from this study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this trial.
<CON> In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was conducted.
<CON> Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to placebo or usual care.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Do treatments that act on the immune system have effects on idiopathic lumbosacral plexopathy (ILSP)?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> ILSP is an uncommon disorder of the peripheral nerves and lumbosacral plexus that causes asymmetrical pain and weakness of the lower limbs.
<ABS> The lumbosacral plexus is a network of nerves near the base of the spine.
<ABS> In ILSP, a process damages this nerve network, and changes in sensation can occur, such as tingling, and oversensitivity to touch.
<ABS> There may also be effects on the part of the nervous system that controls unconscious body functions (the autonomic nervous system).
<ABS> The cause or causes of ILSP are not clear, but it is thought that blood vessels become inflamed for reasons we do not yet know, and this reduces blood flow to the network of nerves.
<ABS> Some experts think that the reduced blood flow damages the nerves.
<ABS> It is possible that medication that reduces inflammation could be beneficial.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> After a wide search for high quality studies of treatment (randomized controlled trials, or similar), we found no trials in ILSP of any form of therapy that acts on the immune system or reduces inflammation.
<ABS> There is presently no evidence from any trial to show whether immunotherapies help people with ILSP.
<ABS> Database searches for this review were run on 15 October 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Idiopathic lumbosacral plexopathy (ILSP), also called lumbosacral plexitis or non-diabetic lumbosacral (radiculo)plexus neuropathy is a rare clinical entity.
<INT> ILSP generally runs a monophasic and self limiting course.
<INT> Recovery starts slowly over months to several years and is nearly always incomplete.
<INT> Some studies suggest that the condition has an immune-mediated etiology.
<INT> Biopsies of distal cutaneous nerve segments have shown features suggestive of an inflammatory microvasculitis causing ischemic damage of the nerves.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 15 October 2013, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Index to Theses.
<MaM> We scanned conference abstracts, and searched trials databases for ongoing trials.
<MaM> We checked all references in the identified trials and contacted authors to identify any additional published or unpublished data.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Many children and adolescents worldwide are overweight or obese.
<ABS> Children and adolescents who are overweight or obese have increased physical disease and emotional distress.
<ABS> They also perform less well on tests of thinking (cognitive ability), and they do less well in school.
<ABS> To prevent and treat obesity, several lifestyle changes have been suggested, for example, being more physically active, eating fewer calories and sitting less.
<ABS> These interventions are known to improve thinking skills and school achievement in children of normal weight.
<ABS> It is unknown whether the effects are the same in overweight or obese children and adolescents.
<ABS> The review authors searched for studies that evaluated school achievement, cognitive ability and later life achievement (e.g. income, employment) in overweight or obese children and adolescents randomly assigned to a lifestyle intervention (aiming to being more physically active and/or improving diet and/or sitting less) or a control condition (e.g. standard care, no treatment).
<ABS> We found six relevant studies with a total of 674 overweight and obese children.
<ABS> We found that, compared with standard school routine, school-based interventions targeting healthy diet and lifestyle education led to small improvements in overall school achievement in overweight or obese children.
<ABS> We also found that increasing physical activity improved scores on tests of mathematics and memory, and improved 'problem-solving' thinking skills.
<ABS> No clear evidence was found of an effect on other thinking skills related to reading, language or vocabulary.
<ABS> We found no studies that looked at whether lifestyle interventions affected achievements after leaving school.
<ABS> Overall, despite the large number of childhood obesity treatment studies, only a select few evaluated the effects of obesity treatment on school achievement and cognitive function.
<ABS> The existing studies are limited in quality but suggest that lifestyle interventions could benefit overweight and obese children specifically in overall school achievement, mathematics, memory and specific thinking skills.
<ABS> Health policy makers may wish to consider these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools.
<ABS> Future obesity treatment studies could consider academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence is high.
<INT> Lifestyle changes, including reduced caloric intake, decreased sedentary behaviour and increased physical activity, are recommended for prevention and treatment of child and adolescent obesity.
<INT> Evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children of normal weight.
<INT> Similar beneficial effects may be seen in overweight or obese children and adolescents.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In addition, we searched the Network Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), three trials registries and reference lists.
<MaM> We also contacted researchers in the field.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included (cluster) randomised and controlled clinical trials of lifestyle interventions for weight management in overweight or obese children three to 18 years of age.
<MaM> Studies in children with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed quality and risk of bias and cross-checked extracts to resolve discrepancies when required.
<MaM> Authors were contacted to obtain further study details and were asked to provide data on the overweight and obese study population when they were not reported separately.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of 529 screened full-text articles, we included in the review six studies (14 articles) of 674 overweight and obese children and adolescents, comprising four studies with multicomponent lifestyle interventions and two studies with physical activity only interventions.
<RES> We conducted a meta-analysis when possible and a sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of cluster-randomised controlled trials and/or studies at 'high risk' of attrition bias on the intervention effect.
<RES> We prioritised reporting of the sensitivity analysis when risk of bias and differences in intervention type and duration were suspected to have influenced the findings substantially.
<RES> Analysis of a single study indicated that school-based healthy lifestyle education combined with nutrition interventions can produce small improvements in overall school achievement (mean difference (MD) 1.78 points on a scale of zero to 100, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.76; P < 0.001; N = 321; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Single component physical activity interventions produced small improvements in mathematics achievement (MD 3.00 points on a scale of zero to 200, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.22; P value = 0.008; one RCT; N = 96; high-quality evidence), executive function (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, standard deviation (SD) 15, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.91; P value = 0.04; one RCT; N = 116) and working memory (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, SD 15, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.49; P value = 0.02; one RCT; N = 116).
<RES> No evidence suggested an effect of any lifestyle intervention on reading, vocabulary and language achievements, attention, inhibitory control and simultaneous processing.
<RES> Pooling of data in meta-analyses was restricted by variations in study design.
<RES> Heterogeneity was present within some meta-analyses and may have been explained by differences in types of interventions.
<RES> Risk of bias was low for most assessed items; however in half of the studies, risk of bias was detected for attrition, participant selection and blinding.
<RES> No study provided evidence of the effect of lifestyle interventions on future success.
<RES> Whether changes in academic and cognitive abilities were connected to changes in body weight status was unclear because of conflicting findings and variations in study design.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Despite the large number of childhood obesity treatment trials, evidence regarding their impact on school achievement and cognitive abilities is lacking.
<CON> Existing studies have a range of methodological issues affecting the quality of evidence.
<CON> Although the effects are small, a very large number of children and adolescents could benefit from these interventions.
<CON> Therefore health policy makers may wish to consider these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Needlestick injuries (NSIs) from devices used for blood collection or for injections expose healthcare workers to the risk of serious infections such as hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
<ABS> Safety features such as shields or retractable needles can help prevent these injuries.
<ABS> We wanted to find out how effective these devices are.
<ABS> We searched for studies in multiple databases until January 2012 for randomised (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS).
<ABS> Studies included in this review
<ABS> We included eight RCTs and 11 NRS.
<ABS> These studies evaluated the safety of blood collection systems, intravenous (IV) systems, injection systems, multiple devices and sharps containers.
<ABS> We estimated that the NSI rate in the control groups was one to five NSIs per 1000 person-years.
<ABS> The risk of bias was high in most studies.
<ABS> What does the research say?
<ABS> In one NRS study that evaluated safe blood collection systems, NSIs decreased right after the systems were put into use but there was no further decrease over time.
<ABS> There was very low quality evidence that NSIs reduced significantly using safe IV devices.
<ABS> However, there was moderate quality evidence in four other studies that these devices increased the number of blood splashes where the user had to switch on the safety system.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence that safe injection devices reduced the NSI rate in two studies.
<ABS> Using many safety devices showed a decrease in NSI in one study but not in another.
<ABS> Using safety containers showed a decrease in NSI in one study but inconsistent results in two studies.
<ABS> There was no evidence in the included studies about which type of device was better.
<ABS> So, for example, we do not know if it is safer to shield or retract a needle.
<ABS> What is the bottom line?
<ABS> We concluded that there is only very low quality, inconsistent evidence that most safety devices prevent needlestick injuries (NSIs).
<ABS> The risk of blood contamination is greater with devices that have to be actively switched on.
<ABS> The lack of a clear beneficial effect could be due to the high risk of bias in the studies.
<ABS> This does not mean that these devices are not effective.
<ABS> Cluster-randomised studies are needed to compare the various types of safety devices for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data.
<MaM> We synthesized study results with a fixed-effect or random-effects model meta-analysis where appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four RCTs with 1136 participants, two cluster-RCTs with 795 participants and 73,454 patient days, four CBAs with approximately 22,000 participants and seven ITS with an average of seven data points.
<RES> These studies evaluated safe modifications of blood collection systems, intravenous (IV) systems, injection systems, multiple devices and sharps containers.
<RES> The needlestick injury (NSI) rate in the control groups was estimated at about one to five NSIs per 1000 person-years.
<RES> There was only one study from a low- or middle-income country.
<RES> The risk of bias was high in most studies.
<RES> In one ITS study that evaluated safe blood collection systems, NSIs decreased immediately after the introduction (effect size (ES) -6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.5 to -4.2) and there was no clear evidence of an additional benefit over time (ES -1.2, 95% CI -2.5 to 0.1).
<RES> Another ITS study used an outdated recapping shield.
<RES> There was very low quality evidence that NSIs were reduced with the introduction of safe IV devices in two out of four studies but the other two studies showed no clear evidence of a trend towards a reduction.
<RES> However, there was moderate quality evidence in four other studies that these devices increased the number of blood splashes where the safety system had to be engaged actively (relative risk (RR) 1.6, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.36).
<RES> There was no clear evidence that the introduction of safe injection devices changed the NSI rate in two studies.
<RES> The introduction of multiple safety devices showed a decrease in NSI in one study but not in another.
<RES> The introduction of safety containers showed a decrease in NSI in one study but inconsistent results in two other studies.
<RES> There was no evidence in the included studies about which type of device was better, for example shielding or retraction of the needle.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> For safe blood collection systems, we found very low quality evidence in one study that these decrease needlestick injuries (NSIs).
<CON> For intravenous systems, we found very low quality evidence that they result in a decrease of NSI compared with usual devices but moderate quality evidence that they increase contamination with blood.
<CON> For other safe injection needles, the introduction of multiple safety devices or the introduction of sharps containers the evidence was inconsistent or there was no clear evidence of a benefit.
<CON> All studies had a considerable risk of bias and the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect could be due both to confounding and bias.
<CON> This does not mean that these devices are not effective.
<CON> Cluster-randomised controlled studies are needed to compare the various types of safety engineered devices for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low- and middle-income countries.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Modern contraception methods play an important role in global health, empowering women to avoid unintended pregnancy and thus reducing avoidable deaths and ill-health of mothers and babies related to unintended pregnancies.
<ABS> Hormonal methods are those in which women receive female sex hormones (progestogens with or without oestrogens), by mouth, injection, vaginal rings, skin patches, progestogen-containing intrauterine devices or devices implanted below the skin.
<ABS> It is known that monkeys treated with high doses of progestogen (higher than those used for contraception) are more likely to be infected with HIV.
<ABS> It is also known that hormonal contraception alters the systemic and local human immune system in ways which might increase susceptibility to HIV infection, and that progestogen contraception lowers the woman's own oestrogen levels causing thinning of the lining of the vagina.
<ABS> In some, but not all, observational studies, it was found that women using hormonal contraception (specifically DMPA) were more likely to acquire HIV.
<ABS> However, as these were not randomised trials, this effect might be related to the characteristics of women who choose to use hormonal contraception, rather than an effect of the contraceptive itself.
<ABS> This review found only one ongoing trial with no data available to date.
<ABS> There is thus no high quality evidence available as to whether or not hormonal contraception is associated with HIV acquisition.
<ABS> Because of the importance of hormonal contraception for women's health, no change in practice would be justified without such evidence.
<ABS> Appropriate randomised trials are needed to answer this important question.
<ABS> All women using non-barrier contraception should be advised that such contraception does not protect against HIV infection, and that they should take such precautions as are appropriate to their personal circumstances.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Concern about a possible association of hormonal contraception with HIV acquisition has been raised by three types of evidence.
<INT> Firstly, high-dose progestogen treatment greatly increases HIV acquisition in female non-human primates.
<INT> Secondly, biological plausibility for a link between hormonal contraception anf HIV acquisition is provided by evidence of a hypo-oestrogenic state induced by progestogen contraception with vaginal mucosal thinning, and evidence of effects on the humoral and cellular immune systems.
<INT> Thirdly, some but not other large observational studies have found an increase in HIV acquisition among women using hormonal contraception.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently no robust evidence from randomized trials on the possible effect of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death in the world, and in people younger than 40 years of age, it is the leading cause of death.
<ABS> Since the 2000s, computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in the trauma bay.
<ABS> It is more sensitive and specific than conventional radiography and ultrasonography.
<ABS> By the 2010s, with technical and infrastructural improvements, CT has evolved into a reliable and important method of diagnostic imaging in trauma.
<ABS> Blunt injury may occur following a direct impact (e.g. forced against a steering wheel or floor) or an indirect impact (e.g. acceleration-deceleration).
<ABS> It is difficult to identify which part of the body is injured following blunt injury and quick and accurate diagnoses are essential to reduce disability and death.
<ABS> The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS®) system is the most commonly used approach and involves a clinical examination and use of diagnostic methods that recognise the most life-threatening injuries that should be treated first.
<ABS> In the ATLS® approach, conventional diagnostic imaging is performed first (e.g. X-rays and focused abdominal sonography), followed by selective use of CT of specific body regions if required.
<ABS> In contrast, the use of routine thoracoabdominal (chest and abdomen) CT ensures that therapeutic decisions can be made based on detailed anatomical information of the injuries rather than clinical suspicion.
<ABS> This may lead to quicker and more accurate assessment of injuries present.
<ABS> Consequently, this may lead to improved outcomes.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched medical databases for publications of randomised controlled trials (a clinical study where participants are randomly allocated into treatment groups) comparing the usual approach versus selected use of CT scanning.
<ABS> We included studies of all types of blunt trauma and excluded studies with people with penetrating injuries (e.g. gunshot or knife wounds) and pregnant women.
<ABS> The searches are up-to-date to May 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no published or ongoing randomised controlled trials that compared routine versus selective thoracoabdominal CT in blunt-trauma patients.
<ABS> At this time, it is not possible to say which approach is better for patients, or reduces death.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and in people younger than 40 years of age, it is the leading cause of death.
<INT> It is currently unknown which of the two strategies is the better diagnostic strategy for patients with blunt high-energy trauma.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 4, 2013); MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP) and CINAHL for all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
<MaM> We did not restrict the searches by language, date or publication status.
<MaM> We conducted the search on the 9 May 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all blunt high-energy trauma patients (including blast or barotrauma).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently evaluated the search results.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The systematic search identified 481 references; after removal of duplicates, 396 remained.
<RES> We found no RCTs comparing routine versus selective thoracoabdominal CT in blunt high-energy trauma patients.
<RES> We excluded 381 studies based on the abstracts of the publications because of irrelevance to the review topic, and a further 15 studies after full-text evaluation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no RCTs of routine versus selective thoracoabdominal CT in patients with blunt high-energy trauma.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Optimal treatment of severe blunt pancreatic trauma in children has long been debated, some doctors advocate operation while others prefer a conservative approach without operation as primary treatment.
<ABS> We conducted this systematic review to assess which strategy should be preferred.
<ABS> Blunt trauma to the pancreas typically occurs after crashes involving a bicycle handlebar, road traffic crashes or other types of injury that cause a blow to the upper abdomen.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched medical databases for randomised (where two groups of children were randomly assigned to treatment or no treatment) clinical trials of children treated for blunt trauma to the pancreas by an operation or no operation.
<ABS> The children were aged 17 years or younger.
<ABS> The search was current to June 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomised clinical trials investigating operative treatment compared with non-operative treatment of severe pancreatic injury in children, hence we have no firm evidence to support either operative treatment or non-operative treatment of severe pancreatic lesions in children.
<ABS> Although difficult because of the rarity and the acute nature of these lesions, we recommend that multicentre randomised clinical trials of good quality are conducted.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pancreatic trauma in children is a serious condition with high morbidity.
<INT> Blunt traumatic pancreatic lesions in children can be treated non-operatively or operatively.
<INT> For less severe, grade I and II, blunt pancreatic trauma a non-operative or conservative approach is usually employed.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 5, 2013), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S) and ZETOC.
<MaM> In addition, we searched bibliographies of relevant articles, conference proceeding abstracts and clinical trials registries.
<MaM> We conducted the search on the 21 June 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used relevant search strategies to obtain the titles and abstracts of studies that were relevant for the review.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search found 83 relevant references.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review shows that strategies regarding non-operative versus operative treatment of severe blunt pancreatic trauma in children are not based on randomised clinical trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review aims to determine the current evidence on the impact of red blood cell transfusion on patients born with heart problems undergoing heart surgery.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Between four and nine children out of every 1000 born alive have hearts that have not formed properly.
<ABS> Heart surgery may allow a child to live and grow or may correct the defect in children and adults alike.
<ABS> Patients often need red blood cell transfusions during or after heart surgery.
<ABS> Most patients will have the surgery on a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine, which acts as the heart and lungs during the operation.
<ABS> More patients are now surviving heart surgery and the aim is to make surgery even safer.
<ABS> Some research suggests that red blood cell transfusions may make people more ill.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific sources to identify eligible trials and found 11 studies with 862 participants.
<ABS> We found no trials including adults.
<ABS> The identified studies examined three treatments: two trials compared giving a red blood cell transfusion only when the levels of haemoglobin in the blood fell below a certain concentration (known as a restrictive versus a liberal transfusion trigger); two trials compared whether there was a benefit to removing white blood cells (leukocytes) from the transfused red blood cells and seven trials compared methods used to prepare the fluid for the CPB machine.
<ABS> The trials were different in terms of the age of the participants, the type of heart disease and the exact treatment studied so there was been no opportunity to pool data for analysis.
<ABS> All studies did not report on all outcomes (a measure of a participant's clinical and functional status that is used to assess the effectiveness of a treatment, e.g. death, side effects).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Our primary outcome was death within 30 days after surgery.
<ABS> Five trials looked at this outcome and found no clear difference in mortality between the treatment arms.
<ABS> Four trials explored other adverse effects following a red blood cell transfusion.
<ABS> A difference in the number of adverse events was only observed for kidney failure: in one trial (with 309 participants), patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review identified only a few, small studies across three interventions.
<ABS> These studies measured many different aspects of red blood cell transfusion in patients having heart surgery so it is difficult to make accurate conclusions about the benefits or risks of red blood cell transfusion for these patients.
<ABS> More research is needed to allow accurate conclusions.
<ABS> Future studies should be bigger and focus on one aspect of transfusion in a specific type of heart disease.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Congenital heart disease is the most commonly diagnosed neonatal congenital condition.
<INT> Without surgery, only 30% to 40% of patients affected will survive to 10 years old.
<INT> Mortality has fallen since the 1990s with 2006 to 2007 figures showing surgical survival at one year of 95%.
<INT> Patients with congenital heart disease are potentially exposed to red cell transfusion at many points in the surgical pathway.
<INT> There are a number of risks associated with red cell transfusion that may be translated into increased patient morbidity and mortality.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched 11 bibliographic databases and three ongoing trials databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2013), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1950 to 11 June 2013), EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 11 June 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP and the ISRCTN Register (to June 2013).
<MaM> We also searched references of all identified trials, relevant review articles and abstracts from between 2006 and 2010 of the most relevant conferences.
<MaM> We did not limit the searches by language of publication.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing red cell transfusion interventions in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease.
<MaM> We included participants of any age (neonates, paediatrics and adults) and with any type of congenital heart disease (cyanotic or acyanotic).
<MaM> We excluded patients with congenital heart disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
<MaM> No co-morbidities were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 11 trials (862 participants).
<RES> All trials were in neonatal or paediatric populations.
<RES> The trials covered only three areas of interest: restrictive versus liberal transfusion triggers (two trials), leukoreduction versus non-leukoreduction (two trials) and standard versus non-standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime (seven trials).
<RES> Owing to the clinical diversity in the participant groups (cyanotic (three trials), acyanotic (four trials) or mixed (four trials)) and the intervention groups, it was not appropriate to pool data in a meta-analysis.
<RES> No study reported data for all the outcomes of interest to this review.
<RES> Risk of bias was mixed across the included trials, with only attrition bias being low across all trials.
<RES> Blinding of study personnel and participants was not always possible, depending on the intervention being used.
<RES> Five trials (628 participants) reported the primary outcome: 30-day mortality.
<RES> In three trials (a trial evaluating restrictive and liberal transfusion (125 participants), a trial of cell salvage during CPB (309 participants) and a trial of washed red blood cells during CPB (128 participants)), there was no clear difference in mortality at 30 days between the intervention arms.
<RES> In two trials comparing standard and non-standard CPB prime, there were no deaths in either randomised group.
<RES> Long-term mortality was similar between randomised groups in one trial each comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion or standard and non-standard CPB prime.
<RES> Four trials explored a range of adverse effects following red cell transfusion.
<RES> Kidney failure was the only adverse event that was significantly different: patients receiving cell salvaged red blood cells during CPB were less likely to have renal failure than patients not exposed to cell salvage (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.79, 1 study, 309 participants).
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between transfusion strategies for any other severe adverse events.
<RES> The duration of mechanical ventilation was measured in seven trials (768 participants).
<RES> Overall, there was no consistent difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the intervention and control arms.
<RES> The duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was measured in six trials (459 participants).
<RES> There was no clear difference in the duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms in the transfusion trigger and leukoreduction trials.
<RES> In the standard versus non-standard CPB prime trials, one trial examining the impact of washing transfused bypass prime red blood cells showed no clear difference in duration of ICU stay between the intervention arms, while the trial assessing ultrafiltration of the priming blood showed a shorter duration of ICU stay in the ultrafiltration group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There are only a small number of small and heterogeneous trials so there is insufficient evidence to assess the impact of red cell transfusion on patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery accurately.
<CON> It is possible that the presence or absence of cyanosis impacts on trial outcomes, which would necessitate different clinical management of two groups.
<CON> Further adequately powered, specific, high-quality trials are warranted to assess this fully.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Acute graft-versus-host disease is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplant of blood-forming stem cells).
<ABS> Immune cells (white blood cells) from the donor recognise the patient's cells as foreign ('non-self').
<ABS> Therefore, the transplanted immune cells attack the cells of the patient.
<ABS> The main affected organs are skin, liver and gut among other organ tissues.
<ABS> These immune reactions may cause acute inflammation followed by chronic changes of the organs (e.g. fibrosis).
<ABS> First-line therapy usually consists of immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in refractory cases (where the disease is resistant to treatment).
<ABS> The use of these immunosuppressive drugs is designed to suppress the immune-mediated attack of the patient's cells.
<ABS> Limited effectiveness and severe side effects of these immunosuppressive drugs have led to the application of several alternative approaches.
<ABS> Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that involves collection of immune cells from peripheral blood outside the person's body.
<ABS> These immune cells are then exposed to a photoactive agent (a chemical that responds to exposure to light; e.g. 8-methoxypsoralen) with subsequent ultraviolet-A radiation and then re-infused.
<ABS> The immunomodulatory effects of this procedure have not been completely elucidated.
<ABS> Several current clinical practice recommendations suggest consideration of ECP in paediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease after HSCT.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs; clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of acute graft-versus-host disease in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) after HSCT.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found no RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for paediatric patients with acute graft-versus-host disease after HSCT.
<ABS> Current recommendations are based on retrospective (a study in which the outcomes have occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational (a study in which the investigators do not seek to intervene, and simply observed the course of events) studies only.
<ABS> We recommend the use of ECP in paediatric patients after HSCT only in the context of RCTs.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute graft-versus host disease (aGvHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) occurring in 8% to 59% of the recipients.
<INT> Currently, the therapeutic mainstay for aGvHD is corticosteroids.
<INT> However, there is no established standard treatment for steroid-refractory aGvHD.
<INT> Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a type of immunomodulatory method amongst different therapeutic options that involves ex vivo collection of peripheral mononuclear cells, exposure to the photoactive agent 8-methoxypsoralen and ultraviolet-A radiation, and re-infusion of these treated blood cells to the patient.
<INT> The mechanisms of action of ECP are not completely understood

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 9, 2012), MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid) databases from their inception to 12 September 2012.
<MaM> We searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies without any language restriction.
<MaM> We searched eight trial registers and four conference proceedings.
<MaM> We also contacted an expert in the field to request information on unpublished study that involves ECP in aGvHD after HSCT.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed the study selection.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The efficacy of ECP in the treatment of aGvHD in paediatric patients after HSCT is unknown and its use should be restricted within the context of RCTs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Depression is a common mental disorder.
<ABS> It can present as loss of interest or pleasure, sadness, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of guilt or low self worth.
<ABS> In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that depression was the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years among all men and women between 15 and 44 years of age.
<ABS> The treatment of choice for severe and recurrent depression is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
<ABS> ECT involves the application of an electrical current to the patient's head.
<ABS> The aim is to induce a controlled convulsion.
<ABS> Patients usually undergo several sessions of ECT.
<ABS> To minimize adverse events and improve the quality of ECT, patients receive anaesthetic agents such as intravenous sedatives or hypnotics.
<ABS> These agents can influence the effectiveness of ECT but can cause potential adverse effects.
<ABS> It would be helpful to identify which is the best anaesthetic agent for ECT in this group of patients.
<ABS> This Cochrane review examined whether different types of anaesthetic agents could have an effect on anti-depression therapy and reported on the safety of those agents.
<ABS> The evidence is current to December 2012.
<ABS> We included in this review 18 randomized controlled trials (599 participants).
<ABS> We analysed nine pairs of comparisons: methohexital versus propofol; thiopental versus propofol; etomidate versus propofol; thiopental versus etomidate; etomidate versus methohexital; methohexital versus midazolam; thiopental versus midazolam; midazolam versus propofol; and thiamylal versus propofol.
<ABS> Our analysis revealed no difference in the reduction of depression scores when methohexital was compared with propofol.
<ABS> Propofol reduced seizure duration to a greater extent than methohexital.
<ABS> No difference in seizure duration was noted when thiopental was compared with propofol.
<ABS> Patients recovered faster from anaesthesia when propofol rather than thiopental was used.
<ABS> Adverse events related to anaesthesia induction agents and to the treatment for depression were not well reported in most trials.
<ABS> We found the quality of the evidence to be low.
<ABS> Larger well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed.
<ABS> More clinically relevant outcomes (such as remission of depressive symptoms and postanaesthetic adverse events) during a longer follow-up period should be reported in future studies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Depression is a common mental disorder.
<INT> It affects millions of people worldwide and is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be one of the leading causes of disability.
<INT> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established treatment for severe depression.
<INT> Intravenous anaesthetic medication is used to minimize subjective unpleasantness and adverse side effects of the induced tonic-clonic seizure.
<INT> The influence of different anaesthetic medications on the successful reduction of depressive symptoms and adverse effects is unclear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We handsearched related journals and applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cross-over trials evaluating the effects of different intravenous sedatives and hypnotics for ECT.
<MaM> We excluded studies and trials using placebo or inhalational anaesthetics and studies that used no anaesthetic.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included in the review 18 RCTs (599 participants; published between 1994 and 2012).
<RES> Most of the included trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> We analysed the results of studies comparing six different intravenous anaesthetics.
<RES> Only a few studies comparing propofol with methohexital (four studies) and with thiopental (three studies) could be pooled.
<RES> No difference was noted in the reduction of depression scores observed in participants treated with propofol compared with methohexital (low-quality evidence).
<RES> These four studies were not designed to detect differences in depression scores.
<RES> The duration of electroencephalograph (EEG) and of motor seizures was shorter in the propofol group compared with the methohexital group (low-quality evidence).
<RES> No difference was seen in EEG seizure duration when propofol was compared with thiopental (low-quality evidence).
<RES> Time to recovery (following commands) was longer among participants after anaesthesia with thiopental compared with propofol (low-quality evidence).
<RES> For the remaining comparisons of anaesthetics, only single studies or insufficient data were available.
<RES> Adverse events were inadequately reported in eligible trials, and none of the included trials reported anaesthesia-related mortality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Most of the included studies were at high risk of bias, and the quality of evidence was generally low.
<CON> The studies were not designed to detect clinically relevant differences in depression scores.
<CON> Anaesthetic agents should be chosen on the basis of adverse effect profile, emergence and how these medications affect seizure duration.
<CON> If it is difficult to elicit an adequately long seizure, methohexital may be superior to propofol (low-quality evidence).
<CON> If a patient is slow to recover from anaesthesia, propofol may allow a faster time to follow commands than thiopental (low-quality evidence).
<CON> A factor of clinical concern that was not addressed by any study was adrenal suppression from etomidate.
<CON> Optimal dosages of intravenous sedatives or hypnotics have not yet been determined.
<CON> Larger well-designed randomized studies are needed to determine which intravenous anaesthetic medication leads to the greatest improvement in depression scores with minimal adverse effects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is COPD?
<ABS> COPD is a common chronic respiratory disease mainly affecting people who smoke now or have done so previously.
<ABS> It could become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030.
<ABS> People with COPD experience gradually worsening shortness of breath and cough with sputum because of permanent damage to their airways and lungs.
<ABS> Those with COPD may have flare-ups (or exacerbations) that usually occur after respiratory infections.
<ABS> Exacerbations may lead to further irreversible loss of lung function with days off work, hospital admission, reduction in quality of life and they may even cause death.
<ABS> Why did we do this review?
<ABS> We wanted to find out if giving antibiotics to prevent a flare-up, 'prophylactic' antibiotics, would reduce the frequency of infections and improve quality of life.
<ABS> Studies that were taken into consideration used either continuous prophylactic antibiotics on a daily basis or prophylactic antibiotics that were used intermittently.
<ABS> What evidence did we find?
<ABS> We found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3170 patients.
<ABS> All studies were published between 2001 and 2011.
<ABS> Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis.
<ABS> The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin.
<ABS> On average, the people involved in the trials were 66 years old and had either moderate or severe COPD.
<ABS> Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two of the trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen.
<ABS> Results and conclusions
<ABS> We found that with the use of continuous daily antibiotics the number of patients who developed an exacerbation reduced markedly.
<ABS> For every eight patients treated, one person would be prevented from suffering an exacerbation.
<ABS> There may have been a benefit on patient-reported quality of life with the antibiotics.
<ABS> On the other hand, use of antibiotics did not significantly affect the number of deaths due to any cause, the frequency of hospitalisation, or the loss of lung function during the study period.
<ABS> Even though there may be fewer exacerbations with continuous antibiotics there are considerable drawbacks.
<ABS> First, there were specific adverse events associated with the antibiotics, which differed according to the antibiotic used; second, patients have to take antibiotics regularly for years or months; finally, the resulting increase in antibiotic resistance will have implications for both individual patients and the wider community through reducing the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics.
<ABS> Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant studies.
<MaM> The latest literature search was August 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Data were extracted and analysed by two independent review authors.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven RCTs involving 3170 patients were included in this systematic review.
<RES> All studies were published between 2001 and 2011.
<RES> Five studies were of continuous antibiotics and two studies were of intermittent antibiotic prophylaxis (termed 'pulsed' for this review).
<RES> The antibiotics investigated were azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin and moxifloxacin.
<RES> Azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin are macrolides while moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation synthetic fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent.
<RES> The study duration varied from three months to 36 months and all used intention-to-treat analysis.
<RES> Most of the results were of moderate quality.
<RES> The risk of bias of the included studies was generally low, and we did not downgrade the quality of evidence for risk of bias.
<RES> The trials recruited participants with a mean age of 66 years and with at least a moderate severity of COPD.
<RES> Three trials included participants with frequent exacerbations and two trials recruited participants requiring systemic steroids or antibiotics, or both, or who were at the end stage of their disease and required oxygen.
<RES> The primary outcomes for this review were the number of exacerbations and quality of life.
<RES> With use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics the number of patients experiencing an exacerbation was reduced (odds ratio (OR) 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77, 3 studies, 1262 participants, high quality).
<RES> This represented a reduction from 69% of participants in the control group compared to 54% in the treatment group (95% CI 46% to 63%) and the number needed to treat to prevent one exacerbation (NNTb) was therefore 8 (95% CI 5 to 18).
<RES> The frequency of exacerbations was also reduced with continuous prophylactic antibiotic treatment (rate ratio 0.73; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91).
<RES> Use of pulsed antibiotic treatment showed a non-significant reduction in the number of people with exacerbations (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.09, 1 study, 1149 participants, moderate quality) and the test for interaction showed that this result was significantly different from the effect on exacerbations with continuous antibiotics.
<RES> There was a statistically significant improvement in quality of life with both continuous and pulsed antibiotic treatment but this was smaller than the four unit improvement that is regarded as being clinically significant (MD -1.78; 95% CI -2.95 to -0.61, 2 studies, 1962 participants, moderate quality).
<RES> Neither pulsed nor continuous antibiotics showed a significant effect on the secondary outcomes of frequency of hospital admissions, change in lung function, serious adverse events or all-cause mortality (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The adverse events that were recorded varied among the trials depending on the different antibiotics used.
<RES> Azithromycin was associated with a significant hearing loss in the treatment group.
<RES> The moxifloxacin pulsed study reported a significantly higher number of adverse events in the treatment arm due to the marked increase in gastrointestinal adverse events (P < 0.001).
<RES> Some adverse events that led to drug discontinuation, such as development of long QTc or tinnitus, were not significantly more frequent in the treatment group than the placebo group but pose important considerations in clinical practice.
<RES> The development of antibiotic resistance in the community is of major concern.
<RES> One study found newly colonised patients to have higher rates of antibiotic resistance.
<RES> Patients colonised with moxifloxacin-sensitive pseudomonas at initiation of therapy rapidly became resistant with the quinolone treatment.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Use of continuous prophylactic antibiotics results in a clinically significant benefit in reducing exacerbations in COPD patients.
<CON> All trials of continuous antibiotics used macrolides hence the noted benefit applies only to the use of continuous macrolide antibiotics.
<CON> The impact of pulsed antibiotics remains uncertain and requires further research.
<CON> The trials in this review included patients who were frequent exacerbators and needed treatment with antibiotics or systemic steroids, or who were on supplemental oxygen.
<CON> There were also older individuals with a mean age of 66 years.
<CON> The results of these trials apply only to the group of patients who were studied in these trials and may not be generalisable to other groups.
<CON> Because of concerns about antibiotic resistance and specific adverse effects, consideration of prophylactic antibiotic use should be mindful of the balance between benefits to individual patients and the potential harms to society created by antibiotic overuse.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; i.e. chronic bronchitis or emphysema or both, also called "smoker's lung disease") is a disease in which patients (predominantly smokers) experience breathlessness and produce a lot of phlegm or sputum.
<ABS> COPD is diagnosed by using international guidelines provided by the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD).
<ABS> One of the treatments that may be used to slow down worsening of this disease consists of steroid inhalers.
<ABS> These inhalers are known as preventer inhalers because they are taken daily to prevent symptoms.
<ABS> GOLD recommends that steroid inhalers are now to be used only in combination with inhaled LABA drugs (long-acting beta2-agonists, e.g. formoterol).
<ABS> They are recommended for patients who have COPD with high risk of flare-ups ("exacerbations").
<ABS> Why do this review?
<ABS> It is still unsure whether these steroid preventer inhalers, such as beclometasone inhalers, make a difference to patients with COPD.
<ABS> Therefore we decided to do a systematic review of existing studies to look into the effects and side effects of beclometasone inhalers for people with COPD.
<ABS> Which questions does this review try to answer?
<ABS> How did this review do this?
<ABS> We searched all research papers of clinical trials on this topic and made a special effort to find unpublished trials.
<ABS> We compared effects on breathing ability, death rates, how often pneumonias and flare-ups happened, how often rescue inhalers had to be used, quality of life and side effects.
<ABS> The evidence obtained is up to date to February 2013.
<ABS> What were the results?
<ABS> For (A) we found two studies, with a total of 298 study participants.
<ABS> For (B) we found one study, with 474 study participants, all with severe (stage 3) COPD.
<ABS> For (A) we found no differences that could not be due to chance (not "statistically significant").
<ABS> Therefore we found no evidence that beclometasone is better or worse than placebo for COPD.
<ABS> It is possible that this conclusion is not fully informed, however, as we were able to use only one trial.
<ABS> We await further statistics from another trial, and we suspect that many trials addressing (A) have gone unpublished in the past.
<ABS> For (B) we found real differences in breathing capacity and rescue inhalers ("statistically significant"), but as the differences were small, they are unlikely to be noticeable for patients (not "clinically significant").
<ABS> We also found a real increase in the average rate of severe flare-ups of COPD requiring hospital admission when study participants were using steroid-containing inhalers.
<ABS> However, the trial authors showed that these differences could have been caused by different hospital policies in the many countries that participated.
<ABS> For the other aspects that we compared, we found no differences in benefits or harms; any differences found were so small that they could have been due to chance.
<ABS> Further research is being done in this area, and findings of these studies may change our conclusions in the future.
<ABS> Are there any criticisms of this review's results?
<ABS> Our conclusions are limited by the small number of studies that were useful (only three), the poor/average quality of the evidence and the fact that most of these studies apply only to patients with severe but very stable COPD.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic obstructive lung condition, diagnosed in patients with dyspnoea, chronic cough or sputum production and/or a history of risk factor exposure, if their postbronchodilator forced expiratory lung volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital lung capacity (FVC) ratio is less than 0.70, according to the international GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease) criteria.
<INT> Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medications are now recommended for COPD only in combination treatment with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), and only for patients of GOLD stage 3 and stage 4 severity, for both GOLD groups C and D.
<INT> ICS are expensive and how effective they are is a topic of controversy, particularly in relation to their adverse effects (pneumonia), which may be linked to more potent ICS.
<INT> It is unclear whether beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), an unlicensed but widely used inhaled steroid, is a safe and effective alternative to other ICS.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We contacted pharmaceutical companies and drug marketing authorisation bodies/ethics committees in 49 countries and obtained licensing information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Minimum trial duration is 12 weeks.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Inclusion, bias assessment and data extraction were conducted by two review authors independently.
<MaM> The analysis was performed by one review author.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted to obtain missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> For BDP versus placebo, two studies were included, of which one trial (participants n = 194) was included in the quantitative analysis.
<RES> This study was a very high-dose trial with stable stage 2 and 3 COPD participants.
<RES> No statistically significant results in change in lung function, mortality, exacerbations, dyspnoea scores or withdrawal were obtained.
<RES> The quality of the evidence of all these outcomes was graded low to very low.
<RES> Data on risk of pneumonia were lacking.
<RES> The main focus of the review was the more clinically relevant BDP/LABA versus LABA arm.
<RES> Therefore the findings are reported more fully.
<RES> For BDP/LABA versus LABA, one study (n = 474) was included, with a further ongoing study identified for future inclusion.
<RES> The included trial was a high-dose study of stable stage 3 COPD participants.
<RES> Compared with LABA, people receiving BDP/LABA showed a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 lung function measurements of 0.051 L (95% confidence Interval (CI) 0.001 to 0.102, P = 0.046) (high quality of evidence) and in (self-reported) days without rescue bronchodilators (mean difference 7.05, 95% CI 0.84 to 13.26, P = 0.03) (low quality), both of which are unlikely to be clinically significant.
<RES> Participants receiving BDP/LABA also had a statistically significant increased rate of exacerbations leading to hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.90, P = 0.008) (moderate quality), although this finding is debatable as this study's post hoc analysis showed no statistically significant difference when accounting for country-specific differences in hospitalisation policies.
<RES> We did not find statistically significant differences for mortality (very low quality), pneumonia (low quality), exacerbations, exercise capacity, quality of life and dyspnoea scores, adverse events and withdrawal (all moderate quality).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found little evidence to suggest that beclometasone is a safer or more effective treatment option for people with COPD when compared with placebo or when used in combination with LABA; when statistically significant differences were found, they mostly were not clinically meaningful or were based on data from only one study.
<CON> The review was limited by an inability to obtain data from one study and likely publication bias for BDP versus placebo, and by the inclusion of one study only for BDP/LABA versus LABA.
<CON> An ongoing study of BDP/LABA versus LABA may have a further impact on these conclusions.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Implementation of treatment guidelines in mental health care

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> During the past few decades, a wide range of therapies and interventions for mental health have been developed that have been supported by research and randomised evidence.
<ABS> This includes research evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments (such as antipsychotic drugs) and psychological therapies (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, family therapy and psychoeducation).
<ABS> However, research evidence is not easily translated into practice and the everyday working of healthcare services.
<ABS> A huge gap exists between the production of research evidence (what is known) and its uptake in healthcare settings (what is done).
<ABS> Better uptake of research evidence can be achieved by increasing awareness that such evidence exists.
<ABS> One method of encouraging better uptake is the use of treatment guidelines based on assessments of research evidence.
<ABS> Treatment guidelines are now commonly employed in healthcare settings, including those providing treatment for schizophrenia.
<ABS> It remains unclear, however, whether treatment guidelines have any positive impact on the performance of mental health services or whether they improve outcomes for patients (such as better quality of life, improved mental state, employment and fewer admissions to hospital).
<ABS> This review is based on a search carried out in March 2012 and includes five studies.
<ABS> The review examines the effectiveness of guideline implementation strategies in improving healthcare services and outcomes for people with mental illness.
<ABS> However, with such a small number of studies, and with all main results graded by review authors as providing very low quality evidence, it is not possible to arrive at concrete and definite conclusions.
<ABS> Although single studies provided initial evidence that implementation of treatment guidelines may achieve small changes in mental health practice, a gap in knowledge still exists about how this might improve patient outcomes and health services.
<ABS> This leaves scant information for people with mental health problems, health professionals and policy makers.
<ABS> More large-scale, well-designed and well-conducted studies are necessary to fill this gap in knowledge.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray: Service User and Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A huge gap exists between the production of evidence and its take-up in clinical practice settings.
<INT> To fill this gap, treatment guidelines, based on explicit assessments of the evidence base, are commonly employed in several fields of medicine, including schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors worked independently and in duplicate to critically appraise records from 882 studies; five individual studies met the inclusion criteria and were considered.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the five included studies, practitioner impact was assessed in three.
<RES> The five studies were generally at unclear risk of bias, and all evidence in the 'Summary of findings' table was graded by review authors as of very low quality.
<RES> Meta-analysis of two studies revealed that a combination of several guideline dissemination and implementation strategies targeting healthcare professionals did not reduce antipsychotic co-prescribing in schizophrenia outpatients (two studies, n = 1,082, risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99 to 1.23; corrected for cluster design: n = 310, RR 0.97, CI 0.75 to 1.25).
<RES> Regarding participant outcomes, one trial assessed the efficacy of a shared decision-making implementation strategy and found no impact in terms of psychopathology, satisfaction with care and drug attitude.
<RES> Another single trial studied a multifaceted intervention to promote medication adherence and found no impact in terms of adherence rates.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> With only five studies meeting inclusion criteria, and with limited low or very low quality usable information, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Anaesthetic regimens for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anaesthetic regimens for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Approximately 50 to 250 out of every 1000 adults in the western world have gallstones.
<ABS> Of every 100 people with gallstones, two to four people develop symptoms such as pain in the upper abdomen.
<ABS> This condition is treated by surgical removal of the gallbladder through 'keyhole surgery', a procedure that is known as laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> It is possible to perform the operation and allow the patient to go home on the same day ('day surgery').
<ABS> During surgery, the patient is given a range of medicines to provide lack of awareness of the procedure undertaken, reduce pain, and relax muscles (allowing the surgeon adequate access and vision).
<ABS> Together, this is called an anaesthetic regimen.
<ABS> Many different anaesthetic regimens have been suggested for use in day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
<ABS> We sought to find the best anaesthetic regimen by performing a thorough search of the literature for randomized controlled trials, reported until November 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 11 trials involving 1069 patients in this review.
<ABS> Most participants in the trials had a low anaesthetic risk.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There were no deaths or serious complications in the only trial that reported this information.
<ABS> Overall, 85% of patients (472/554) were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients and 2% of patients (1/60) required hospital readmission.
<ABS> The reasons for not discharging the patients as day-procedure patients were not described in detail in the trials.
<ABS> The reason for readmission was fever that developed in the patient and which subsequently settled on its own without any treatment.
<ABS> Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of a difference in the measures of pain intensity between any of the comparisons.
<ABS> Time to return to routine daily activity and to return to work were not reported in any of the trials.
<ABS> There is currently no evidence to support one anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy over another.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All the trials had elements that tended to reduce our trust in the accuracy of the results.
<ABS> Few patients were included in each comparison resulting in a considerable chance of arriving at erroneous conclusions.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Randomized controlled trials designed to minimize the risk of arriving at wrong conclusions are necessary to determine the best anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, one of the commonest procedures performed in the western world.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Day surgery involves admission of selected patients to hospital for a planned surgical procedure with the patients returning home on the same day.
<INT> An anaesthetic regimen usually involves a combination of an anxiolytic, an induction agent, a maintenance agent, a method of maintaining the airway (laryngeal mask versus endotracheal intubation), and a muscle relaxant.
<INT> The effect of anaesthesia may continue after the completion of surgery and can delay discharge.
<INT> Various regimens of anaesthesia have been suggested for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 11 trials involving 1069 participants at low anaesthetic risk.
<RES> The sample size varied from 40 to 300 participants.
<RES> We included 23 comparisons.
<RES> All trials were at a high risk of bias.
<RES> We were unable to perform a meta-analysis because there were no two trials involving the same comparison.
<RES> Primary outcomes included perioperative mortality, serious morbidity and proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day.
<RES> There were no perioperative deaths or serious adverse events in either group in the only trial that reported this information (0/60).
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients who were discharged on the same day between any of the comparisons.
<RES> Overall, 472/554 patients (85%) included in this review were discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients.
<RES> Secondary outcomes included hospital readmissions, health-related quality of life, pain, return to activity and return to work.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference in hospital readmissions within 30 days in the only comparison in which this outcome was reported.
<RES> One readmission was reported in the 60 patients (2%) in whom this outcome was assessed.
<RES> Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference in the pain intensity, measured by a visual analogue scale, between comparators in the only trial which reported the pain intensity at between four and eight hours after surgery.
<RES> Times to return to activity and return to work were not reported in any of the trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that one anaesthetic regimen for day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be preferred over another.

<H1> Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Cognitive behavioural therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of research about the effects of cognitive-behavioural therapies (CBTs) on fibromyalgia (FM).
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, they found 23 studies with up to 2031 people.
<ABS> Their findings are summarised below.
<ABS> After about 12 weeks, children, adolescents and adults with FMS, who used CBTs compared to controls, were likely to report that CBT
<ABS> - may reduce slightly pain, negative mood and disability at the end of the treatment;
<ABS> - may reduce slightly pain, negative mood and disability six months after the end of treatment.
<ABS> There was no difference between CBTs and controls in the number of people who withdrew from treatment.
<ABS> We do not have precise information about side effects and complications of CBTs.
<ABS> Rare complications may include worsening of co-existing mental disorders.
<ABS> What is fibromyalgia and what are cognitive behavioural therapies?
<ABS> People with FM suffer from chronic widespread pain, sleep problems and fatigue.
<ABS> There is no cure for FM at present, so treatments aim to relieve symptoms and to improve daily functioning.
<ABS> Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) are widely used psychological treatments for a wide range of health problems, including chronic pain.
<ABS> CBTs are effective in enhancing patients’ beliefs in their own abilities and developing ways to deal with health problems.
<ABS> The primary goals of CBTs are to change negative thoughts and feelings that individuals may have of their physical and mental problems and to change their behaviour accordingly.
<ABS> Patients learn skills (for example, relaxation, activity pacing) to help them to manage their pain better or develop different attitudes towards pain (for example, more acceptance), or both.
<ABS> Best estimates of what happens to people with FMS when they use CBTs
<ABS> Pain (higher scores mean worse or more severe pain):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their pain to be 0.5 points lower at the end of treatment (6.3% absolute improvement) and to be 0.6 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (4.2% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rates their pain to be 6.9 points on a scale of 0-10.
<ABS> - People who used a control treatment rated their pain to be 7.4 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Negative mood (higher scores mean worse or more severe negative mood):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their depressed mood to be 0.7 points lower at the end of treatment (10.2% absolute improvement) and to be 1.3 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (2.7% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their negative mood to be 6.1 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who had a control treatment rated their negative mood to be 6.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Disability (higher scores mean more disability):
<ABS> - People who used CBTs rated their disability to be 0.7 points lower at the end of treatment (7.2% absolute improvement) and to be 1.2 points lower six months after the end of treatment on a scale of 0 to 10 (11.7% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - Peope who used CBTs rated their disability to be 2.0 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - People who used a control treatment rated their disability to be 2.8 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> Withdrawing from treatment:
<ABS> - The number of people who withdrew from CBTs compared to control interventions due to any reason was equal.
<ABS> - 15 people out of 100 who used CBTs withdrew from treatment due to any reason;
<ABS> - 15 people out of 100 who used control interventions withdrew from treatment due to any reason.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterized by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction and fatigue.
<INT> Patients often report high disability levels and negative mood.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1966 to 28 August 2013), PsycINFO (1966 to 28 August 2013) and SCOPUS (1980 to 28 August 2013).
<MaM> We searched http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (web site of the US National Institutes of Health) and the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials (last search 28 August,2013), and the reference lists of reviewed articles.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The data of all included studies were extracted and the risks of bias of the studies were assessed independently by two review authors.
<MaM> Discrepancies were resolved by discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-three studies with 24 study arms with CBTs were included.
<RES> A total of 2031 patients were included; 1073 patients in CBT groups and 958 patients in control groups.
<RES> Only two studies were without any risk of bias.
<RES> The GRADE quality of evidence of the studies was low.
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in dropout rates for any reasons between CBTs and controls (risk ratio (RR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.35).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The dropout rates due to any reason did not differ between CBTs and controls.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Dexmedetomidine for the management of awake fibreoptic intubation

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This is a review of the clinical evidence from randomized controlled trials on the effect of dexmedetomidine in the management of awake fibreoptic intubation.
<ABS> The review was conducted by researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration.
<ABS> Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) is indicated for the management of patients with a difficult or unstable (critical) airway, such as those with airway deformity or tumour, airway injury or spinal cord instability.
<ABS> It is necessary in such a situation to maintain patient co-operation and reduce patient anxiety without causing severe adverse effects during the AFOI.
<ABS> Many agents, including fentanyl, remifentanil, midazolam and propofol, have been reported to assist with AFOI.
<ABS> However, these agents can cause respiratory arrest, loss of airway control or reduced cardiovascular (heart) function, especially when used in high doses, thus increasing the risk of low oxygen levels (hypoxaemia), aspiration, low blood pressure (hypotension) or slow heart rate (bradycardia).
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist that can cause sedation, anxiolysis, analgesic sparing, reduced salivary secretion and minimal respiratory depression; this might be beneficial for patients with a difficult or unstable airway undergoing AFOI.
<ABS> We searched the medical literature until May 2012 and identified four randomized controlled trials involving 211 patients that were appropriate for inclusion in the review.
<ABS> These studies compared dexmedetomidine versus midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo for patients undergoing AFOI.
<ABS> We reran our search in November 2013, and four studies are awaiting assessment.
<ABS> We will deal with them when we update the review.
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced patient discomfort during AFOI compared with control groups in two included trials.
<ABS> No significant differences in intubation time, airway obstruction, low oxygen levels or treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events were reported during AFOI between the dexmedetomidine group and the control group.
<ABS> Dexmedetomidine did not appear to be inferior to other medications.
<ABS> The data from this evidence database of modest size provide limited evidence to support the use of dexmedetomidine as an alternative or primary choice for AFOI.
<ABS> Further research should focus on this important topic.
<ABS> Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to test the exact benefits of dexmedetomidine in the management of AFOI.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) frequently requires sedation, anxiolysis and relief of discomfort without impairing ventilation and depressing cardiovascular function.
<INT> The goal is to allow the patient to be responsive and co-operative.
<INT> Dexmedetomidine has been proposed as an alternative to facilitate AFOI.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched for ongoing trials at http://www.controlledtrials.com/ and http://clinicaltrials.gov/ .
<MaM> We reran our search of all databases listed above on 21 November 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Participants received dexmedetomidine or control medications.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions and outcomes.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included 211 participants.
<RES> The four trials compared dexmedetomidine with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo, respectively.
<RES> The trials showed low or unclear risk of bias primarily because information provided on allocation concealment and other potential sources of bias was inadequate.
<RES> Owing to clinical heterogeneity and potential methodological heterogeneity, it was impossible to conduct a full meta-analysis.
<RES> We described findings from individual studies or presented them in tabular form.
<RES> Limited evidence was available for assessment of the outcomes of interest for this review.
<RES> Results of the limited included trials showed that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced participants' discomfort with no significant differences in airway obstruction, low oxygen levels or treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events noted during AFOI compared with control groups.
<RES> When the search was rerun (from May 2012 to November 2013), it was noted that four studies are awaiting assessment.
<RES> We will deal with these studies when we update the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The findings of this review should be further corroborated by additional controlled investigations.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects a persons thoughts, perceptions and emotions.
<ABS> Family interventions have been shown to improve outcomes for people with schizophrenia and are now widely used.
<ABS> Brief family intervention is a form of family intervention where a mental health professional educates the person with schizophrenia and their family members about the illness over a limited number of sessions.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray, from RETHINK.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (July 2012), which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO.
<MaM> We inspected references of all identified studies for further trials.
<MaM> We contacted authors of trials for additional information.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We reliably selected studies, quality assessed them and extracted data.
<MaM> For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> For continuous outcomes, we estimated a mean difference (MD) between groups and their 95% CIs.
<MaM> We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence for main outcomes of interest and created a 'Summary of findings' table.
<MaM> We assessed risk of bias for included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies randomising 163 people could be included in the review.
<RES> Data for relapse are also equivocal by medium term (n = 40, 1 RCT, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.43, low quality evidence).
<RES> However, data for the family outcome of understanding of family member significantly favoured brief family intervention (n = 70, 1 RCT, MD 14.90, 95% CI 7.20 to 22.60, very low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported data for other outcomes of interest including days in hospital; adverse events; medication compliance; quality of life or satisfaction with care; or any economic outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The findings of this review are not outstanding due to the size and quality of studies providing data; the analysed outcomes were also minimal, with no meta-analysis possible.
<CON> All outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table were rated low or very low quality evidence.
<CON> However, the importance of brief family intervention should not be dismissed outright, with the present state of demand and resources available.
<CON> The designs of such brief interventions could be modified to be more effective with larger studies, which may then have enough power to inform clinical practice.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatments for fingertip entrapment injuries in children

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fingertip entrapment injuries commonly happen in children when their fingertip is caught between the door and the door surround as the door closes.
<ABS> This damages the finger nail, surrounding tissue and bone, all of which are important structures in the protection of the fingertip and for nail growth.
<ABS> These injuries are also called trapped finger injuries, crush fingertip injuries or door jamb injuries.
<ABS> Sometimes these injuries are treated without surgery ('conservatively') by cleaning them and dressing the wound.
<ABS> Alternatively, the injuries are treated with surgery, which typically involves a general anaesthetic, cleaning of the wound and removal of damaged tissue, and stitches to repair any cuts on the fingertip or the nail.
<ABS> We searched the medical literature until 30 April 2013 for studies comparing different methods of treating fingertip entrapment injuries.
<ABS> Our review includes evidence from two studies where participants were randomly allocated to one of two conditions.
<ABS> The studies included 191 children with results available for a total of 180 children.
<ABS> Both the studies had weaknesses that could undermine the reliability of the results.
<ABS> Since the studies compared different methods, we could not combine their results.
<ABS> One study looked at the routine use of antibiotics in children with a surgically repaired fingertip injury to prevent infection.
<ABS> Due to the small number of children experiencing infection this study does not provide conclusive evidence of the effect of giving or withholding antibiotics.
<ABS> Only one child in each group had an infection after a week.
<ABS> Both children had had more severe injuries.
<ABS> The other study compared two different dressing types for use in fingertip entrapment injuries.
<ABS> The low number of complications was comparable in the two treatment groups.
<ABS> Due to the low number of participants in the study we could not be certain that length of time the injuries took to heal and the number of dressing changes were the same in the treatment groups.
<ABS> However, it also found that the dressing made of silicone caused less distress for the child when being changed after the first week, probably because it stuck less to the wound than the paraffin dressing.
<ABS> Overall, there is not enough evidence about how to best treat fingertip entrapment injuries in children.
<ABS> We recommend that further research is carried out, especially to see if surgery leads to better outcomes than simple wound cleaning and dressing.
<ABS> These studies should evaluate the effect of the treatment on fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months after treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Treatment is either conservative (wound cleaning and fingertip dressing) or surgical (repair of lacerations, reduction and stabilisation of fractures); however, no consensus currently exists regarding the most appropriate treatment modality.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical and conservative interventions for fingertip entrapment injuries in children.
<OBJ> We aimed to compare: different methods of conservative treatment; surgical versus conservative treatment; different methods of surgical treatment; and different methods of management after initial conservative or surgical treatment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform and reference lists of articles up to 30 April 2013.
<MaM> We did not apply any restrictions based on language or publication status.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing interventions for treating fingertip entrapment injuries in children.
<MaM> The primary outcomes were fingertip function, nail growth, nail deformity and adverse events such as infection.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in each included trial and extracted data.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements through discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two RCTs examining a total of 191 young children, 180 of whom were included in the analyses.
<RES> The two trials tested different comparisons.
<RES> Both trials were at high risk of bias, particularly from lack of blinding of participants and personnel, and of outcome assessment.
<RES> The trials did not record fingertip function, nail growth or nail deformity.
<RES> The quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes was judged to be 'low' using the GRADE approach (i.e. further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of the effect and is likely to change the estimate).
<RES> One trial compared a seven-day course of antibiotics with no antibiotics after formal surgical repair of fingertip entrapment injuries.
<RES> One child in each group had an infection at day seven (1/66 antibiotic group versus 1/69 no antibiotic group; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.37).
<RES> Both participants with infections had a more severe injury (partial fingertip amputation).
<RES> The other trial compared two different dressings (silicone net and paraffin gauze) for use after either surgical or initial conservative management of fingertip entrapment injuries.
<RES> It reported that two of 20 children in the silicone group versus one of 25 in the paraffin group had complications of wound infection (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 25.63) and that one of 20 children in the silicone group versus two of 25 in the paraffin group had skin necrosis (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.41).
<RES> All complications healed with conservative treatment.
<RES> The results for mean healing times and mean number of dressing changes were similar between groups but benefits of either silicone or paraffin dressings could not be excluded (silicone mean 4.1 weeks versus paraffin mean 4.0 weeks; MD 0.10 weeks, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.81); (silicone mean 4.3 dressing changes versus paraffin mean 4.2 dressing changes; MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.77).
<RES> The trial found that a silicone dressing was less likely to adhere to the wound or cause distress for the child at the one-week dressing change.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is a lack of evidence from RCTs to inform all key treatment decisions for the management of fingertip entrapment injuries in children.
<CON> Given that the quality of evidence is low from one trial, we do not have conclusive evidence that prophylactic use of antibiotics after surgical repair fails to reduce risk of infection.
<CON> The two children who experienced infection had more severe wounds.
<CON> Similarly, the low quality evidence from one trial has not enabled us to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect on healing time or complications (infection, skin necrosis) at four-week follow-up between a silicone net dressing and a paraffin gauze dressing when applied post-surgery or after simple wound irrigation; however, the silicone net dressing may be easier to remove in the first week.
<CON> Further RCTs are required in this area, preferably comparing surgical with conservative methods of managing fingertip entrapment injuries.
<CON> Outcome assessment should include fingertip function, nail growth and nail deformity for a minimum of three months post treatment.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Photodynamic therapy for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Photodynamic therapy for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a condition of the mucosal lining of the upper airway, which leads to multiple benign, wart-like growths (papilloma).
<ABS> Although not cancerous, it can lead to serious problems, including hoarseness and airway obstruction.
<ABS> The main treatment is repeated surgical removal of the papilloma using a laser or cutting instrument.
<ABS> However, multiple surgical procedures carry the risk of complications and can also result in long-term scarring.
<ABS> Photodynamic therapy works through the application of a light-sensitising substance, which is then activated by light of a specific wavelength.
<ABS> A chemical reaction creates powerful active molecules that destroy the papilloma locally.
<ABS> It can be used on its own or as an additional treatment together with surgical removal.
<ABS> It has been proposed that photodynamic therapy slows the growth of the papilloma and results in fewer recurrences and therefore fewer surgical procedures.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We found one randomised controlled trial with a total of 23 participants for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> The study took place at two centres in the USA.
<ABS> Six of the 23 patients did not complete the study (dropped out).
<ABS> Participants who completed the study were outpatients, their age range was four to 60 years and 76% were men and 24% women.
<ABS> The study did not measure any of the outcomes important to patients (symptom improvement - respiratory distress/dyspnoea and voice quality, quality of life improvement and recurrence-free interval).
<ABS> It did measure the reduction in the volume of disease (assessed with an endoscope).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found insufficient evidence from the included study that photodynamic therapy has a benefit on its own or in combination with surgery in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence that effects observed in the treatment group were different to those in the control group.
<ABS> Adverse effects reported included airway swelling in a child with severe disease a few hours after photodynamic therapy, which required insertion of a breathing tube and a prolonged stay in hospital.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence is very low: there was no blinding of treatment and a high rate of drop-out.
<ABS> This evidence is up to date to January 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a benign condition of the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract.
<INT> It is characterised by recurrent papillomatous lesions and is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).
<INT> Frequent recurrence and rapid papilloma growth are common and in part responsible for the onset of potentially life-threatening symptoms.
<INT> Photodynamic therapy introduces a light-sensitising agent, which is administered either orally or by injection.
<INT> This substance (called a photo-sensitiser) is selectively retained in hyperplastic and neoplastic tissue, including papilloma.
<INT> It is then activated by light of a specific wavelength and may be used as a sole or adjuvant treatment for RRP.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the search was 27 January 2014.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials utilising photodynamic therapy as sole or adjuvant therapy in participants of any age with proven RRP versus control intervention.
<MaM> Primary outcome measures were symptom improvement (respiratory distress/dyspnoea and voice quality), quality of life improvement and recurrence-free interval.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included reduction in the frequency of surgical intervention, reduction in disease volume and adverse effects of treatment.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Meta-analysis was not possible and results are presented descriptively.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one trial with a total of 23 participants.
<RES> This study was at high risk of bias.
<RES> None of our primary outcomes and only one of our secondary outcomes (reduction in volume of disease, assessed endoscopically) was measured in the study.
<RES> There was no significant difference between the groups (very low-quality evidence).
<RES> Adverse effects reported included airway swelling requiring intubation in a child with severe RRP a few hours after photodynamic therapy.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence from high-quality randomised controlled trials to determine whether photodynamic therapy alters the course of disease or provides an added benefit to surgery in patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.
<CON> Multicentre randomised controlled trials with appropriate sample sizes and long-term follow-up are required to evaluate whether photodynamic therapy is of benefit.
<CON> Outcomes such as improvement in symptoms (respiratory function and voice quality) and quality of life should be measured in future trials.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV-1 infection

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in children with HIV-1 infection

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Using ART and chemotherapy together increases the likelihood of KS remission and reduces the risk of death in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS.
<ABS> We found four observational studies that examined this question.
<ABS> The quality of this evidence is, however, weak.
<ABS> Future clinical trials of KS treatment options in HIV-infected children are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Kaposi sarcoma (KS) remains the second most frequently diagnosed HIV-related malignancy (HRM) worldwide and most common HRM in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is most prevalent and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the precipitating agent for the development of KS, is endemic.
<INT> The majority of KS patients would likely benefit from systemic chemotherapy in addition to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
<INT> However, as paediatric staging and treatment criteria are not readily available, there are no uniform treatment criteria.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Abstracts of all studies identified by electronic or bibliographic scanning were examined independently by two authors.
<MaM> We initially identified 920 references and examined 15 in detail for study eligibility.
<MaM> Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> After initially screening 920 titles, 15 full-text articles were closely examined by two authors.
<RES> We identified four cohort studies that met our inclusion criteria for data extraction, coding, and potential meta-analysis.
<RES> Using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias assessments, all observational studies had cohorts that were representative of average (treated and untreated) HIV-infected children with Kaposi sarcoma.
<RES> For all outcomes of interest, no study adjusted for any other potential confounders.
<RES> Two of four observational studies either explicitly described complete follow up of the study participants and/or described the characteristics of the participants lost to follow up.
<RES> The use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus ART alone appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS, although data are sparse and not adequately adjusted for staging of disease and comorbidities.
<RES> Additionally, though data are sparse, the use of ART together with a chemotherapeutic regimen versus chemotherapy alone in some analyses appears to increase the likelihood of KS remission and reduce the risk of death in HIV-infected children diagnosed with KS.
<RES> In this analysis, we found that the quality of evidence was very low due to small sample sizes and a paucity of paediatric literature.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Data describing the efficacy of different treatment options for pediatric KS, to include chemotherapy and ART, are sparse.
<CON> However, the use of ART together with a chemotherapy regimen may be superior to the use of ART alone or of chemotherapy alone.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in the Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review to evaluate the effect of approaches to encourage health workers to work in particular healthcare facilities.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, they were unable to find any studies that met their requirements for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many countries have a severe lack of health workers.
<ABS> In addition, the health workers that are available are often not distributed in the best possible way.
<ABS> Most health workers work in urban areas, leaving rural areas underserved.
<ABS> Problems also occur in urban areas as health workers here often prefer to work in the private healthcare sector, which is often too expensive for many people.
<ABS> In rural areas, governments may not have built health facilities and the only available health care in these areas may, therefore, be private.
<ABS> However, private facilities in rural areas are not only expensive but may also struggle to attract qualified health workers.
<ABS> To address these problems, governments need to find ways of ensuring that more health workers work in the areas and facilities where most people seek care.
<ABS> This might, for instance, involve encouraging health workers to work in public healthcare facilities in towns and cities or to work in public or private facilities in rural areas.
<ABS> One approach governments could take is to give extra incentives to health workers serving in particular facilities.
<ABS> These incentives could include higher salaries, special allowances, or higher retirement packages.
<ABS> Another approach is to give health workers bursaries or scholarships during training on the condition that they work in particular facilities for a fixed period of time after they have finished their training.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Although these types of approaches are not uncommon, the review could not find any relevant studies that gave a reliable assessment of their impact.
<ABS> There is still a lot of work to be done to understand how governments can ensure that health workers serve in those health facilities that care for the majority of the population.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Health workers move between public and private organizations in both urban and rural areas during the course of their career.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Interventions included payment of special allowances, increasing salaries, bonding health workers, offering bursary schemes, scholarships or lucrative terminal benefits, and hiring people on contract basis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently applied the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies to the titles and abstracts of all articles obtained from the search.
<MaM> The same two review authors independently screened the full reports of the selected citations.
<MaM> At each stage, we compared the results and resolved discrepancies through discussion with a third review author.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We identified no rigorous studies on the effects of interventions to manage the movement of health workers between public and private organizations in low- and middle-income countries.
<CON> Health worker availability is a key obstacle in delivery of health services.
<CON> Interventions to make the health sector more responsive to the expectations of populations by having more health workers in the sector that serves most people would contribute to the more efficient use of the health workforce.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We reviewed evidence on the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy in supporting children's breathing.
<ABS> We found 11 studies in children.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> HFNC therapy delivers a mixture of air and oxygen via tubing that sits just inside the nostrils.
<ABS> For children hospitalized with breathing difficulties caused by conditions such as pneumonia or trauma or after surgery, HFNC therapy may help to support their breathing.
<ABS> This may reduce the need for other forms of breathing support such as life support.
<ABS> HFNC therapy can be used within the hospital ward setting, the emergency department or the intensive care unit.
<ABS> This Cochrane review is important because it assesses available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of HFNC compared with other forms of respiratory support, to help inform clinicians caring for children with breathing difficulties.
<ABS> Search date
<ABS> We searched medical databases from the 1950s until April 2013.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included studies on children from four weeks to 16 years of age.
<ABS> We searched for randomized controlled trials; however we excluded studies involving infants with bronchiolitis (a respiratory illness affecting infants that typically mimics a common cold) because children with this condition are included in another Cochrane review.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found 11 studies involving children; however none matched our criteria.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> It is important that good-quality studies are completed to identify indications as to the use and effectiveness of HFNC therapy in supporting the breathing of ill children.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Respiratory support is a central component of the management of critically ill children.
<INT> It can be delivered invasively via an endotracheal tube or non-invasively via face mask, nasal mask, nasal cannula or oxygen hood/tent.
<INT> Invasive ventilation can be damaging to the lungs, and the tendency to use non-invasive forms is growing.
<INT> However, non-invasive delivery is often poorly tolerated by children.
<INT> High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen delivery is a relatively new therapy that shows the potential to reduce the need for intubation and be better tolerated by children than other non-invasive forms of support.
<INT> HFNC therapy differs from other non-invasive forms of treatment in that it delivers heated, humidified and blended air/oxygen via nasal cannula at rates > 2 L/kg/min.
<INT> This allows the user to deliver high concentrations of oxygen and to potentially deliver continuous distending pressure; this treatment often is better tolerated by the child.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 4); MEDLINE via PubMed (January 1966 to April 2013); EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013); CINAHL (1982 to April 2013); and LILACS (1982 to April 2013).
<MaM> Abstracts from conference proceedings, theses and dissertations and bibliographical references to relevant studies were also searched.
<MaM> We applied no restriction on language.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We planned to included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quas-randomized trials comparing HFNC therapy with other forms of non-invasive respiratory support for children.
<MaM> Treatment failure was defined by the need for additional respiratory support.
<MaM> We excluded children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed all studies for selection and data extraction.
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our search yielded 922 records.
<RES> A total of 109 relevant records were retrieved with reference to our search criteria.
<RES> After duplicates and irrelevant studies were removed, 69 studies were further scrutinized.
<RES> Of these, 11 studies involved children.
<RES> No study matched our inclusion criteria.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Financial incentives within remuneration systems (methods of payment) can influence the behaviour of clinicians working in primary care environments.
<ABS> Systematic reviews in medicine have found that changing the way that doctors are paid can produce substantial changes in the types of activities that are undertaken.
<ABS> For example, paying a fee for specific services can increase the quantity of services delivered, although this may not produce an improvement in patient outcomes.
<ABS> The main methods for remunerating primary care dentists include:
<ABS> Our review identified two studies examining the effects of different methods of remuneration on the behaviour of 821 dentists from 503 dental practices, involving 4771 patients.
<ABS> Both were conducted in the United Kingdom.
<ABS> One study investigated the impact of a fee-for-service payment and an educational intervention on the placement of fissure sealants in permanent molar teeth.
<ABS> The first study found an increase in clinical activity related to fee-for-service payments.
<ABS> In the capitation arm, the dentists tended to see their patients less frequently and tended to carry out fewer fillings and extractions, but tended to give more preventive advice.
<ABS> There was insufficient information regarding cost-effectiveness of the different remuneration methods.
<ABS> Financial incentives within remuneration systems may produce changes to clinical activity undertaken by primary care dentists.
<ABS> However, the number of included studies is limited and the quality of the evidence is low/very low for all outcomes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Methods of remuneration have been linked with the professional behaviour of primary care physicians.
<INT> In dentistry, this can be exacerbated as clinicians operate their practices as businesses and take the full financial risk of the provision of services.
<INT> The main methods for remunerating primary care dentists include fee-for-service, fixed salary and capitation payments.
<INT> The aim of this review was to determine the impact that these remuneration mechanisms have upon primary care dentists’ behaviour.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We conducted cited reference searches for the included studies in ISI Web of Knowledge; searched grey literature sources; handsearched selected journals; and contacted authors of relevant studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Primary care dentists were defined as clinicians that deliver routine or mainstream dental care in a primary care environment.
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled clinical trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies.
<MaM> We also considered measures of practice profitability/income and any reported unintended effects of the included methods of remuneration.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three of the review authors (PRB, JP, AMG) independently reviewed titles and abstracts and resolved disagreements by discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two cluster-RCTs, with data from 503 dental practices, representing 821 dentists and 4771 patients, met the selection criteria.
<RES> We judged the risk of bias to be high for both studies and the overall quality of the evidence was low/very low for all outcomes, as assessed using the GRADE approach.
<RES> One study used a factorial design to investigate the impact of fee-for-service and an educational intervention on the placement of fissure sealants in permanent molar teeth.
<RES> The authors reported a statistically significant increase in clinical activity in the arm that was incentivised with a fee-for-service payment.
<RES> However, the study was conducted in the four most deprived areas of Scotland, so the applicability of the findings to other settings may be limited.
<RES> The study did not report data on measures of health service utilisation or measures of patient outcomes.
<RES> The second study used a parallel group design undertaken over a three-year period to compare the impact of capitation payments with fee-for-service payments on primary care dentists’ clinical activity.
<RES> The study reported on measures of clinical activity (mean percentage of children receiving active preventive advice, health service utilisation (mean number of visits), patient outcomes (mean number of filled teeth, mean percentage of children having one or more teeth extracted and the mean number of decayed teeth) and healthcare costs (mean expenditure).
<RES> Teeth were restored at a later stage in the disease process in the capitation system and the clinicians tended to see their patients less frequently and tended to carry out fewer fillings and extractions, but also tended to give more preventive advice.
<RES> There was insufficient information regarding the cost-effectiveness of the different remuneration methods.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Financial incentives within remuneration systems may produce changes to clinical activity undertaken by primary care dentists.
<CON> However, the number of included studies is limited and the quality of the evidence from the two included studies was low/very low for all outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review, carried out by the Cochrane Oral Health Group, seeks to evaluate the effects of interdental (between the teeth) brushing in addition to toothbrushing as compared with toothbrushing on its own or toothbrushing plus flossing for the prevention and control of periodontal (gum) diseases, dental plaque (a sticky film containing bacteria) and dental caries (tooth decay).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Gum disease and tooth decay are the main reasons for tooth loss.
<ABS> Unless brushed away, plaque can build up on the teeth.
<ABS> A build up of plaque can lead to gum inflammation and gum disease and is also a key factor in the development of tooth decay.
<ABS> Conventional toothbrushing alone is not very effective at removing plaque between teeth.
<ABS> Dental floss has been used for many years together with toothbrushing for removing dental plaque in between teeth.
<ABS> However, recently, interdental brushes to use between the teeth have been developed and many people find them easier to use than floss.
<ABS> If interdental brushes are to be used there must be enough space between the teeth to enable this.
<ABS> Interdental brushes are small-headed toothbrushes available in a range of different widths to match the space between teeth.
<ABS> They can be cone shaped or cylindrical.
<ABS> Brushes for use for cleaning around implants have coated wire to avoid scratching them or causing a shock.
<ABS> Together with dental floss interdental brushes are one of the most commonly recommended, advertised and available aids for cleaning between the teeth.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was current as of 7 March 2013.
<ABS> Seven studies with a total of 354 participants were included in this review.
<ABS> Participants were aged 16 years and over and had teeth.
<ABS> In terms of deciding which studies to include in this review there was no distinction made on the basis of race, gender, jobs (socioeconomic status), place, background exposure to fluoride, initial health status, setting or time of the intervention.
<ABS> Studies were excluded from the review if the majority of participants had any orthodontic appliances (braces), if participants were selected on the basis of special health conditions or if the majority of participants had severe gum disease.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is some very low-quality evidence that using interdental brushes plus toothbrushing is more beneficial than toothbrushing alone for plaque and gingivitis at one month.
<ABS> There is also low-quality evidence that using interdental brushes reduces gingivitis (gum inflammation) by 52% when compared with flossing at one month.
<ABS> There was insufficient evidence to claim a benefit for either interdental brushing or flossing for plaque.
<ABS> None of the studies reported on tooth decay as none were long enough for the changes brought about by early tooth decay between teeth to be detected or found.
<ABS> Three studies reported that no adverse effects or harms were observed or reported during the study.
<ABS> Two other studies provided some data on adverse effects/harms/problems ranging from difficulties manipulating floss, reaching back teeth, interdental brushes distorting and buckling and also (noted to be the most serious) the fact that floss can make gums sore, however we could not formally analyse the data as studies did not provide enough detail.
<ABS> Two studies did not report whether adverse events occurred.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the only study to compare toothbrushing with interdental brushing and toothbrushing alone was assessed as being very low.
<ABS> The quality of evidence for the comparison between interdental brushing and flossing both in addition to toothbrushing was low.
<ABS> No studies reported the development of tooth decay.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Effective oral hygiene is a crucial factor in maintaining good oral health, which is associated with overall health and health-related quality of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 7 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 7 March 2013), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 7 March 2013), CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 7 March 2013), LILACS via BIREME (1982 to 7 March 2013), ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1980 to 7 March 2013) and Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 7 March 2013).
<MaM> We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/) for ongoing trials to 7 March 2013.
<MaM> No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (including split-mouth design, cross-over and cluster-randomised trials) of dentate adult patients.
<MaM> The interventions were a combination of toothbrushing and any interdental brushing procedure compared with toothbrushing only or toothbrushing and flossing.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors assessed each of the included studies to confirm eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using a piloted data extraction form.
<MaM> We calculated standardised mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes where different scales were used to assess an outcome.
<MaM> We attempted to extract data on adverse effects of interventions.
<MaM> Where data were missing or unclear we attempted to contact study authors to obtain further information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There were seven studies (total 354 participants analysed) included in this review.
<RES> We assessed one study as being low, three studies as being high and three studies as being at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> Studies only reported the clinical outcome gingivitis and plaque data, with no studies providing data on many of the outcomes: periodontitis, caries, halitosis and quality of life.
<RES> Three studies reported that no adverse events were observed or reported during the study.
<RES> Two other studies provided some data on adverse events but we were unable to pool the data due to lack of detail.
<RES> Two studies did not report whether adverse events occurred.
<RES> Interdental brushing in addition to toothbrushing, as compared with toothbrushing alone
<RES> Only one high risk of bias study (62 participants in analysis) looked at this comparison and there was very low-quality evidence for a reduction in gingivitis (0 to 4 scale, mean in control): mean difference (MD) 0.53 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.83) and plaque (0 to 5 scale): MD 0.95 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.34) at one month, favouring of use of interdental brushes.
<RES> This represents a 34% reduction in gingivitis and a 32% reduction in plaque.
<RES> Interdental brushing in addition to toothbrushing, as compared with toothbrushing and flossing
<RES> Seven studies provided data showing a reduction in gingivitis in favour of interdental brushing at one month: SMD -0.53 (95% CI -0.81 to -0.24, seven studies, 326 participants, low-quality evidence).
<RES> This translates to a 52% reduction in gingivitis (Eastman Bleeding Index).
<RES> Although a high effect size in the same direction was observed at three months (SMD -1.98, 95% CI -5.42 to 1.47, two studies, 107 participants, very low quality), the confidence interval was wide and did not exclude the possibility of no difference.
<RES> There was insufficient evidence to claim a benefit for either interdental brushing or flossing for reducing plaque (SMD at one month 0.10, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.33, seven studies, 326 participants, low-quality evidence) and insufficient evidence at three months (SMD -2.14, 95% CI -5.25 to 0.97, two studies, 107 participants very low-quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is also low-quality evidence from seven studies that interdental brushing reduces gingivitis when compared with flossing, but these results were only found at one month.
<CON> There was insufficient evidence to determine whether interdental brushing reduced or increased levels of plaque when compared to flossing.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including heart attacks and strokes, are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
<ABS> Drug therapy with blood pressure and cholesterol lowering medications, particularly statins, have been proven to reduce the likelihood that individuals will experience a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event.
<ABS> Aspirin has also been proven to prevent heart attacks, certain types of strokes, and death in people with prior cardiovascular disease.
<ABS> The concept of fixed-dose combination therapy is to combine mulitple medications in a single pill as this has been shown to improve adherence in patients with high blood pressure and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
<ABS> There have been recent randomised controlled clinical trials to evaluate the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy for CVD prevention.
<ABS> The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CVD events, adverse events, blood pressure, lipids, discontinuation rates, quality of life, and costs for CVD prevention.
<ABS> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE until 2013.
<ABS> We found nine randomised controlled trials of two-drug through to five-drug fixed-dose combination therapy with placebo, single drug active component, or usual care in 7047 patients, dating from 2009 to 2013.
<ABS> Trials were generally short-term, ranging from six weeks to 15 months, and included middle-age adults with and without prior CVD.
<ABS> Compared with placebo, single drug active component, or usual care, the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on all-cause mortality or CVD events were uncertain.
<ABS> Of 1000 people treated with fixed-dose combination therapy during the study period, 297 (range 264 to 315) would experience a side effect compared with 242 people treated with placebo.
<ABS> Fixed-dose combination therapy was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (-7.05 mmHg, range -10.18 to -3.87) and total cholesterol (-0.75 mmol/L, range -1.05 to -0.46).
<ABS> However, there was a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in these comparisons so these results should be viewed with caution.
<ABS> Of 1000 patients treated with fixed-dose combination therapy during the study period, 140 (range 122 to 186) would discontinue the therapy compared with 115 patients treated with placebo.
<ABS> The effects on quality of life were uncertain, and no cost data were reported.
<ABS> Ongoing trials of fixed-dose combination therapy will likely inform these important endpoints.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We also aimed to determine discontinuation rates, adverse events, health-related quality of life, and costs of fixed-dose combination therapy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We used no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted the data.
<MaM> We evaluated risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found nine randomised controlled trials with a total of 7047 participants.
<RES> Seven of the nine trials evaluated the effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on primary CVD prevention, and the trial length ranged from six weeks to 15 months.
<RES> We found a moderate to high risk of bias in the domains of selection, performance, detection, attrition, and other types of bias in five of the nine trials. Compared with the comparator groups, the effects of the fixed-dose combination treatment on mortality (1.2% versus 1.0%, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.38,  N = 3465) and cardiovascular events (4.0% versus 2.9%, RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.10, N = 2479) were uncertain (low quality evidence).
<RES> The low event rates for these outcomes, limited availability of data as only two out of nine trials reported on these outcomes, and a high risk of bias in at least one domain suggest that these results should not be viewed with confidence.
<RES> Adverse events were common in both the intervention (30%) and comparator (24%) groups, with participants randomised to fixed-dose combination therapy being 20% (95% CI 9% to 30%) more likely to report an adverse event.
<RES> Notably, no serious adverse events were reported.
<RES> Compared with placebo, the rate of discontinuation among participants randomised to fixed-dose combination was higher (14% versus 11%, RR 1.26 95% CI 1.02 to 1.55).
<RES> The weighted mean differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms were -7.05 mmHg (95% CI -10.18 to -3.87) and -3.65 mmHg (95% CI -5.44 to -1.85), respectively.
<RES> The weighted mean differences (95% CI) in total and LDL cholesterol between the intervention and control arms were -0.75 mmol/L (95% CI -1.05 to -0.46) and -0.81 mmol/L (95% CI -1.09 to -0.53), respectively.
<RES> Fixed-dose combination therapy improved adherence to a multi-drug strategy by 33% (26% to 41%) compared with usual care, but this comparison was reported in only one study.
<RES> The effects of fixed-dose combination therapy on quality of life are uncertain, though these results were reported in only one trial.
<RES> No trials reported costs.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Reductions in blood pressure and lipid parameters are generally lower than those previously projected, though substantial heterogeneity of results exists.
<CON> Fixed-dose combination therapy is associated with modest increases in adverse events compared with placebo, single drug active component, or usual care but may be associated with improved adherence to a multidrug regimen.
<CON> Ongoing trials of fixed-dose combination therapy will likely inform key outcomes.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: dose-response effects on growth

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Asthma guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first choice of treatment for children with persistent asthma that is not well controlled when only a reliever inhaler is used to treat symptoms.
<ABS> Steroids work by reducing inflammation in the lungs and are known to control underlying symptoms of asthma.
<ABS> However, parents and physicians remain concerned about the potential negative effect of ICS on growth.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Does altering the dose of inhaled corticosteroids make a difference in the growth of children with asthma?
<ABS> What evidence did we find?
<ABS> We studied whether a difference could be seen in the growth of children with persistent asthma who were using different doses of the same ICS molecule and the same delivery device.
<ABS> We found 22 eligible trials, but only 10 of them measured growth or other measures of interest.
<ABS> Overall, 3394 children included in the review combined 17 group comparisons (i.e. 17 groups of children with mild to moderate asthma using a particular dose and type of steroid in 10 trials).
<ABS> Trials used different ICS molecules (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone or mometasone) either on their own or in combination with a long-acting beta2-agonist (a drug used to open up the airways) and generally compared low doses of corticosteroids (50 to 100 μg) with low to medium (200 μg) doses of corticosteroids (converted in μg HFA-beclomethasone equivalent) over 12 to 52 weeks.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found a small but statistically significant group difference in growth over 12 months between these different doses clearly favouring the lower dose of ICS.
<ABS> The type of corticosteroid among newer molecules (ciclesonide, fluticasone, mometasone) did not seem to influence the impact on growth over one year.
<ABS> Differences in corticosteroid doses did not seem to affect the change in height, the gain in weight, the gain in bone mass index and the maturation of bones.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review is based on a small number of trials that reported data and were conducted on children with mild to moderate asthma.
<ABS> Only 10 of 22 studies measured the few outcomes of interest for this review, and only four comparisons reported growth over 12 months.
<ABS> Our confidence in the quality of evidence is high for this outcome, however it is low to moderate for several other outcomes, depending on the number of trials reporting these outcomes.
<ABS> Moreover, a few outcomes were reported only by a single trial; as these findings have not been confirmed by other trials, we downgraded the evidence for these outcomes to low quality.
<ABS> An insufficient number of trials have compared the effect of a larger difference in dose, for example, between a high dose and a low dose of ICS and of other popular molecules such as budesonide and beclomethasone over a year or longer of treatment.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We report an evidence-based ICS dose–dependent reduction in growth velocity in prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma.
<ABS> The choice of ICS molecule (mometasone, ciclesonide or fluticasone) was not found to affect the level of growth velocity response over a year.
<ABS> The effect of corticosteroids on growth was not consistently reported: among 22 eligible trials, only four comparisons reported the effects of corticosteroids on growth over one year.
<ABS> In view of parents' and clinicians' concerns, lack of or incomplete reporting of growth is a matter of concern given the importance of the topic.
<ABS> We recommend that growth be systematically reported in all trials involving children taking ICS for three months or longer.
<ABS> Until further data comparing low versus high ICS dose and trials of longer duration are available, we recommend that the minimal effective ICS dose be used in all children with asthma.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first-line treatment for children with persistent asthma.
<INT> Their potential for growth suppression remains a matter of concern for parents and physicians.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors ascertained methodological quality independently using the Cochrane Risk of bias tool.
<MaM> The primary outcome was linear growth velocity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Among 22 eligible trials, 17 group comparisons were derived from 10 trials (3394 children with mild to moderate asthma), measured growth and contributed data to the meta-analysis.
<RES> Trials used ICS (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone or mometasone) as monotherapy or as combination therapy with a long-acting beta2-agonist and generally compared low (50 to 100 μg) versus low to medium (200 μg) doses of hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-beclomethasone equivalent over 12 to 52 weeks.
<RES> The ICS molecules (ciclesonide, fluticasone, mometasone) used in these four comparisons did not significantly influence the magnitude of effect (X2 = 2.19 (2 df), P value 0.33).
<RES> Subgroup analyses on age, baseline severity of airway obstruction, ICS dose and concomitant use of non-steroidal antiasthmatic drugs were not performed because of similarity across trials or inadequate reporting.
<RES> A statistically significant group difference was noted in unadjusted change in height from zero to three months (nine comparisons; N = 944 children; MD 0.15, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.02; moderate-quality evidence) in favour of a higher ICS dose.
<RES> No statistically significant group differences in change in height were observed at other time points, nor were such differences in weight, bone mass index and skeletal maturation reported with low quality of evidence due to imprecision.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In prepubescent school-aged children with mild to moderate persistent asthma, a small but statistically significant group difference in growth velocity was observed between low doses of ICS and low to medium doses of HFA-beclomethasone equivalent, favouring the use of low-dose ICS.
<CON> No apparent difference in the magnitude of effect was associated with three molecules reporting one-year growth velocity, namely, mometasone, ciclesonide and fluticasone.
<CON> In view of prevailing parents’ and physicians’ concerns about the growth suppressive effect of ICS, lack of or incomplete reporting of growth velocity in more than 86% (19/22) of eligible paediatric trials, including those using beclomethasone and budesonide, is a matter of concern.
<CON> All future paediatric trials comparing different doses of ICS with or without placebo should systematically document growth.
<CON> Findings support use of the minimal effective ICS dose in children with asthma.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: We wanted to compare the effectiveness and safety of direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) with vitamin K antagonists in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent stroke.
<ABS> Background: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that arises in a heart with normal valves.
<ABS> It increases the risk of developing blood clots in the heart which can then travel to the brain, leading to a stroke, and to other parts of the body.
<ABS> Warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) is a drug that prevents the formation of such clots, thus reducing the risk of stroke.
<ABS> However, the need for frequent blood tests to adjust the dose and the risk of bleeding limits the use of warfarin.
<ABS> The oral DTIs represent a potential alternative.
<ABS> We aimed to establish the comparative effectiveness and safety of these new drugs compared with the standard treatment (warfarin) used for long-term anticoagulation in people with AF.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included eight studies, identified up to October 2013, evaluating the effect of DTIs versus warfarin in people with non-valvular AF.
<ABS> DTIs included were dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg twice daily (three studies, 12,355 participants), AZD0837 300 mg once a day (two studies, 233 participants) and ximelagatran 36 mg twice daily (three studies, 3726 participants).
<ABS> Of the total number of participants included in this review 61% were men, and the mean age of participants in all studies was over 70 years.
<ABS> Follow-up periods after the end of study medication ranged from zero to four weeks.
<ABS> Key results: We conducted the analyses excluding ximelagatran because this drug was withdrawn from the market owing to toxic effects on the liver.
<ABS> We evaluated the effectiveness of the treatment by the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events.
<ABS> We evaluated safety by the number of (1) fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events, including haemorrhagic strokes, (2) adverse events other than bleeding and ischaemic events that led to treatment discontinuation, and (3) death from all causes.
<ABS> There was no difference in the number of vascular deaths and ischaemic events between all DTIs combined and warfarin, although dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin for this outcome.
<ABS> Major bleeding events were less frequent with the DTIs, making them a potentially safer alternative to anticoagulation in people at high risk.
<ABS> The adverse events that led participants to discontinue treatment were more frequent with the DTIs.
<ABS> Death from all causes was similar between DTIs and warfarin.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: We judged the quality of all eight included studies to be adequate to address the main objectives of the review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) are under investigation as potential alternatives.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (July 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library, May 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to July 2013), EMBASE (1980 to October 2013), LILACS (1982 to October 2013) and trials registers (September 2013).
<MaM> We also searched the websites of clinical trials and pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the reference lists of articles and conference proceedings.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Primary analyses compared all DTIs combined versus warfarin.
<MaM> We performed post hoc analyses excluding ximelagatran because this drug was withdrawn from the market owing to safety concerns.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included eight studies involving a total of 27,557 participants with non-valvular AF and one or more risk factors for stroke; 26,601 of them were assigned to standard doses groups and included in the primary analysis.
<RES> The DTIs: dabigatran 110 mg twice daily and 150 mg twice daily (three studies, 12,355 participants), AZD0837 300 mg once per day (two studies, 233 participants) and ximelagatran 36 mg twice per day (three studies, 3726 participants) were compared with the VKA warfarin (10,287 participants).
<RES> Overall risk of bias and statistical heterogeneity of the studies included were low.
<RES> The odds of vascular death and ischaemic events were not significantly different between all DTIs and warfarin (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.05).
<RES> Sensitivity analysis by dose of dabigatran on reduction in ischaemic events and vascular mortality indicated that dabigatran 150 mg twice daily was superior to warfarin although the effect estimate was of borderline statistical significance (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99).
<RES> Sensitivity analyses by other factors did not alter the results.
<RES> Fatal and non-fatal major bleeding events, including haemorrhagic strokes, were less frequent with the DTIs (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97).
<RES> Adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment were significantly more frequent with the DTIs (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.82 to 2.61).
<RES> All-cause mortality was similar between DTIs and warfarin (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> DTIs were associated with fewer major haemorrhagic events, including haemorrhagic strokes.
<CON> Adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment occurred more frequently with the DTIs.
<CON> We detected no difference in death from all causes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Research has shown that nutrition and radiotherapy have effects on each other.
<ABS> People with malnutrition tend to get more bowel side effects during radiotherapy.
<ABS> It has also been shown that many people lose weight during radiotherapy due to the treatment side effects.
<ABS> These side effects can lead to some people needing gaps in their radiotherapy and sometimes they even need to stop it entirely.
<ABS> This can reduce the chance of cancer cure.
<ABS> This review looked at the literature for providing extra nourishment or changes in diet to patients before or during radiotherapy, to determine whether this is of benefit in terms of reducing bowel symptoms, improving nutritional status and quality of life.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> On reading the summaries of these 45 trials, 10 were suitable to be included in this review.
<ABS> We included trials that looked at the effects of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over having radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic cancer.
<ABS> We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Results showed that studies evaluating dietary changes, including changes in dietary fat, fibre and lactose, during radiotherapy reduced diarrhoea at the end of treatment.
<ABS> However, these dietary changes did not seem to improve patients' weights.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> While some changes to diet during radiotherapy may benefit patients by reducing diarrhoea, it is important to recognise that some of the studies reviewed were dated and there have been changes in radiotherapy technique since then that may give patients less diarrhoea anyway.
<ABS> In addition, many studies were of poor quality and, therefore, only a small number were able to be included in this review.
<ABS> Some interventions described, for example, having to take a liquid diet, were not acceptable as many patients found them difficult to tolerate and were unable to take them completely.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Across the developed world, an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 people are treated annually with pelvic radiotherapy and 80% will develop gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during treatment.
<INT> Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms.
<INT> Up to one-third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four-fifths of patients lose weight during treatment.
<INT> Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012.
<MaM> We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi-randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non-randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients.
<MaM> We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy.
<MaM> We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease.
<MaM> We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We contacted study authors to obtain missing data.
<MaM> We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5.
<MaM> We performed meta-analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method or inverse variance fixed-effect method displayed with heterogeneity.
<MaM> We undertook meta-analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches.
<RES> We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39.
<RES> We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included.
<RES> Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification.
<RES> Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias.
<RES> Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes.
<RES> A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%).
<RES> Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) -0.57 kg; 95% CI -1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%).
<RES> Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies.
<RES> Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated.
<RES> GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studies

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea.
<CON> Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose-restriction, fat-restriction and fibre supplementation.
<CON> We were unable to meta-analyse elemental diet, as data were not available.
<CON> We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias.
<CON> There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution.
<CON> In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chronic graft-versus-host disease is a common complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; transplant of blood-forming stem cells).
<ABS> Immune cells (white blood cells) from the donor recognise the patient's cells as foreign ("non-self").
<ABS> Therefore, the transplanted immune cells attack the cells of the patient.
<ABS> The main affected organs are skin, liver and gut, among other organ tissues.
<ABS> These immune reactions may cause acute inflammation followed by chronic changes of the organs (e.g. fibrosis).
<ABS> First-line therapy usually consists of immunosuppressive drugs in the form of corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents in refractory cases (where the disease is resistant to treatment).
<ABS> The use of these immunosuppressive drugs is designed to suppress the immune-mediated attack of the patient's cells.
<ABS> Limited effectiveness and severe side effects of these immunosuppressive drugs have led to the application of several alternative approaches.
<ABS> Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy that involves collection of immune cells from peripheral blood outside the patient's body.
<ABS> These immune cells are exposed to a photoactive agent (a chemical that responds to exposure to light; e.g. 8-methoxypsoralen) with subsequent ultraviolet-A radiation and then re-infused.
<ABS> The immunomodulatory effects of this procedure have not been completely elucidated.
<ABS> Several current clinical practice recommendations suggest consideration of ECP in paediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) that were designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ECP for the management of chronic graft-versus-host disease in children and adolescents (under 18 years of age) after HSCT.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> We found no RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for paediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease after HSCT.
<ABS> Current recommendations are based on retrospective (a study in which the outcomes have occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational (a study in which the investigators do not seek to intervene, and simply observed the course of events) studies only.
<ABS> Thus, ideally, ECP should be applied in paediatric patients in the context of RCTs only.
<ABS> In the meantime, ECP may be considered in people with steroid-refractory chronic GvHD keeping in mind that such a treatment is not supported by high-level evidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation occurring in 6% to 65% of the recipients.
<INT> Currently, the therapeutic mainstay for chronic GvHD are corticosteroids that are frequently combined with other immunosuppressive agents in people with steroid-refractory manifestations.
<INT> There is no established standard treatment for steroid-refractory chronic GvHD.
<INT> The therapeutic options in these people include extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), an immunomodulatory treatment that involves ex vivo collection of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, exposure to the photoactive agent 8-methoxypsoralen, ultraviolet radiation and re-infusion of the processed cell product.
<INT> The mechanisms of action of ECP are not completely understood.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 9, 2012), MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from their inception to 12 September 2012.
<MaM> We searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies without any language restriction.
<MaM> We searched eight trial registers and five conference proceedings.
<MaM> We also contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed the study selection.
<MaM> We resolved disagreements in the selection of trials by consultation with a third review author.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The efficacy of ECP in the treatment of chronic GvHD in paediatric patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on RCTs can currently not be evaluated since we have found no such studies.
<CON> Current recommendations are based on retrospective or observational studies only.
<CON> Thus, ideally, ECP should be applied in the context of controlled trials only.
<CON> However, performing RCTs in this patient population will be challenging due to the limited number of patients, the variable disease presentation and the lack of well-defined response criteria.
<CON> International collaboration, multicentre trials and appropriate funding for such trials will be needed.
<CON> If treatment decisions based on clinical grounds in favour of ECP are made, people should be carefully monitored for beneficial and harmful effects and efforts should be made to share this information with other clinicians, for example by setting up registries for paediatric patients that are treated with ECP.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We wanted to find out the effects of extra insulation on preventing hypothermia and its complications for adults having an operation.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People can get cold during operations, particularly because of the drugs used as anaesthetics.
<ABS> This can sometimes cause potentially dangerous heart problems.
<ABS> The cold can also make people shiver and feel uncomfortable after an operation.
<ABS> Ways have therefore been developed to try to keep people warm during an operation.
<ABS> One way is to use reflective blankets or clothing as extra insulation.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We looked at the evidence up to February 2014 and found 22 studies involving several hundred patients.
<ABS> The studies involved people aged over 18 years having routine or emergency surgery.
<ABS> We disregarded studies where people were deliberately kept cold during the operation, where they were having head surgery or skin grafts, or where the person was having a procedure under local anaesthetic.
<ABS> We looked at studies comparing what happened when using reflective blankets or clothing against what happened when someone had normal care, using non-reflective blankets or clothing.
<ABS> We also looked at studies comparing what happened when using a machine to force warm air through the person’s blankets (forced air warming) against what happened when using reflective blankets or clothing.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There is no clear evidence that using reflective blankets or clothing increases a person’s temperature compared with what happens when someone has usual care.
<ABS> There is some evidence that using forced air warming increases a person’s temperature compared with what happens when using reflective blankets or clothing.
<ABS> It is unclear how this temperature difference would reduce the consequences of coldness, with uncertain effects on blood loss, shivering and time spent in recovery.
<ABS> We were unable to find sufficient information to look at adverse effects of insulation or warming, or major events affecting the heart or circulatory system.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Most of the evidence was low quality.
<ABS> We were particularly concerned about the potential for skewed results from operating theatre staff changing their behaviour when they knew ways of keeping the patient warm had changed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia occurs because of interference with normal temperature regulation by anaesthetic drugs and exposure of skin for prolonged periods.
<INT> A number of different interventions have been proposed to maintain body temperature by reducing heat loss.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched Current Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We only collected adverse events if reported in the trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 22 trials, with 16 trials providing data for some analyses.
<RES> The trials varied widely in the type of patients and operations, the timing and measurement of temperature, and particularly in the types of co-interventions used.
<RES> The risk of bias was largely unclear, but with a high risk of performance bias in most studies and a low risk of attrition bias.
<RES> The largest comparison of extra insulation versus standard care had five trials with 353 patients at the end of surgery and showed a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 0.12 ºC (95% CI -0.07 to 0.31; low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no clear effects on bleeding, shivering or length of stay in post-anaesthetic care for either comparison.
<RES> No other adverse effects were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is no clear benefit of extra thermal insulation compared with standard care.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with irregularity in heart activity, mechanical heart valves, and clotting disorders are at increased risk of developing blood clots, which could lead to stroke or death.
<ABS> Taking warfarin significantly reduces this risk.
<ABS> However, taking too much warfarin can lead to excessive bleeding, while taking too little reduces its benefit.
<ABS> To monitor this, patients taking warfarin must have regular blood tests to check if their dose of warfarin is stable enough to find the correct balance.
<ABS> There is some evidence that adding a small dose of vitamin K to the warfarin improves this balance.
<ABS> In this review, our primary outcomes were to assess if the addition of low-dose vitamin K to warfarin had an effect on the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range; the mean within the therapeutic range; or any adverse events, such as thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or mortality.
<ABS> We found two studies that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range.
<ABS> One study was only available in an abbreviated format, so we were unable to interpret the results fully.
<ABS> Nonetheless, it was suggested that the addition of vitamin K had no benefit.
<ABS> A second six-month study gave a small dose of vitamin K (150 mcg daily) or placebo to participants taking warfarin with existing poor INR control.
<ABS> This study reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage and found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 mcg oral vitamin K significantly improved their anticoagulation control.
<ABS> However, the study was relatively small.
<ABS> Neither study reported any adverse events, such as thromboembolism, haemorrhage, or death.
<ABS> We conclude that further larger, higher quality studies are needed to conclude whether adding vitamin K to warfarin for patients starting or already on warfarin improves their anticoagulation control.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Effective use of warfarin involves keeping the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range.
<INT> However, patients respond widely to their dose of warfarin.
<INT> Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation can lead to increased clot formation.
<INT> There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011).
<MaM> We did not apply any language or date restrictions.
<MaM> We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from included studies.
<MaM> When disagreement arose, a third author helped reached a consensus.
<MaM> We also assessed risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two studies with a total of 100 participants for inclusion in the review.
<RES> We found the overall risk of bias to be unclear in a number of domains.
<RES> Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range.
<RES> Only one study (70 participants) reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage.
<RES> This study found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 micrograms (mcg) oral vitamin K significantly improved anticoagulation control in those with unexplained instability of response to warfarin.
<RES> The second study (30 participants) reported the effect of 175 mcg oral vitamin K versus placebo on participants with high variability in their INR levels.
<RES> The study concluded that vitamin K supplementation did not significantly improve the stability of anticoagulation for participants on chronic anticoagulation therapy.
<RES> However, the study was only available in abstract form, and communication with the lead author confirmed that there were no further publications.
<RES> Therefore, we interpreted this conclusion with caution.
<RES> Neither study reported any thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or death from the addition of vitamin K supplementation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Two included studies in this review compared whether the addition of a low dose (150 to 175 mcg) of vitamin K given to participants with a high-variability response to warfarin improved their INR control.
<CON> One study demonstrated a significant improvement, while another smaller study (published in abstract only) suggested no overall benefit.
<CON> Currently, there are insufficient data to suggest an overall benefit.
<CON> Larger, higher quality trials are needed to examine if low-dose vitamin K improves INR control in those starting or already taking warfarin.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review questions
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence to see whether allowing for low blood oxygen levels, as opposed to normal blood oxygen levels, in severely ill people on mechanical breathing machines (ventilators) in intensive care units (ICUs) (otherwise known as critical care units (CCUs)) changed their chances of recovery (morbidity) and survival rate (mortality).
<ABS> We found no studies eligible for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A common feature of people who become severely unwell and require admission to the ICU/CCU is lack of oxygen in the blood.
<ABS> Regardless of the initial reason that caused them to become unwell, people on the ICU/CCU suffer from the effects of low oxygen levels; however the treatments that we can currently offer are frequently ineffective and may even be harmful.
<ABS> High levels of oxygen are toxic, and the ventilators used to deliver oxygen may cause physical damage to the lungs.
<ABS> Conversely, lower levels of oxygen in the blood than are considered normal are not necessarily harmful and may be seen in people who subsequently fully recover, or in healthy people at altitude.
<ABS> We therefore wanted to ascertain whether any research had been done to examine whether allowing low blood oxygen levels, as opposed to normal blood oxygen levels, in ventilated severely ill people on the ICU/CCU altered their morbidity and mortality.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We were looking for studies that assessed the morbidity and mortality of ventilated people who were at least one year old.
<ABS> We were looking for studies in which the intention in one group of people was to maintain low levels of blood oxygen, and the intention in the other group of people was to maintain normal levels of blood oxygen.
<ABS> We included studies involving people irrespective of gender, ethnicity and past medical history.
<ABS> The evidence is current to November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Our search yielded 2419 results.
<ABS> After exclusion of duplications, 1651 candidate studies were identified.
<ABS> Upon assessing the titles and abstracts of candidate studies, we found that none met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> We are therefore unable to identify or comment as to whether allowing for low blood oxygen levels is beneficial.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> As no studies were included in our review, we cannot comment on the quality of evidence.
<ABS> Given the lack of evidence related to safety issues regarding allowing for low, as opposed to normal, levels of blood oxygen, we recommend caution with respect to changing current medical practice in this area.
<ABS> We do believe however that future research into this question is necessary.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Permissive hypoxaemia describes a concept in which a lower level of arterial oxygenation (PaO2) than usual is accepted to avoid the detrimental effects of high fractional inspired oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation.
<INT> Currently however, no specific threshold is known that defines permissive hypoxaemia, and its use in adults remains formally untested.
<INT> The importance of this systematic review is thus to determine whether any substantial evidence is available to support the notion that permissive hypoxaemia may improve clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We assessed whether permissive hypoxaemia (accepting a lower PaO2 than is current practice) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients affects patient morbidity and mortality.
<OBJ> We planned to conduct subgroup and sensitivity analyses and to examine the role of bias to determine the level of evidence provided.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 11, part of The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (1954 to November 2013); EMBASE (1980 to November 2013); CINAHL (1982 to November 2013) and ISI Web of Science (1946 to November 2013).
<MaM> We combined the sensitive search strategies described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MEDLINE and EMBASE.
<MaM> For ongoing trials, we also searched the following databases: MetaRegister of ControlledTrials and the National Research Register.
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared outcomes for mechanically ventilated critically ill participants, in which the intervention group was targeted to be hypoxaemic relative to the control group, and the control group was normoxaemic or was mildly hypoxaemic, were eligible for inclusion in this review.
<MaM> Exact values defining 'conventional' and 'permissive hypoxaemia' groupings were purposely not specified, and the manner in which these oxygenation goals were achieved also was not specified.
<MaM> We did state however that the intervention group required a target oxygenation level lower than that of the control group, and that the control group target levels should be in the range of normoxaemia or mild hypoxaemia (not hyperoxaemia).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Using the results of the above searches, two review authors (EG-K and KM) independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility and duplication.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our search strategy yielded a total of 2419 results.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This comprehensive review failed to identify any relevant studies evaluating permissive hypoxaemia versus normoxaemia in mechanically ventilated critically ill participants.
<CON> Therefore we are unable to support or refute the hypothesis that this treatment strategy is of benefit to patients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The liver produces bile, which has many functions including elimination of waste processed by the liver and digestion of fat.
<ABS> The bile is temporarily stored in the gallbladder (an organ situated underneath the liver in the abdomen (belly) before it reaches the small bowel.
<ABS> Concretions in the gallbladder are called gallstones.
<ABS> Gallstones are present in about 5% to 25% of the adult western population.
<ABS> Between 2% and 4% become symptomatic in one year.
<ABS> The symptoms include pain related to the gallbladder (biliary colic), inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder into the small bowel resulting in jaundice (yellowish discolouration of the body usually most prominently noticed in the white of the eye, which turns yellow), bile infection (cholangitis), and inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that secretes digestive juices and harbours the insulin-secreting cells that maintain blood sugar level (pancreatitis).
<ABS> Removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is currently considered the best treatment option for patients with symptomatic gallstones.
<ABS> This is generally performed by key-hole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).
<ABS> Generally, before being operated on, patients will be given informal information by the healthcare providers involved in the care of the patients (doctors, nurses, ward clerks, or healthcare assistants).
<ABS> This information is likely to include some information on the type of anaesthesia, expected duration of surgery, expected outcome of surgery including the complications, duration of hospital stay, wound dressing care (if applicable), return to normal activity, and return to work.
<ABS> This information can also be provided formally in different formats including written information, formal lectures, video, or computer presentations.
<ABS> The review authors set out to determine whether it is preferable to provide formal information to the patients before the operation.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the medical literature in order to identify studies that provided information on the above question.
<ABS> The authors obtained information from randomised trials only since such types of trials provide the best information if conducted well.
<ABS> Two review authors independently identified the trials and collected the information.
<ABS> The information is current to March 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found four trials including 431 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who received either formal patient education (215 participants) or standard care (216 participants).
<ABS> The choice of whether the patient received formal patient education or standard care was determined by a method similar to the toss of a coin in order to create comparable groups of patients.
<ABS> The patient education included providing information by just talking to the patient but in a more formal way or by using various method of presentation.
<ABS> All the trials were of high risk of bias (faults in study design that can result in erroneous conclusions).
<ABS> Only one trial including 212 participants reported deaths after surgery.
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in this trial.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of an effect on pain scores at 9 to 24 hours, patient knowledge, patient satisfaction, or patient anxiety associated with education.
<ABS> None of the trials reported surgical complications, quality of life, percentage of patients discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, return to work, or the number of unplanned visits to the doctor.
<ABS> A total of 173 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent patient education with repeat-back (patients repeating back the information provided) (92 participants) or patient education without repeat-back (81 participants) in one trial of high risk of bias.
<ABS> The only outcome reported in this trial was patient knowledge.
<ABS> The results we found for the effect onpatient knowledge between the patient education with repeat-back and patient education without repeat-back groups were uncertain and we could not exclude possible benefits of either education or control.
<ABS> Due to the very low quality of the current evidence, we are uncertain as to whether formal patient education provided in addition to the standard information provided by doctors has any benefit to patients.
<ABS> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the evidence was very low.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To compare the benefits and harms of formal preoperative patient education for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 2, 2013), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to March 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted the data.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 431 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to formal patient education (215 participants) versus standard care (216 participants) in four trials.
<RES> The patient education included verbal education, multimedia DVD programme, computer-based multimedia programme, and PowerPoint presentation in the four trials.
<RES> All the trials were of high risk of bias.
<RES> One trial including 212 patients reported mortality.
<RES> There was no mortality in either group in this trial.
<RES> None of the trials reported surgery-related morbidity, quality of life, proportion of patients discharged as day-procedure laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the length of hospital stay, return to work, or the number of unplanned visits to the doctor.
<RES> There were insufficient details to calculate the mean difference and 95% CI for the difference in pain scores at 9 to 24 hours (1 trial; 93 patients); and we did not identify clear evidence of an effect on patient knowledge (3 trials; 338 participants; SMD 0.19; 95% CI -0.02 to 0.41; very low quality evidence), patient satisfaction (2 trials; 305 patients; SMD 0.48; 95% CI -0.42 to 1.37; very low quality evidence), or patient anxiety (1 trial; 76 participants; SMD -0.37; 95% CI -0.82 to 0.09; very low quality evidence) between the two groups.
<RES> A total of 173 participants undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to electronic consent with repeat-back (patients repeating back the information provided) (92 participants) versus electronic consent without repeat-back (81 participants) in one trial of high risk of bias.
<RES> The only outcome reported in this trial was patient knowledge.
<RES> The effect on patient knowledge between the patient education with repeat-back versus patient education without repeat-back groups was imprecise and based on 1 trial of 173 participants; SMD 0.07; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.37; very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Due to the very low quality of the current evidence, the effects of formal patient education provided in addition to the standard information provided by doctors to patients compared with standard care remain uncertain.
<CON> Further well-designed randomised clinical trials of low risk of bias are necessary.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Total knee replacement is a common and often painful orthopaedic operation.
<ABS> Femoral nerve block (FNB) is an analgesic technique that blocks sensation to the knee to reduce pain following surgery.
<ABS> FNB is given as a single injection or as continuous infusion of numbing medication in the groin area.
<ABS> This review compared FNB with other common analgesic techniques (patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with opioids, epidural analgesia, local infiltration analgesia and oral analgesia).
<ABS> A total of 45 randomised trials with 2710 participants were included.
<ABS> Among the included studies, 30 treatment groups compared FNB with PCA opioids, 10 compared FNB with epidural analgesia, five compared FNB with local infiltration analgesia, one compared FNB with oral analgesia and four compared continuous FNB with single-injection FNB.
<ABS> The average methodological quality of the included studies was moderate.
<ABS> FNB (any type) resulted in less pain at rest and on movement during the first 72 hours after surgery, compared with PCA opioid alone.
<ABS> FNB also resulted in lower opioid consumption, fewer patients with nausea and vomiting, greater knee flexion and higher patient satisfaction, compared with PCA opioid.
<ABS> Additionally, continuous FNB provided better pain relief than was attained with single-injection FNB.
<ABS> No differences in postoperative pain and opioid consumption at 24 hours were noted between FNB and epidural analgesia, although the former resulted in fewer patients with nausea and vomiting, and higher patient satisfaction was reported with analgesia.
<ABS> Similarly, we found no difference in postoperative pain between participants given FNB as opposed to local infiltration analgesia.
<ABS> Information was insufficient for review authors to conclude on the comparison of FNB with local infiltration analgesia or oral analgesia, or on the safety of the various analgesic techniques.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common and often painful operation.
<INT> Femoral nerve block (FNB) is frequently used for postoperative analgesia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2013, Issue 1, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, dissertation abstracts and reference lists of included studies.
<MaM> The date of the last search was 31 January 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We also included RCTs that compared continuous versus single-shot FNB.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed study selection and data extraction.
<MaM> We undertook meta-analysis (random-effects model) and used relative risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes.
<MaM> We interpreted SMDs according to rule of thumb where 0.2 or smaller represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect and 0.8 or larger, a large effect.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 45 eligible RCTs (2710 participants) from 47 publications; 20 RCTs had more than two allocation groups.
<RES> A total of 29 RCTs compared FNB (with or without concurrent treatments including PCA opioid) versus PCA opioid, 10 RCTs compared FNB versus epidural, five RCTs compared FNB versus local infiltration analgesia, one RCT compared FNB versus oral analgesia and four RCTs compared continuous versus single-shot FNB.
<RES> Most included RCTs were rated as low or unclear risk of bias for the aspects rated in the risk of bias assessment tool, except for the aspect of blinding.
<RES> We rated 14 (31%) RCTs at high risk for both participant and assessor blinding and rated eight (18%) RCTs at high risk for one blinding aspect.
<RES> Pain at rest and pain on movement were less for FNB (of any type) with or without a concurrent PCA opioid compared with PCA opioid alone during the first 72 hours post operation.
<RES> Pooled results demonstrated a moderate effect of FNB for pain at rest at 24 hours (19 RCTs, 1066 participants, SMD -0.72, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.51, moderate-quality evidence) and a moderate to large effect for pain on movement at 24 hours (17 RCTs, 1017 participants, SMD -0.94, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.55, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Pain was also less in each FNB subgroup: single-shot FNB, continuous FNB and continuous FNB + sciatic block, compared with PCA.
<RES> FNB also was associated with lower opioid consumption (IV morphine equivalent) at 24 hours (20 RCTs, 1156 participants, MD -14.74 mg, 95% CI -18.68 to -10.81 mg, high-quality evidence) and at 48 hours (MD -14.53 mg, 95% CI -20.03 to -9.02 mg), lower risk of nausea and/or vomiting (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.68, number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) four, high-quality evidence), greater knee flexion (11 RCTs, 596 participants, MD 6.48 degrees, 95% CI 4.27 to 8.69 degrees, moderate-quality evidence) and greater patient satisfaction (four RCTs, 180 participants, SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.38, low-quality evidence) compared with PCA.
<RES> We could not demonstrate a difference in pain between FNB (any type) and epidural analgesia in the first 72 hours post operation, including pain at 24 hours at rest (six RCTs, 328 participants, SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.32, moderate-quality evidence) and on movement (six RCTs, 317 participants, SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.24, high-quality evidence).
<RES> No difference was noted at 24 hours for opioid consumption (five RCTs, 341 participants, MD -4.35 mg, 95% CI -9.95 to 1.26 mg, high-quality evidence) or knee flexion (six RCTs, 328 participants, MD -1.65, 95% CI -5.14 to 1.84, high-quality evidence).
<RES> However, FNB demonstrated lower risk of nausea/vomiting (four RCTs, 183 participants, RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.97, NNTH 8, moderate-quality evidence) and higher patient satisfaction (two RCTs, 120 participants, SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97, low-quality evidence), compared with epidural analgesia.
<RES> Pooled results of four studies (216 participants) comparing FNB with local infiltration analgesia detected no difference in analgesic effects between the groups at 24 hours for pain at rest (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.72, moderate-quality evidence) or pain on movement (SMD 0.38, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.86, low-quality evidence).
<RES> Only one included RCT compared FNB with oral analgesia.
<RES> We considered this evidence insufficient to allow judgement of the effects of FNB compared with oral analgesia.
<RES> Continuous FNB provided less pain compared with single-shot FNB (four RCTs, 272 participants) at 24 hours at rest (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.07, moderate-quality evidence) and on movement (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.17, high-quality evidence).
<RES> Continuous FNB also demonstrated lower opioid consumption compared with single-shot FNB at 24 hours (three RCTs, 236 participants, MD -13.81 mg, 95% CI -23.27 to -4.35 mg, moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Generally, the meta-analyses demonstrated considerable statistical heterogeneity, with type of FNB, allocation concealment and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors reducing heterogeneity in the analyses.
<RES> Available evidence was insufficient to allow determination of the comparative safety of the various analgesic techniques.
<RES> Few RCTs reported on serious adverse effects such as neurological injury, postoperative falls or thrombotic events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The review also found that continuous FNB provided better analgesia compared with single-shot FNB.
<CON> RCTs were insufficient to allow definitive conclusions on the comparison between FNB and local infiltration analgesia or oral analgesia.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Scabies is a common parasitic infection.
<ABS> It is caused by a mite, Sarcoptes scabiei variety hominis, also known as the human itch mite, which depends on humans to survive.
<ABS> Crusted scabies (or Norwegian scabies) is caused by the same mite, but tends to occur in people whose immune system is not working so well, such as transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy, people who misuse alcohol, or other debilitated people.
<ABS> Scabies infection spreads from person to person by skin contact.
<ABS> This is why it is more prevalent in areas with poor sanitation or overcrowding.
<ABS> In high-income countries it tends to spread between family contacts, between people in residential care, or between patients and staff in hospitals.
<ABS> People may be infected with these mites for several weeks before developing symptoms.
<ABS> During this time it is possible to spread the infection to other people.
<ABS> Consequently people who are in contact with suspected cases of scabies infection are often given preventative treatments in an attempt to stop the development of symptoms.
<ABS> Preventive treatment also aims to prevent further spread of the infection and to prevent the person who was the source of infection from getting reinfected.
<ABS> This review is important, as before conducting this review we were unable to say if using preventive treatment helps or not.
<ABS> What does the research say?
<ABS> We searched for studies in which people who had been in contact with scabies-infected people had been given medical treatment, or had been advised about personal hygiene to prevent the scabies infection from spreading.
<ABS> We also wanted studies to have been designed so that the treatment received by participants (either medication or advice) was determined by chance.
<ABS> We did not find any studies fulfilling these criteria.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> There is currently no evidence to say if treating or advising people who have been in contact with scabies-infected people is effective in preventing the spread of scabies infection.
<ABS> We need researchers to conduct studies with people who may have been in skin contact with a person who has been diagnosed with a scabies infection within the previous six weeks.
<ABS> Half of these people should be given preventive treatment and the other half something else.
<ABS> Who gets what should be determined by chance so that the two groups are truly similar in every respect except the treatment they receive.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Scabies, caused by Sarcoptes scabiei variety hominis or the human itch mite, is a common parasitic infection.
<INT> The most common symptom reported is itch which is worse at night.
<INT> As the symptoms are attributed to an allergic reaction to the mite, symptoms usually develop between four to six weeks after primary infection.
<INT> Therefore, people may be infected for some time prior to developing symptoms.
<INT> During this time, while asymptomatic, they may spread infection to others they are in close contact with.
<INT> Consequently, it is usually recommended that when an index case is being treated, others who have been in close contact with the index case should also be provided with treatment.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Interventions could be compared to each other, or to placebo or to no treatment.
<MaM> Both drug treatments and non-drug treatments were acceptable.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We intended to report any adverse outcomes similarly.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We did not include any trials in this review.
<RES> Out of 29 potentially-relevant studies, we excluded 16 RCTs as the data for the contacts were either not reported or were reported only in combination with the outcomes for the index cases.
<RES> We excluded a further 11 studies as they were not RCTs.
<RES> We also excluded one study as not all subjects were examined at baseline and follow-up, and another as it was a case study.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The effects of providing prophylactic treatments for contacts of people with scabies to prevent infestation are unknown.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pain in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a disease that affects the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, is often under recognised and poorly managed.
<ABS> Our aim in this review was to find out whether medicines for pain in GBS are safe and effective.
<ABS> We first carried out a wide search of medical databases to find studies that met the requirements for this review.
<ABS> We identified three studies, which involved 277 participants who were randomly assigned to different treatments for pain in GBS.
<ABS> Two medicines, gabapentin and carbamazepine, reduced pain severity compared to placebo (inactive) treatment and they had few side effects.
<ABS> One study found that people taking gabapentin had less pain, sleepiness or need for additional pain killers than those given carbamazepine.
<ABS> However, these studies were small and the treatment period was short.
<ABS> One trial, with 223 participants, found that methylprednisolone, which is a steroid medicine, did not affect the numbers of people who developed pain or change the numbers with more pain or less pain compared with placebo.
<ABS> This study did not report whether there were any side effects.
<ABS> This review does not provide enough evidence to say whether or not treatments for pain in people with GBS work.
<ABS> Although both gabapentin and carbamazepine reduced the severity of pain compared to placebo, and few side effects were reported, the studies were small and the quality of the evidence was very low.
<ABS> Much larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm that drug treatments are safe and effective for people with pain in the period soon after onset of GBS.
<ABS> Long-term studies of pain treatments at the stage when people with GBS are recovering should also be conducted and these should include assessment of effects of pain treatments on quality of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 27 August 2012, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (2012, Issue 8) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2012).
<MaM> In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in participants with confirmed GBS, with pain assessment as either the primary or secondary outcome.
<MaM> For cross-over trials, an adequate washout period between phases was required for inclusion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three short-term RCTs, which enrolled 277 randomised participants with acute phase GBS, were included.
<RES> Risk of bias in the included studies was generally unclear due to insufficient information.
<RES> None of the included studies reported the primary outcome selected for this review, which was number of patients with self reported pain relief of 50% or greater.
<RES> One small study investigated seven-day regimens of gabapentin versus placebo.
<RES> Pain was rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain).
<RES> Amongst the 18 participants, significantly lower mean pain scores were found at the endpoint (day 7) in the gabapentin phase compared to the endpoint of the placebo phase (mean difference -3.61, 95% CI -4.12 to -3.10) (very low quality evidence).
<RES> For adverse events, no significant differences were found in the incidence of nausea (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.04) or constipation (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.54).
<RES> A second study enrolling 36 participants compared gabapentin, carbamazepine and placebo, all administered over seven days.
<RES> Participants in the gabapentin group had significantly lower median pain scores on all treatment days in comparison to the placebo and carbamazepine groups (P < 0.05).
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences in the median pain scores between the carbamazepine and placebo groups from day 1 to day 3, but from day 4 until the end of the study significantly lower median pain scores were noted in the carbamazepine group (P < 0.05) (very low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no adverse effects of gabapentin or carbamazepine reported other than sedation.
<RES> One large RCT (223 participants, all also treated with intravenous immunoglobulin), compared a five-day course of methylprednisolone with placebo and found no statistically significant differences in number of participants developing pain (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.16), number of participants with decreased pain (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.42) or number of participants with increased pain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.41) (low quality evidence).
<RES> The study did not report whether there were any adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Although reductions in pain severity were found when comparing gabapentin and carbamazepine with placebo, the evidence was limited and its quality very low.
<CON> Larger, well-designed RCTs are required to further investigate the efficacy and safety of potential interventions for patients with pain in GBS.
<CON> Additionally, interventions for pain in the convalescent phase of GBS should be investigated.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Probiotics for preventing gestational diabetes

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Gestational diabetes mellitus is a condition where the mother has high blood sugar levels during pregnancy.
<ABS> It is associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the mother, such as pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure with protein in the urine) and instrumental or operative delivery, as well as for the infants who may be born large-for-gestational age.
<ABS> Current treatment includes diet with or without medication.
<ABS> Prevention of this condition would be preferable to treatment.
<ABS> Preventative diet and lifestyle interventions are time consuming and do not always reduce the number of women getting gestational diabetes.
<ABS> Probiotics - 'good' bacteria that are usually taken in the form of capsules or drinks - supplement the gut bacteria.
<ABS> They have the potential to change a person's metabolism and so prevent gestational diabetes mellitus.
<ABS> This review was designed to look at whether there is evidence to show if this is true or not.
<ABS> At the moment there is only one randomised controlled study, which involved 256 women.
<ABS> This study does show a lower rate of gestational diabetes mellitus in women who took probiotics from early pregnancy, with the rate of diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus being reduced by two-thirds and their babies on average weighed 127 g less at birth.
<ABS> This study did not find differences in the rates of miscarriage, intrauterine or neonatal death or stillbirth.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence of a change in the proportion of women delivered by caesarean section or in the risk of preterm delivery.
<ABS> The study did not report on how much weight the mothers gained during pregnancy or how many babies were large-for-gestational age or that weighed more than 4000 g at birth or on the body composition of the babies.
<ABS> One study is not enough to draw any definite conclusions at the moment.
<ABS> There are other studies underway.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and infant.
<INT> The prevention of GDM using lifestyle interventions has proven difficult.
<INT> The gut microbiome (the composite of bacteria present in the intestines) influences host inflammatory pathways, glucose and lipid metabolism and, in other settings, alteration of the gut microbiome has been shown to impact on these host responses.
<INT> Probiotics are one way of altering the gut microbiome but little is known about their use in influencing the metabolic environment of pregnancy.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised and cluster-randomised trials comparing the use of probiotic supplementation with other methods for the prevention of the development of GDM.
<MaM> Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.
<MaM> Quasi-randomised and cross-over design studies are not eligible for inclusion in this review.
<MaM> Studies presented only as abstracts with no subsequent full report of study results would also have been excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven reports (relating to five possible trials) were found.
<RES> We included one study (six trial reports) involving 256 women.
<RES> Four other studies are ongoing.
<RES> The included trial consisted of three treatment arms: probiotic with dietary intervention, placebo and dietary intervention, and dietary intervention alone; it was at a low risk of bias.
<RES> The study reported primary outcomes of a reduction in the rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.70), with no statistical difference in the rates of miscarriage/intrauterine fetal death (IUFD)/stillbirth/neonatal death (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 11.35).
<RES> Secondary outcomes reported were a reduction in infant birthweight (mean difference (MD) -127.71 g, 95% CI -251.37 to -4.06) in the probiotic group and no clear evidence of increased risk of preterm delivery (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.44 to 24.43), or caesarean section rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.32).
<RES> The primary infant outcomes of rates of macrosomia and large-for-gestational age infants were not reported.
<RES> The following secondary outcomes were not reported: maternal gestational weight gain, pre-eclampsia, and the long-term diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; infant body composition, shoulder dystocia, admission to neonatal intensive care, jaundice, hypoglycaemia and long-term rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> One trial has shown a reduction in the rate of GDM when women are randomised to probiotics early in pregnancy but more uncertain evidence of any effect on miscarriage/IUFD/stillbirth/neonatal death.
<CON> There are no data on macrosomia.
<CON> At this time, there are insufficient studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis.
<CON> Further results are awaited from four ongoing studies.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Pressure ulcers, also called pressure injury, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores are caused by pressure, rubbing or friction at the weight-bearing bony points of the body (such as hips, heels and elbows).
<ABS> A pressure ulcer is characterised by an area of localised injury to the skin or underlying tissue over a bony prominence that results from pressure or shearing, or a combination of both.
<ABS> Pressure ulcers most commonly occur in the elderly, or those who are immobile, either when in bed or sitting.
<ABS> Repositioning (i.e. turning) is one strategy used alongside other preventative strategies to relieve pressure, and so prevent development of pressure ulcers.
<ABS> Repositioning involves moving the person into a different position to remove or redistribute pressure from a particular part of the body.
<ABS> We identified three studies which recruited 502 people.
<ABS> Evidence to support the use of repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers is low in volume and quality and we still do not know if particular positions or frequencies of repositioning reduce pressure ulcer development.
<ABS> None of the trials reported on pain or quality of life.
<ABS> There is a need for further research to measure the effects of repositioning on pressure ulcer development and to find the best repositioning regimen in terms of frequency and position.
<ABS> It is important to emphasise that this lack of evidence showing that repositioning is effective or which repositioning regimen is the best does not mean that repositioning is ineffective.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A pressure ulcer (PU), also referred to as a 'pressure injury', 'pressure sore', or 'bedsore' is defined as an area of localised tissue damage that is caused by unrelieved pressure, friction or shearing forces on any part of the body.
<INT> PUs commonly occur in patients who are elderly and less mobile, and carry significant human and economic impacts.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three RCTs and one economic study representing a total of 502 randomised participants from acute and long-term care settings.
<RES> Two trials compared the 30º and 90º tilt positions using similar repositioning frequencies (there was a small difference in frequency of overnight repositioning in the 90º tilt groups between the trials).
<RES> The third RCT compared alternative repositioning frequencies.
<RES> All three studies reported the proportion of patients developing PU of any grade, stage or category.
<RES> None of the trials reported on pain, or quality of life, and only one reported on cost.
<RES> All three trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> The two trials of 30º tilt vs. 90º were pooled using a random effects model (I² = 69%) (252 participants).
<RES> The risk ratio for developing a PU in the 30º tilt and the standard 90º position was very imprecise (pooled RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.97, P=0.62, very low quality evidence).
<RES> This comparison is underpowered and at risk of a Type 2 error (only 21 events).
<RES> In the third study, a cluster randomised trial, participants were randomised between 2-hourly and 3-hourly repositioning on standard hospital mattresses and 4 hourly and 6 hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam mattresses.
<RES> This study was also underpowered and at high risk of bias.
<RES> The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) with 2-hourly repositioning compared with 3-hourly repositioning on a standard mattress was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.16, very low quality evidence).
<RES> The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) was compatible with a large reduction and no difference between 4-hourly repositioning and 6-hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02, very low quality evidence).
<RES> A cost-effectiveness analysis based on data derived from one of the included parallel RCTs compared 3-hourly repositioning using the 30º tilt overnight with standard care consisting of 6-hourly repositioning using the 90º lateral rotation overnight.
<RES> In this evaluation the only included cost was nursing time.
<RES> The intervention was reported to be cost saving compared with standard care (nurse time cost per patient €206.6 vs €253.1, incremental difference €-46.5; 95%CI: €-1.25 to €-74.60).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Repositioning is an integral component of pressure ulcer prevention and treatment; it has a sound theoretical rationale, and is widely recommended and used in practice.
<CON> The lack of robust evaluations of repositioning frequency and position for pressure ulcer prevention mean that great uncertainty remains but it does not mean these interventions are ineffective since all comparisons are grossly underpowered.
<CON> Current evidence is small in volume and at risk of bias and there is currently no strong evidence of a reduction in pressure ulcers with the 30° tilt compared with the standard 90º position or good evidence of an effect of repositioning frequency.
<CON> There is a clear need for high-quality, adequately-powered trials to assess the effects of position and optimal frequency of repositioning on pressure ulcer incidence.
<CON> The limited data derived from one economic evaluation means it remains unclear whether repositioning every 3 hours using the 30º tilt is less costly in terms of nursing time and more effective than standard care involving repositioning every 6 hours using a 90º tilt.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Recently there has been an increase in the use of ICT (Information Communication Technology) for the delivery of information to people with severe mental illness.
<ABS> ICT is considered to be any technical means of delivering information and communication and can include use of telephones, television, radio, computers and hand-held devices.
<ABS> People with severe mental health problems often have difficulties with 'treatment compliance' i.e. following their treatment programme.
<ABS> They can have difficulty remembering to take medication or appointment times.
<ABS> Unpleasant side effects of medication can also lead to people stopping medication, and a lack of insight into their illness can mean they do not see the need to follow treatments.
<ABS> Non-compliance with treatment can lead to poor health outcomes and even relapses and hospitalisation.
<ABS> There are several methods healthcare professionals use to help people with serious mental illness improve compliance; once such method is prompting.
<ABS> The purpose of prompting is to help patients to follow the treatment instructions and keep the treatment appointment times by using reminders via telephone calls, personal visits or posted referral letter.
<ABS> More recently, Information and technology-based prompts are being used.
<ABS> This review investigates the effectiveness of ICT-based prompts in order to support treatment compliance among patients with serious mental illness.
<ABS> A search for randomised controlled trials was run in 2012.
<ABS> Two trials that compared the use of ICT prompting compared with standard care could be included.
<ABS> Review authors rated the quality of data in these as 'moderate' or 'low'.
<ABS> Because of the small amount of data, it is impossible to say whether ICT-based prompts are effective.
<ABS> Only one trial measured medication compliance.
<ABS> The study suggested that ICT-based prompts may help people take their medication, but clear evidence of a benefit is missing.
<ABS> There were some positive effects for patient insight.
<ABS> However, insight was only better in the medium term and appeared to show no difference in the short term.
<ABS> Further, some positive effect was found in patient satisfaction with treatment, although the results for the analyses were imprecise.
<ABS> Also, mental state and quality of life showed minor improvement.
<ABS> There were no clear evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other.
<ABS> Outcomes such as service use, behaviour, costs or adverse effects were not presented in the studies.
<ABS> There is an ongoing trial, but additional well-conducted trials are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Non-compliance is a significant problem among people with serious mental disorders, presenting a challenge for mental health professionals.
<INT> Prompts such as telephone calls, visits, and a posted referral letter to patients are currently used to encourage patient attendance at clinics and/or compliance with medication.
<INT> More recently, the use of information and communication technology (ICT)-based prompting methods have increased.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Also, we inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors reliably assessed trial quality and extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> For continuous outcomes, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups, again with 95% confidence intervals.
<MaM> A 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE was created, and we assessed included studies for risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified 35 references, with 25 studies, but we could only include two studies with a total of 358 participants.
<RES> The studies had a moderate risk of bias, and therefore risk overestimating any positive effects of ICT-based prompting.
<RES> Both included studies compared semi-automatised ICT-based prompting intervention with standard care groups in mental health outpatient care.
<RES> The interventions were SMS-message and an electronic assistant device.
<RES> One included study reported our primary outcome, compliance.
<RES> There was not any clear evidence that ICT-based prompts increase improvement in compliance (stop taking medication within six months n = 320, RR 1.11 CI 0.96 to 1.29, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> There was some low quality evidence that ICT-based prompts have small effects for: mental state (average change in specific symptom scores within three months n = 251, MD -0.30 CI -0.53 to -0.07; severity of illness within three months n = 251, MD -0.10 CI -0.13 to -0.07 and six months n = 251, MD -0.10 CI -0.13 to -0.07; average change in depressive scores within six months n = 251, RR 0.00 CI -0.28 to 0.28; global symptoms within three months n = 251, MD -0.10 CI -0.38 to -0.07; negative symptoms within three months n = 251, MD -0.10 CI -0.38 to 0.18 and six months n = 251, MD -0.30 CI -0.58 to 0.02, low quality evidence).
<RES> Level of insight improved more among people receiving ICT-based prompt compared with those in the control group at six months (n = 251, MD -0.10 CI -0.13 to -0.07).
<RES> ICT-based prompts also increased quality of life (average change in quality of life within six months n = 251, RR 0.50 CI 0.19 to 0.81, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Based on the existing data, there is no evidence that either intervention is less acceptable than the other (n = 347, 2 RCTs, RR 1.46 CI 0.70 to 3.05, low quality evidence).
<RES> Included studies did not report outcomes of service utilisation, behaviour, costs or adverse events.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence base on the effects of ICT-based prompts is still inconclusive.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cochrane Collaboration researchers conducted a review of the effects of pre-referral rectal artesunate for people with suspected severe malaria, living in rural areas without healthcare services.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant trials up to May 2014 they included only one randomized controlled trial.
<ABS> This trial was conducted at various sites across Ghana, Tanzania and Bangladesh, and enrolled 17,826 children and adults.
<ABS> What is severe malaria and how might pre-referral rectal artesunate reduce deaths?
<ABS> Severe malaria is a serious medical condition caused by infection with the Plasmodium parasite which typically causes vomiting, anaemia, fitting, coma, and death.
<ABS> It is treated by giving injections of antimalarial drugs, which need to be started as quickly as possible to reduce the risk of death and brain damage.
<ABS> In some rural areas where malaria is common, people have to travel for several hours to reach healthcare clinics and hospitals, and many die on the way.
<ABS> In these settings, people without formal healthcare education could be trained to give artesunate rectally to start treating malaria before transporting the patient to hospital.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> Only one trial evaluated rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment.
<ABS> In the African sites only, children aged 6 to 72 months were included in the trial; while in the Asian trial site, older children and adults were included.
<ABS> Young children in the African and Asian trial sites (aged 6 to 72 months) had fewer deaths with rectal artesunate than with placebo (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> However, in Asia among older children and adults, there were more deaths in those that received rectal artesunate (low quality evidence).
<ABS> In the African sites, 56% of children took longer than six hours to reach hospital whereas over 90% of people in the Asian site reached hospital within six hours.
<ABS> The unexpected finding of more deaths with rectal artesunate in older children and adults should be taken into account when forming national and local policies about pre-referral treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Severe or complicated malaria is a medical emergency and people die as a result of delays in starting treatment.
<INT> Most patients need parenteral treatment, and in primary healthcare facilities, where intravenous therapy is not available but intramuscular injections can be given, intramuscular quinine, artesunate, and artemether have been used before transporting patients to hospital.
<INT> However, in rural settings with limited access to health care, intramuscular injections may also be unavailable.
<INT> In these situations, rectal artesunate given prior to transfer to hospital by volunteers with little medical training, may be a feasible option.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE and LILACS up to 21 May 2014.
<MaM> We also searched the WHO clinical trial registry platform and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for ongoing trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for potentially eligible trials, and extracted data from the included trials.
<MaM> Dichotomous outcomes were summarized using risk ratios (RR) and presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
<MaM> Where data allowed, we conducted subgroup analyses by age, trial region and whether participants were included in the trial analysis.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One trial met the inclusion criteria; a placebo-controlled trial of 17,826 children and adults living in rural villages in Ghana and Tanzania (Africa) and Bangladesh (Asia).
<RES> Villagers with no previous medical training were trained to recognize the symptoms of severe malaria, administer rectal artesunate and refer patients to hospital.
<RES> The trained villagers were supervised during the trial period.
<RES> In the African sites only children aged 6 to 72 months were enrolled, whereas in Bangladesh, older children and adults were also enrolled.
<RES> In young children (aged 6 to 72 months) there were fewer deaths following rectal artesunate than with placebo (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.93; one trial; 8050 participants; moderate quality evidence), while in older children and adults there were more deaths in those given rectal artesunate (RR 2.21; 95% CI 1.18 to 4.15; one trial; 4018 participants; low quality evidence).
<RES> In Africa, only 56% of participants reached a secondary healthcare facility within six hours compared to over 90% in Asia.
<RES> There were no differences between the intervention and control groups in the proportion of participants reaching a healthcare facility within six hours (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; 12,068 participants), or in the proportion with parasitaemia (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02; 17,826 participants), or with coma or convulsions on arrival (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 12,068 participants).
<RES> There are no existing trials that compare rectal versus intramuscular artesunate.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Botulinum toxin for swallowing disorders

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Many people have problems swallowing because of an impairment of the upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS), a high pressure zone within the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.
<ABS> Many people with neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis can have UOS impairment.
<ABS> This results in difficulty swallowing food and liquids, resulting in choking and food entering into the lungs (aspiration).
<ABS> This has serious consequences for the patient and can cause dehydration, malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia.
<ABS> The person's quality of life can be affected as they are unable to have food or liquids safely by mouth.
<ABS> Tube feeding and hospitalisation is often required.
<ABS> Many interventions are used to improve UOS function.
<ABS> These include surgery, medications including botulinum toxin, rehabilitation exercises, diet modification and other compensatory techniques.
<ABS> There is no clear consensus on whether botulinum toxin is safe and effective in managing UOS dysfunction in people with neurological conditions.
<ABS> This makes it hard to decide which intervention will be safest and most effective to improve swallowing and quality of life.
<ABS> Only randomised controlled trials were sought for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Trials were looked for through electronic searches of databases, searches of clinical trials registers, from peer reviewed journals, published conference proceedings and reference lists of relevant articles.
<ABS> No trials met the inclusion criteria for the review.
<ABS> There is insufficient evidence to support the use of botulinum toxin to improve swallowing in people with UOS dysfunction and neurological disease.
<ABS> Adequately powered well designed trials are required.
<ABS> In addition to using sensitive measures looking at changes in swallow function, measures are needed that examine client and caregiver satisfaction, changes in quality of life, psychological well-being and unwanted symptoms associated with the intervention.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Adequate upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) opening is critical to safe and efficient swallowing due to the close proximity of the UOS to the airway entrance.
<INT> Many people with neurological conditions, progressive and non-progressive, present with UOS dysfunction.
<INT> The consequences for the person include difficulty swallowing food with subsequent choking and aspiration (passage of material into the trachea beyond the level of the true vocal cords).
<INT> Clinical complications include aspiration pneumonia, weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition.
<INT> Tube feeding is often indicated but is associated with increased mortality.
<INT> Quality of life is also frequently impacted.
<INT> A range of interventions exist that aim to improve UOS function and swallowing.
<INT> These include compensatory strategies, rehabilitation techniques, pharmacological interventions and surgery.
<INT> Over the last two decades, botulinum toxin has been gaining popularity as an intervention for UOS dysfunction, with some evidence to suggest that it is successful in improving swallow function.
<INT> Despite a number of studies investigating its efficacy, there is a lack of consensus regarding whether this intervention is effective in improving swallowing for individuals with UOS dysfunction associated with neurological disease.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To establish the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin use

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases for published trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 2013); EMBASE (1980 to 2013); AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (1941 to 2013); CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1937 to 2013).
<MaM> We also searched major clinical trials registers: CCT (http://www.controlled-trials.com); Clinical Trials (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov); Chinese Clinical Trial Register (www.chictr.org); ACTR (http://www.actr.org.au/.
<MaM> We examined the reference lists of all potentially relevant studies to identify further relevant trials.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Only randomised controlled trials were sought.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Independent searches were completed by JR, AM, MC and MW.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No randomised controlled studies were retrieved.
<RES> Twenty-nine studies were excluded, mainly on the basis of trial design.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice.
<CON> Directions for future research are provided.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is a nursing handover?
<ABS> A nursing handover occurs when one nurse hands over the responsibility of care for a patient to another nurse, for example, at the end of a nursing shift.
<ABS> On average, nursing handovers occur three times a day for each patient.
<ABS> What styles of nursing handover exist?
<ABS> In some cases they are done at the patient’s bedside, so that the patient can contribute, if desired.
<ABS> Why does the style of nursing handovers need to be investigated?
<ABS> When a nurse hands over responsibility of care to another nurse there is an opportunity for error if all the important medical information is not shared thoroughly and efficiently.
<ABS> Failing to mention - or grasp - information may result in delays in treatment or diagnosis for the patient, inappropriate treatment, or failure to provide appropriate care.
<ABS> Consequently, an accurate handover of clinical information is essential to ensure continuity of care and patients’ safety.
<ABS> The purpose and findings of this review
<ABS> This review tried to find out which nursing handover style works best.
<ABS> In March 2013 the review authors conducted a wide search for suitable relevant studies (randomised controlled studies) that compared different styles of nursing handover.
<ABS> However, they were not able to identify any randomised controlled studies that investigated the question, and so could draw no conclusions.
<ABS> Further research in this area is urgently needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> An accurate handover of clinical information is of great importance to continuity and safety of care.
<INT> During the last decade the call for interventions to improve handovers has increased.
<INT> These interventions aim to reduce the risk of miscommunication, misunderstanding and the omission of critical information.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve hospital nursing handover, specifically:

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases for primary studies: Cochrane EPOC Group specialised register (to 19 September 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to 1 March 2013), MEDLINE (1950 to 1 March 2013) OvidSP, EMBASE (1947 to 1 March 2013) OvidSP, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1980 to 1 March 2013) EbscoHost and ISI Web of Knowledge (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index) (to 9 July 2012).
<MaM> The Database of Abstracts of Reviews (DARE) was searched for related reviews.
<MaM> We screened the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.
<MaM> We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/ and Current Controlled Trials www.controlled-trials.com/mrct and we conducted a search of grey literature web sites.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search identified 2178 citations, 28 of which were considered potentially relevant.
<RES> After independent review of the full text of these studies, no eligible studies were identified for inclusion in this review due to the absence of studies with a randomised controlled study design.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There was no evidence available to support conclusions about the effectiveness of nursing handover styles for ensuring continuity of information in hospitalised patients because we found no studies that fulfilled the methodological criteria for this review.
<CON> As a consequence, uncertainty about the most effective practice remains.
<CON> Research efforts should focus on strengthening the evidence abut the effectiveness of nursing handover styles using well designed, rigorous studies.
<CON> According to current knowledge, the following guiding principles can be applied when redesigning the nursing handover process: face-to-face communication, structured documentation, patient involvement and use of IT technology to support the process.

<H1> Psychological interventions for acute pain after open heart surgery

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Psychological treatments to reduce pain in people undergoing open heart surgery

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute postoperative pain is one of the most disturbing complaints in open heart surgery, and is related to a risk of negative consequences such as impaired wound healing, chronic pain or depression.
<ABS> Psychological treatment is designed to improve patients' knowledge and to alter surgery-related mental distress, negative beliefs and non-compliance.
<ABS> It aims to reduce pain and anxiety, and to improve the post-operative recovery after open heart surgery.
<ABS> Psychological treatment comprises the provision of information about medical procedures and associated emotional responses and sensations before, during and after surgery, and instructions about how to adhere to medical advice to support the recovery; teaching or instructing patients in different relaxation techniques; or helping patients to understand their thoughts and feelings that influence their behaviours.
<ABS> This review investigated whether psychological treatment could successfully reduce acute postoperative pain and improve the course of physical and psychological recovery of people undergoing open heart surgery.
<ABS> We found 19 studies including a total of 2164 participants which reported effects of psychological treatment compared to a control group on pain intensity, use of pain medication, mental distress, mobility and duration of intubation after surgery.
<ABS> We did not find evidence that psychological treatment reduces pain intensity or enhances mobility after open heart surgery.
<ABS> Psychological treatment proved to be slightly better than standard care in reducing mental distress.
<ABS> We did not find clear evidence that psychological treatment leads to a reduced intubation time after surgery.
<ABS> No adverse effect of psychological treatment was described in any primary study.
<ABS> However, studies were of low quality in general, and there was also variation between the results of studies.
<ABS> The latest search was conducted in September 2013.
<ABS> Studies were mostly conducted without external financial support or funded by non-commercial national or regional research associations or student fellowships.
<ABS> Conflicts of interest were not stated in any study.
<ABS> Further research of high quality is required to answer the question of whether psychological treatment has the potential to reduce postoperative pain and improve recovery after open heart surgery.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute postoperative pain is one of the most disturbing complaints in open heart surgery, and is associated with a risk of negative consequences.
<INT> Several trials investigated the effects of psychological interventions to reduce acute postoperative pain and improve the course of physical and psychological recovery of participants undergoing open heart surgery.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to September 2013), EMBASE (1980 to September 2013), Web of Science (all years to September 2013), and PsycINFO (all years to September 2013) for eligible studies.
<MaM> We used the 'related articles' and 'cited by' options of eligible studies to identify additional relevant studies.
<MaM> We also checked lists of references of relevant articles and previous reviews.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (SK and JR) independently assessed trials for eligibility, estimated the risk of bias and extracted all data.
<MaM> We calculated effect sizes for each comparison (Hedges’ g) and meta-analysed data using a random-effects model.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Nineteen trials were included (2164 participants).
<RES> No study reported data on the number of participants with pain intensity reduction of at least 50% from baseline.
<RES> Only one study reported data on the number of participants below 30/100 mm on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in pain intensity.
<RES> Psychological interventions have no beneficial effects in reducing pain intensity measured with continuous scales in the medium-term interval (g -0.02, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.20, 4 studies, 413 participants, moderate quality evidence) nor in the long-term interval (g 0.12, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.33, 3 studies, 280 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> No study reported data on median time to remedication or on number of participants remedicated.
<RES> Only one study provided data on postoperative analgesic use.
<RES> Studies reporting data on mental distress in the medium-term interval revealed a small beneficial effect of psychological interventions (g 0.36, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.62, 12 studies, 1144 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Likewise, a small beneficial effect of psychological interventions on mental distress was obtained in the long-term interval (g 0.28, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.51, 11 studies, 1320 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> There were no beneficial effects of psychological interventions on mobility in the medium-term interval (g 0.23, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.67, 3 studies, 444 participants, low quality evidence) nor in the long-term interval (g 0.29, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.71, 4 studies, 423 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Only one study reported data on time to extubation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> For the majority of outcomes (two-thirds) we could not perform a meta-analysis since outcomes were not measured, or data were provided by one trial only.
<CON> Psychological interventions have no beneficial effects on reducing postoperative pain intensity or enhancing mobility.
<CON> There is low quality evidence that psychological interventions reduce postoperative mental distress.
<CON> Due to limitations in methodological quality, a small number of studies, and large heterogeneity, we rated the quality of the body of evidence as low.
<CON> Future trials should measure crucial outcomes (e.g. number of participants with pain intensity reduction of at least 50% from baseline) and should focus to enhance the quality of the body of evidence in general.
<CON> Altogether, the current evidence does not clearly support the use of psychological interventions to reduce pain in participants undergoing open heart surgery.


<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The risk of a future postnatal recurrence is 25% to 57%.
<INT> Mood stabilisers, antipsychotic drugs and hormone therapy may be beneficial in the prevention of postnatal psychotic episodes in women at risk.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> All randomised controlled trials relevant to the prevention of postnatal psychosis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors inspected all citations to ensure reliable selection.
<MaM> If we had included relevant trials, we planned to assess the methodological quality of identified trials using the criteria recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
<MaM> Two review authors would have independently extracted data.
<MaM> For homogenous dichotomous data, we planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and the number needed to treat to benefit/harm (NNTB/NNTH) on an intention-to-treat basis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> There are no included studies in this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This is not an empty review - it is a review full of unanswered questions.
<CON> Despite growing interest in women’s mental health, the literature in the area of postnatal psychosis is still very limited.
<CON> It seems that clinicians have no choice but to continue with their current practices guided solely by varied clinical judgement.
<CON> Women at risk of postanal psychosis and their relatives are justified to be disappointed in the medical/research fraternity.
<CON> A post hoc PubMed topic (not methodology-specific) search identified mainly case series.
<CON> Policy makers have no trial-based evidence upon which to base their guidelines.
<CON> Certainly, preventive interventions for postnatal psychosis are difficult to justify with confidence without well-designed, well-conducted, and well-reported randomised studies.
<CON> Available publications suggest that such studies are possible and funders of research may wish to make this work a priority.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Can vocational rehabilitation help workers return to work after having injured their fingers, hand or arm?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Injuries sustained to fingers, hand, or arm can seriously limit a person's ability to continue working normally.
<ABS> In many countries law compels employers to help injured workers when the injury affects their work ability.
<ABS> This help is often referred to as vocational rehabilitation.
<ABS> What is vocational rehabilitation?
<ABS> Vocational rehabilitation consists of a range of ways to help disabled workers return to work or to find a new job.
<ABS> Return-to-work (RTW) can be supported by helping the injured worker cope better, by workplace adjustments, or by physical exercises.
<ABS> Although all these strategies are used in practice, there is no evidence in the form of systematic reviews on which approach is best and in which circumstances.
<ABS> What does the research show?
<ABS> We examined all the published research up to 5 May 2013.
<ABS> We wanted to include studies only if getting vocational rehabilitation or some other treatment was determined by chance.
<ABS> This way of conducting research, known as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to ensure that any measured improvement is really caused by the treatment.
<ABS> We did not find any RCTs that had studied if vocational rehabilitation can help workers with upper limb injuries return to work.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> There is no evidence from RCTs to say if vocational rehabilitation can help workers with upper limb injuries return to work.
<ABS> We need RCTs conducted with workers with upper limb injuries to see if vocational rehabilitation can improve their RTW.
<ABS> These studies should be conducted and reported according to agreed standards for high quality research.
<ABS> They should describe the content of vocational rehabilitation in detail.
<ABS> They should also report the number of workers that have returned to work at the end of follow-up or the time it took for them to return to work.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Traumatic upper limb injury is a leading cause of work-related disability.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently inspected abstracts and we obtained full papers when necessary.
<MaM> When the two authors disagreed about the inclusion of a study, we resolved disagreements by discussion.
<MaM> A third author arbitrated when necessary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Our search identified 332 citations.
<RES> In the end, none of these 15 citations met our inclusion criteria.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Self management programmes have been advocated as a means to help people with asthma achieve better levels of asthma control and better asthma-related outcomes.
<ABS> However, there are a number of barriers affecting the successful implementation and uptake of these programmes.
<ABS> These barriers call for innovative approaches for the delivery of self management programmes.
<ABS> Of particular interest is the use of consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers as a means of delivering these programmes within the existing healthcare configuration.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review assessed whether smartphone and tablet computer apps are effective tools for supporting patients with asthma to self manage their own condition.
<ABS> Description of the studies
<ABS> We included two studies with a total of 408 participants.
<ABS> Both studies evaluated the effect of a mobile phone-based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper-based asthma self management.
<ABS> One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations.
<ABS> In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three-colour traffic light display on their phones.
<ABS> Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Due to the lack of enough included studies and the considerable differences between them, we were unable to obtain conclusive answers to our research question.
<ABS> One study showed that the use of a smartphone app can result in better asthma-related quality of life and lung function, and reduced visits to the emergency department.
<ABS> The other study failed to show any significant improvements in asthma-related outcomes after using a smartphone app as a delivery mechanism.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinicians, policy-makers and the general public with regards to the effectiveness of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of June 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Asthma is one of the most common long-term conditions worldwide, which places considerable pressure on patients, communities and health systems.
<INT> The major international clinical guidelines now recommend the inclusion of self management programmes in the routine management of patients with asthma.
<INT> These programmes have been associated with improved outcomes in patients with asthma.
<INT> However, the implementation of self management programmes in clinical practice, and their uptake by patients, is still poor.
<INT> Recent developments in mobile technology, such as smartphone and tablet computer apps, could help develop a platform for the delivery of self management interventions that are highly customisable, low-cost and easily accessible.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (CAGR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health Library, Compendex/Inspec/Referex, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, CiteSeerx and CAB abstracts via Web of Knowledge.
<MaM> We also searched registers of current and ongoing trials and the grey literature.
<MaM> We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references.
<MaM> We searched for studies published from 2000 onwards.
<MaM> The latest search was run in June 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methods expected by the Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two RCTs with a total of 408 participants.
<RES> We found no cluster RCTs, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review.
<RES> Both RCTs evaluated the effect of a mobile phone-based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper-based asthma self management.
<RES> One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations.
<RES> In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three-colour traffic light display on their phones.
<RES> Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma.
<RES> We did not conduct a meta-analysis of the data extracted due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between these studies.
<RES> Instead we adopted a narrative synthesis approach.
<RES> Overall, the results were inconclusive and we judged the evidence to have a GRADE rating of low quality because further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
<RES> In addition, there was not enough information in one of the included studies to assess the risk of bias for the majority of the domains.
<RES> Although the other included study was methodologically rigorous, it was not possible to blind participants or personnel in the study.
<RES> Moreover, there are concerns in both studies in relation to attrition bias and other sources of bias.
<RES> One study showed that the use of a smartphone app for the delivery of an asthma self management programme had no statistically significant effect on asthma symptom scores (mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.23 to 0.25), asthma-related quality of life (MD of mean scores 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39), unscheduled visits to the emergency department (OR 7.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 140.76) or frequency of hospital admissions (odds ratio (OR) 3.07, 95% CI 0.32 to 29.83).
<RES> The other included study found that the use of a smartphone app resulted in higher asthma-related quality of life scores at six-month follow-up (MD 5.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 9.52 for the physical component score of the SF-12 questionnaire; MD 6.00, 95% CI 2.51 to 9.49 for the mental component score of the SF-12 questionnaire), improved lung function (PEFR) at four (MD 27.80, 95% CI 4.51 to 51.09), five (MD 31.40, 95% CI 8.51 to 54.29) and six months (MD 39.20, 95% CI 16.58 to 61.82), and reduced visits to the emergency department due to asthma-related complications (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.99).
<RES> Both studies failed to find any statistical differences in terms of adherence to the intervention and occurrence of other asthma-related complications.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinical practitioners, policy-makers and the general public with regards to the use of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes.
<CON> In order to understand the efficacy of apps as standalone interventions, future research should attempt to minimise the differential clinical management of patients between control and intervention groups.
<CON> Those studies evaluating apps as part of complex, multicomponent interventions, should attempt to tease out the relative contribution of each intervention component.
<CON> Consideration of the theoretical constructs used to inform the development of the intervention would help to achieve this goal.
<CON> Finally, researchers should also take into account: the role of ancillary components in moderating the observed effects, the seasonal nature of asthma and long-term adherence to self management practices.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Our aim in this review was to find out how well mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) works and how safe it is to use in people with neuromuscular disorders (diseases of the peripheral nerves or muscles) who have breathing problems.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> People with neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) sometimes have weak breathing muscles.
<ABS> This can make it difficult for them to cough and clear mucus from the lungs well, putting them at risk of repeated chest infections and ongoing lung disease.
<ABS> MI-E is one of a number of methods used to improve cough and mucus clearance.
<ABS> MI-E is given through a mask, mouthpiece, or via a tracheostomy (an opening in the neck into the windpipe).
<ABS> MI-E acts like a cough by first pushing air into the lungs when the person breathes in (insufflation), then sucking it out again (exsufflation).
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> We carried out a wide database search for trials of MI-E in people with NMDs.
<ABS> We only included trials in which people were assigned to the treatments by chance, as these studies provide the best quality evidence.
<ABS> Results and quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found five trials, with 105 people.
<ABS> They all studied the immediate effects of a single treatment with MI-E.
<ABS> The studies compared MI-E to other ways of helping people cough, or normal cough without help.
<ABS> One trial studied MI-E when added to other treatment.
<ABS> Based on three trials, MI-E may improve the outwards flow of air during coughing compared to a normal cough without help.
<ABS> MI-E was not clearly better than other methods of improving cough.
<ABS> None of the studies measured the outcomes that we thought were important for making decisions about the usefulness of MI-E.
<ABS> For example, the studies did not report on survival, length of hospital stay, quality of life, or serious side effects.
<ABS> One study reported extreme tiredness as a side effect of MI-E.
<ABS> There was often not enough information in the reports to tell whether the studies were well run; in some we found design problems that could have affected the results.
<ABS> The findings of this review do not give enough evidence on which to make decisions.
<ABS> We were unable to find any information from trials on important short- and long-term effects, including side effects of MI-E in NMDs.
<ABS> There is currently insufficient evidence for or against the use of MI-E to help people with NMDs clear mucus from their lungs.
<ABS> Further studies are needed to better understand the benefits and risks of MI-E in relation to other methods of cough assistance.
<ABS> The evidence in the review is up to date as of 7 October 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This places them at risk of recurrent chest infections and chronic lung disease.
<INT> Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) is one of a number of techniques available to improve cough efficacy and mucus clearance.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the efficacy and safety of MI-E in people with NMDs.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 7 October 2013, we searched the following databases from inception: the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, and EMBASE.
<MaM> We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials.
<MaM> We conducted handsearches of reference lists and conference proceedings.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We considered comparisons of MI-E with no treatment, or alternative cough augmentation techniques.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in included studies according to standard Cochrane methodology.
<MaM> The primary outcome was mortality throughout follow-up or at six months follow-up.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Five studies with a total of 105 participants were found to be eligible for inclusion in this review.
<RES> All included trials were short-term studies (two days or less), measuring immediate effects of the interventions.
<RES> There was insufficient detail in the reports to assess methods of randomisation and allocation concealment.
<RES> All five studies were at a high risk of bias from lack of blinding.
<RES> The studies did not report on mortality, morbidity, quality of life, serious adverse events or any of the other prespecified outcomes.
<RES> One study was a randomised cross-over trial conducted over two days, in which investigators applied two interventions twice daily in randomly assigned order, with a reverse cross-over the following day.
<RES> Four studies applied multiple interventions for cough augmentation to each participant, in random order.
<RES> One study reported fatigue as an adverse effect of MI-E, using a visual analogue scale.
<RES> Peak cough expiratory flow (PCEF) was the most common outcome measure and was reported in four studies.
<RES> Based on three studies, MI-E may improve PCEF compared to an unassisted cough.
<RES> All interventions increased PCEF to the critical level necessary for mucus clearance.
<RES> The included studies did not clearly show that MI-E improves cough expiratory flow more than other cough augmentation techniques.
<RES> Based on one study, which was at risk of assessor bias, the addition of MI-E may reduce treatment time when added to a standard airway clearance regimen with manually assisted cough.
<RES> MI-E appeared to be as well tolerated as other cough augmentation techniques, based on three studies which reported comfort visual analogue scores.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently insufficient evidence for or against the use of MI-E in people with NMDs.
<CON> Further randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to test the safety and efficacy of MI-E.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Antibodies for preventing measles after exposure

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People who have had measles, or measles vaccine, have antibodies against the virus in their blood that protect them from developing measles should they come into contact with it.
<ABS> These antibodies can be extracted from blood donated by these individuals.
<ABS> If people without antibodies come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles, they are likely to contract the disease.
<ABS> Measles is usually debilitating and can have serious consequences including death, so preventing it is desirable.
<ABS> One way of preventing measles in this group, when they do come into contact with a contagious person, is to inject them with antibodies that have been extracted from blood donations.
<ABS> This has been practised since the 1920s, but measures of its effectiveness have varied and the minimum amount of antibodies that we can give to prevent measles is unknown.
<ABS> Based on seven studies (1432 people), of overall moderate quality, injecting antibodies into a muscle of people who came into contact with measles, but lacked their own antibodies, was effective at preventing them catching the disease compared to those who received no treatment.
<ABS> Using the modern day antibody preparation, people were 83% less likely to develop measles than those who were not treated.
<ABS> It was very effective at preventing them developing complications if they did contract measles and very effective at preventing death.
<ABS> The included studies generally did not intend to measure possible harms from the injections.
<ABS> Minor side effects were reported, such as muscle stiffness, redness around the injection site, fever and rash.
<ABS> Importantly, only two studies compared the measles vaccine with the antibody injection in this group of people, so no firm conclusions could be drawn about the relative effectiveness of these interventions.
<ABS> The antibody injection is often recommended for pregnant women, infants and immunocompromised people (if they do not have their own antibodies to measles and come into contact with someone who is contagious with measles).
<ABS> The included studies did not include these groups of people, so it is unknown whether the effectiveness of antibody injections is different for them.
<ABS> We were also unable to identify the minimum dose of antibodies required as only one study measured the specific amount of measles antibodies in the injections and one other study estimated this figure; the results of these two studies were not consistent.
<ABS> The evidence is current to August 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Measles outbreaks continue to occur in countries with high vaccination coverage.
<INT> Estimates of effectiveness have varied and no minimum effective dose has been determined.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We excluded studies of other sources of immunoglobulins.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and critically appraised the included studies.
<MaM> We attempted to contact study authors for missing information.
<MaM> We described the results of studies not included in meta-analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one RCT, two quasi-RCTs and 10 cohort studies (3925 participants).
<RES> No studies were rated as low risk of bias for all criteria.
<RES> Critical appraisal was constrained by a lack of information in most studies.
<RES> The overall quality of the evidence was moderate.
<RES> Seven studies (1432 participants) assessed cases of measles after immunoglobulin versus no treatment.
<RES> Heterogeneity was explained by subgrouping according to the blood product used as an approximation of dose of immunoglobulin.
<RES> When given within seven days of exposure, immunoglobulins were effective at preventing measles: gamma globulin (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.36), convalescent serum (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.29 to RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.54) and adult serum (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.59).
<RES> The differences in the effectiveness of different blood products were supported by studies not included in the meta-analysis and by two studies (702 participants) that found gamma globulin more effective than serum (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69).
<RES> Based on three studies (893 participants) immunoglobulin was effective at preventing death due to measles compared to no treatment (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.44).
<RES> Two studies included measles vaccine alone among the intervention groups.
<RES> Meta-analysis could not be undertaken.
<RES> Both studies suggested the vaccine was more effective than gamma globulin.
<RES> No serious adverse events were observed in any of the included studies, although reporting of adverse events was poor overall.
<RES> Non-serious adverse events included transient fever, rash, muscle stiffness, local redness and induration.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Passive immunisation within seven days of exposure is effective at preventing measles, with the risk for non-immune people up to 83% less than if no treatment is given.
<CON> Given an attack rate of 45 per 1000 (per the control group of the most recent included study), gamma globulin compared to no treatment has an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 37 per 1000 and a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 27.
<CON> Given an attack rate of 759 per 1000 (per the attack rate of the other included study assessing gamma globulin), the ARR of gamma globulin compared to no treatment is 629 and the NNTB is two.
<CON> It seems the dose of immunoglobulin administered impacts on effectiveness.
<CON> A minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies could not be identified.
<CON> Passive immunisation is effective at preventing deaths from measles, reducing the risk by 76% compared to no treatment.
<CON> Whether the benefits of passive immunisation vary among subgroups of non-immune exposed people could not be determined.
<CON> Due to a paucity of evidence comparing vaccine to passive immunisation, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding relative effectiveness.
<CON> The included studies were not specifically designed to detect adverse events.
<CON> Future research should consider the effectiveness of passive immunisation for preventing measles in high-risk populations such as pregnant women, immunocompromised people and infants.
<CON> Further efforts should be made to determine the minimum effective dose of measles-specific antibodies for post-exposure prophylaxis and the relative effectiveness of vaccine compared to immunoglobulin.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Sulthiame monotherapy for epilepsy

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Sulthiame monotherapy for epilepsy 

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Three randomised controlled trials with a total of 246 participants have been conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of sulthiame as monotherapy in epilepsy.
<ABS> Two studies have been conducted on benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, and one study has been conducted on generalised tonic-clonic seizures.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, significant risk of bias and the absence of data on important outcome measures and, in the case of one study, the lack of an English translation of the full-text manuscript.
<ABS> As a result, this review can draw no meaningful conclusions on the efficacy or safety of sulthiame as monotherapy in epilepsy.
<ABS> Our search (carried out in October 2013) revealed two ongoing studies on the use of sulthiame as monotherapy in benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes, the results of which may facilitate a more meaningful analysis in future updates of this review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is a common neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures.
<INT> Sulthiame (STM) is widely used as an antiepileptic drug in Europe and Israel.
<INT> In this review, we present a summary of evidence for the use of STM as monotherapy in epilepsy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (24 October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 24 October 2013), SCOPUS (1823 to 24 October 2013), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal (28 October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov (28 October 2013).
<MaM> We imposed no language restrictions.
<MaM> We contacted the manufacturers of STM and researchers in the field to ask about ongoing and unpublished studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data.
<MaM> Primary analyses were intention-to-treat when possible.
<MaM> A narrative analysis of the data was presented.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies representing 100 participants with a diagnosis of benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and one study representing 146 participants with a diagnosis of generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were included.
<RES> STM was given as monotherapy compared with placebo in the BECTS studies and compared with phenytoin in the GTCS study.
<RES> An English translation of the full text of one of the BECTS studies could not be found, and analysis of this study was based solely on the English translation of the abstract.
<RES> No data were reported for outcome (1), (2), (3) or (5).
<RES> Reporting of adverse effects was incomplete.
<RES> Participants receiving STM were significantly less likely to develop gingival hyperplasia than were participants receiving phenytoin in the GTCS study (risk ratio (RR) 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.58).
<RES> No further statistically significant adverse events were noted when STM was compared with phenytoin or placebo.
<RES> Two ongoing studies comparing STM monotherapy versus placebo or levetiracetam in BECTS were identified.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chromium picolinate supplementation for overweight or obese people

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Are chromium supplements useful for reducing body weight in overweight or obese adults?
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Chromium is an essential nutrient (trace element) required for the normal metabolism of carbohydrate, protein and fat (i.e. the chemical reactions involved in breaking down these molecules to a form suitable for absorption by the body).
<ABS> Chromium increases the activity of insulin, and dietary supplementation with chromium has produced improvements in glucose metabolism which may lower blood glucose being important for overweight people with diabetes.
<ABS> It is generally believed that chromium may help to reduce a person's weight by decreasing the amount of fat in the body.
<ABS> Chromium is also said to suppress the appetite and stimulate the production of heat by the body, thus increasing energy expenditure.
<ABS> This may contribute to weight loss.
<ABS> Chromium picolinate is one of several chemical compounds of chromium sold as a nutritional supplement as a potential aid to weight loss.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included nine randomised controlled trials which compared the efficacy and safety of 8 to 24 weeks of chromium supplementation and placebo in overweight or obese adults (i.e. with a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2 defining being overweight and a body mass index of 30kg/m2 or more defining obesity).
<ABS> A total of 622 participants took part in the studies, 346 participants received chromium picolinate and 276 received placebo.
<ABS> The evidence is current to December 2012.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> When the results obtained from the doses of chromium picolinate investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) were pooled, study participants lost around 1 kg of body weight more than participants receiving placebo.
<ABS> We were unable to find good evidence that this potential weight loss effect increased with increasing dose of chromium picolinate.
<ABS> Only three of nine studies provided information on adverse events, so we were unable to determine whether chromium picolinate supplements are safe and whether any potential harms may increase with dose.
<ABS> In addition, the length of studies included was rather short (maximum of 24 weeks), so we were unable to determine any long-term effects of supplementation.
<ABS> No study reported whether supplementation was associated with increases in deaths from any cause or illnesses (such as myocardial infarction or stroke), or the health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects of supplementation.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was considered low and we have inadequate information from which to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of chromium picolinate supplementation in overweight or obese adults.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Obesity is a global public health threat.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of CrP supplementation in overweight or obese people.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We excluded studies including children, pregnant women or individuals with serious medical conditions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance.
<MaM> Screening for inclusion, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment were carried out by one author and checked by a second.
<MaM> We assessed the risk of bias by evaluating the domains selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias.
<MaM> We performed a meta-analysis of included trials using Review Manager 5.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We evaluated nine RCTs involving a total of 622 participants.
<RES> The RCTs were conducted in the community setting, with interventions mainly delivered by health professionals, and had a short- to medium-term follow up (up to 24 weeks).
<RES> Three RCTs compared CrP plus resistance or weight training with placebo plus resistance or weight training, the other RCTs compared CrP alone versus placebo.
<RES> We focused this review on investigating which dose of CrP would prove most effective versus placebo and therefore assessed the results according to CrP dose.
<RES> However, in order to find out if CrP works in general, we also analysed the effect of all pooled CrP doses versus placebo on body weight only.
<RES> Across all CrP doses investigated (200 µg, 400 µg, 500 µg, 1000 µg) we noted an effect on body weight in favour of CrP of debatable clinical relevance after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment: mean difference (MD) -1.1 kg (95% CI -1.7 to -0.4); P = 0.001; 392 participants; 6 trials; low-quality evidence (GRADE)).
<RES> No firm evidence and no dose gradient could be established when comparing different doses of CrP with placebo for various weight loss measures (body weight, body mass index, percentage body fat composition, change in waist circumference).
<RES> Only three studies provided information on adverse events (low-quality evidence (GRADE)).
<RES> There were two serious adverse events and study dropouts in participants taking 1000 µg CrP, and one serious adverse event in an individual taking 400 µg CrP.
<RES> Two participants receiving placebo discontinued due to adverse events; one event was reported as serious.
<RES> No study reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> What is the medical problem?
<ABS> Muscle, ligament and tendon injuries frequently occur during activities such as sports, and may be due to tissue degeneration.
<ABS> These injuries are more frequent in particular parts of the body, such as the tendons located in the shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle.
<ABS> What treatments are available?
<ABS> Several treatment options are available.
<ABS> These include conservative methods, such as physical therapy, and surgery, for example to repair torn tendons.
<ABS> Another, increasingly popular, therapy is platelet-rich therapy.
<ABS> What is platelet-rich therapy?
<ABS> Platelets form part of blood.
<ABS> They produce growth factors that assist in repair and regeneration of tissue.
<ABS> It is possible that if a high concentration of platelets is applied to an injury, healing may progress faster.
<ABS> Platelet-rich therapy involves the production of a platelet-rich (concentrated) fraction of the patient's own blood.
<ABS> This is then applied, such as by an injection, to the site of injury.
<ABS> Does it work?
<ABS> This review set out to examine the evidence to see if platelet-rich therapy (PRT) works in practice.
<ABS> We searched medical databases (until March 2013) and registers of new studies (until March 2012) and found 19 studies that compared PRT with a control condition (such as no PRT).
<ABS> These involved a total of 1088 participants.
<ABS> Most participants were men, except in trials involving shoulder (rotator cuff) injuries, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies (sometimes called tendinitis), where similar numbers of women were included.
<ABS> The 19 trials covered eight types of injury, some of which were being treated surgically: rotator cuff tears (surgical repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome (surgery to release trapped tissues in the shoulder) (one trial); tennis elbow (three trials); knee ligament reconstruction using a section of tendon from the patient (four trials); the donor site of the tendon used for knee ligament reconstruction (two trials); patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee) (one trial); Achilles tendinopathy (tendinitis) (one trial); and acute rupture of the Achilles tendon (surgical repair) (one trial).
<ABS> The quality of the evidence is very low, partly because most trials used flawed methods that mean their results may not be reliable.
<ABS> The trials also used different ways of preparing and applying the platelet-rich plasma.
<ABS> We were only able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 studies and 45% of participants.
<ABS> When we pooled the limited data that was available for all these conditions, we found very weak (very low quality) evidence for a slight benefit of PRT in pain in the short term (up to three months).
<ABS> However, pooled data do not show that PRT makes a difference in function in the short, medium or long term.
<ABS> There was weak evidence that suggested that adverse events (harms) occurred at comparable, low rates in people treated with PRT and people not treated with PRT.
<ABS> In terms of individual conditions, we were able to pool results from six studies and found no differences in long-term function between those who received PRT during rotator cuff surgery and those who did not.
<ABS> Pooled data for short-term function from three tennis elbow studies showed a slight benefit for people receiving PRT but it is uncertain if this difference would actually be meaningful for a patient.
<ABS> In conclusion, the available evidence is insufficient to to support the use of PRT for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries or show whether the effects of PRT vary according to the type of injury.
<ABS> Any future research in this area should bear in mind the several studies currently going on and should consider the need for standardisation of the PRP preparation.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Platelet-rich therapies are being used increasingly in the treatment of musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries such as ligament, muscle and tendon tears and tendinopathies.
<INT> These therapies can be used as the principal treatment or as an augmentation procedure (application after surgical repair or reconstruction).
<INT> Platelet-rich therapies are produced by centrifuging a quantity of the patient’s own blood and extracting the active, platelet-rich, fraction.
<INT> The platelet-rich fraction is applied to the injured tissue; for example, by injection.
<INT> Platelets have the ability to produce several growth factors, so these therapies should enhance tissue healing.
<INT> There is a need to assess whether this translates into clinical benefit.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched trial registers (to Week 2 2013) and conference abstracts (2005 to March 2012).
<MaM> No language or publication restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Primary outcomes were functional status, pain and adverse effects.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed each study's risk of bias.
<MaM> Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by arbitration by a third author.
<MaM> We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or missing data.
<MaM> Treatment effects were assessed using risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data, together with 95% confidence intervals.
<MaM> Where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed-effect model for RR and MD, and the random-effects model for SMD.
<MaM> The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included data from 19 small single centre trials (17 randomised and two quasi-randomised; 1088 participants) that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy.
<RES> These trials covered eight clinical conditions: rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (one trial); elbow epicondylitis (three trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (four trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application) (two trials), patellar tendinopathy (one trial), Achilles tendinopathy (one trial) and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (one trial).
<RES> We also grouped trials into 'tendinopathies' where platelet-rich therapy (PRT) injections were the main treatment (five trials), and surgical augmentation procedures where PRT was applied during surgery (14 trials).
<RES> Trial participants were mainly male, except in trials including rotator cuff tears, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies.
<RES> Three trials were judged as being at low risk of bias; the other 16 were at high or unclear risk of bias relating to selection, detection, attrition or selective reporting, or combinations of these.
<RES> The methods of preparing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) varied and lacked standardisation and quantification of the PRP applied to the patient.
<RES> We were able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 trials and 45% of participants.
<RES> The evidence for all primary outcomes was judged as being of very low quality.
<RES> Data assessing function in the short term (up to three months) were pooled from five trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions and used four different measures.
<RES> These showed no significant difference between PRT and control (SMD 0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.56; P value 0.13; I² = 35%; 273 participants; positive values favour PRT).
<RES> Medium-term function data (at six months) were pooled from six trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures.
<RES> These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.06; 95% CI -0.39 to 0.51; P value 0.79; I² = 64%; 262 participants).
<RES> Long-term function data (at one year) were pooled from 10 trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures.
<RES> These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.57; P value 0.12; I² = 66%; 484 participants).
<RES> Although the 95% confidence intervals indicate the possibility of a slightly poorer outcome in the PRT group up to a moderate difference in favour of PRT at short- and long-term follow-up, these do not translate into clinically relevant differences.
<RES> Data pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions showed a small reduction in short-term pain in favour of PRT on a 10-point scale (MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.48; I² = 0%; 175 participants).
<RES> The clinical significance of this result is marginal.
<RES> Four trials reported adverse events; another seven trials reported an absence of adverse events.
<RES> There was no difference between treatment groups in the numbers of participants with adverse effects (7/241 versus 5/245; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.59; I² = 0%; 486 participants).
<RES> In terms of individual conditions, we pooled heterogeneous data for long-term function from six trials of PRT application during rotator cuff tear surgery.
<RES> This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the two groups (324 participants).
<RES> Pooled data for short-term function for three elbow epicondylitis trials (179 participants) showed a statistically significant difference in favour of PRT, but the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.
<RES> The available evidence is insufficient to indicate whether the effects of PRT will differ importantly in individual clinical conditions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Overall, and for the individual clinical conditions, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of PRT for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.
<CON> Researchers contemplating RCTs should consider the coverage of currently ongoing trials when assessing the need for future RCTs on specific conditions.
<CON> There is need for standardisation of PRP preparation methods.

<H1> Yoga for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Yoga to prevent cardiovascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global health burden.
<ABS> Nevertheless, it is thought that the risk of CVD can be lowered by changing a number of risk factors, such as by increasing physical activity and using relaxation to reduce stress, both of which are components of yoga.
<ABS> This review assessed the effectiveness of any type of yoga in healthy adults and those at high risk of CVD.
<ABS> Study Characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of yoga on adults at high risk of developing CVD.
<ABS> We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes).
<ABS> The evidence is current to December 2013.
<ABS> Key Results
<ABS> None of the included trials reported adverse events, the occurrence of type 2 diabetes or costs.
<ABS> Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of yoga for CVD prevention.
<ABS> Quality of the Evidence
<ABS> These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution.
<ABS> This is because the included studies were of short duration, small and at risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A sedentary lifestyle and stress are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD.
<MaM> Trials examined any type of yoga and the comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention.
<MaM> Outcomes of interest were clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors.
<MaM> We did not include any trials that involved multifactorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss.

<MaM> Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 11 trials (800 participants) and two ongoing studies.
<RES> Style and duration of yoga differed between trials.
<RES> Half of the participants recruited to the studies were at high risk of CVD.
<RES> Most of studies were at risk of performance bias, with inadequate details reported in many of them to judge the risk of selection bias.
<RES> No study reported cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events, and most studies were small and short-term.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity between studies making it impossible to combine studies statistically for systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol.
<RES> Yoga was found to produce reductions in diastolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -2.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.52 to -1.28), which was stable on sensitivity analysis, triglycerides (MD -0.27 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.11) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD 0.08 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14).
<RES> However, the contributing studies were small, short-term and at unclear or high risk of bias.
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD -0.09 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.30), although there was moderate statistical heterogeneity.
<RES> Adverse events, occurrence of type 2 diabetes and costs were not reported in any of the included studies.
<RES> Quality of life was measured in three trials but the results were inconclusive.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The limited evidence comes from small, short-term, low-quality studies.
<CON> There is some evidence that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and uncertain effects on LDL cholesterol.
<CON> These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> A structured collateral interview regarding cognition and function (the IQCODE) for assessment of possible dementia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Numbers of people with dementia and other cognitive problems are increasing globally.
<ABS> Early diagnosis of dementia is recommended but there is no agreement on the best approach or how non-memory specialists should assess patients.
<ABS> A potential strategy is to interview friends or family of the subject to assess for change in function or cognition.
<ABS> Various methods of this collateral interview are available and the most commonly used is the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).
<ABS> We searched differing databases of published research for all papers relating to the accuracy of IQCODE for selecting those with dementia.
<ABS> We found eleven studies that tested diagnostic accuracy of IQCODE in community dwelling individuals, we were able to combine their findings to give a summary result.
<ABS> We compared two forms of IQCODE questionnaire and found that a short form with fewer questions was just as accurate as the original longer questionnaire.
<ABS> The overall accuracy of IQCODE was reasonable although not perfect.
<ABS> If IQCODE were to be used on its own for assessing large populations of older adults, it would label many people with dementia who do not have the disease and also miss the diagnosis in a substantial proportion.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Various tools exist for initial assessment of possible dementia with no consensus on the optimal assessment method.
<INT> Instruments that use collateral sources to assess change in cognitive function over time may have particular utility.
<INT> The most commonly used informant dementia assessment is the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE).
<INT> A synthesis of the available data regarding IQCODE accuracy will help inform cognitive assessment strategies for clinical practice, research and policy.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We sought to describe the accuracy of IQCODE (the index test) against a clinical diagnosis of dementia (the reference standard).
<OBJ> We explored the effect of varying the threshold IQCODE score used to define 'test positivity'.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following sources on 28 January 2013: ALOIS (Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), BIOSIS Previews (ISI Web of Knowledge), Web of Science with Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Knowledge), LILACS (BIREME).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We selected those studies performed in community settings that used (not necessarily exclusively) the IQCODE to assess for presence of dementia and, where dementia diagnosis was confirmed, with clinical assessment.
<MaM> Our intention with limiting the search to a 'community' setting was to include those studies closest to population level assessment.
<MaM> Within our predefined community inclusion criteria, there were relevant papers that fulfilled our definition of community dwelling but represented a selected population, for example stroke survivors.
<MaM> We included these studies but performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of these less representative populations on the summary results.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We screened all titles generated by the electronic database searches and abstracts of all potentially relevant studies were reviewed.
<MaM> We pre-specified analyses to describe the effect of IQCODE format (traditional or short form) and language of administration for the IQCODE.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> From 16,144 citations, 71 papers described IQCODE test accuracy.
<RES> We included 10 papers (11 independent datasets) representing data from 2644 individuals (n = 379 (14%) with dementia).
<RES> Using IQCODE cut-offs commonly employed in clinical practice (3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) the sensitivity and specificity of IQCODE for diagnosis of dementia across the studies were generally above 75%.
<RES> Taking an IQCODE threshold of 3.3 (or closest available) the sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85); specificity was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.90); positive likelihood ratio was 5.2 (95% CI 3.7 to 7.5) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.23 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.29).
<RES> Comparative analysis suggested no significant difference in the test accuracy of the 16 and 26-item IQCODE tests and no significant difference in test accuracy by language of administration.
<RES> There was little difference in sensitivity across our predefined diagnostic cut-points.
<RES> There was substantial heterogeneity in the included studies.
<RES> Sensitivity analyses removing potentially unrepresentative populations in these studies made little difference to the pooled data estimates.
<RES> The majority of included papers had potential for bias, particularly around participant selection and sampling.
<RES> The quality of reporting was suboptimal particularly regarding timing of assessments and descriptors of reproducibility and inter-observer variability.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Across the included studies there were issues with heterogeneity, several potential biases and suboptimal reporting quality.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Although technological devices, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, enable the child to hear spoken words, they fail to teach the child how to listen, how to process language or how to talk.
<ABS> Auditory-verbal therapy aims to improve the spoken language abilities of a child with hearing impairment to the level of a child with typical hearing by developing his or her listening skills independent of other cues such as speech reading and gestures.
<ABS> It focuses on the context of spoken communication within the family and uses hearing and speech as the primary methods of communication.
<ABS> For this reason, it is thought to be more effective in helping a child reach typical age-related milestones in speech and language acquisition.
<ABS> This review was undertaken to assess evidence on the effectiveness of auditory-verbal therapy in promoting spoken language development in children with permanent hearing impairments.
<ABS> Whilst many studies have examined the effectiveness of AVT, no studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review.
<ABS> Well-designed studies are urgently needed to examine the effectiveness of AVT in promoting spoken language development in children.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Congenital or early-acquired hearing impairment poses a major barrier to the development of spoken language and communication.
<INT> Early detection and effective (re)habilitative interventions are essential for parents and families who wish their children to achieve age-appropriate spoken language.
<INT> Auditory-verbal therapy (AVT) is a (re)habilitative approach aimed at children with hearing impairments.
<INT> AVT comprises intensive early intervention therapy sessions with a focus on audition, technological management and involvement of the child's caregivers in therapy sessions; it is typically the only therapy approach used to specifically promote avoidance or exclusion of non-auditory facial communication.
<INT> The primary goal of AVT is to achieve age-appropriate spoken language and for this to be used as the primary or sole method of communication.
<INT> AVT programmes are expanding throughout the world; however, little evidence can be found on the effectiveness of the intervention.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, speechBITE and eight other databases were searched in March 2013.
<MaM> We also searched two trials registers and three theses repositories, checked reference lists and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Comparison groups considered for inclusion were waiting list and treatment as usual controls.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Articles were independently assessed by two review authors for design and risk of bias.
<MaM> In addition to outcome data, a range of variables related to participant groups and outcomes were documented.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of 2233 titles and abstracts searched, only 13 abstracts appeared to meet inclusion criteria.
<RES> Thus, no studies are included in this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review confirms the lack of well-controlled studies addressing the use of AVT as an intervention for promoting spoken language development in children with permanent hearing impairments.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Patients undergoing general anaesthesia need to have their airway protected as they lose their normal reflexes.
<ABS> This is most commonly achieved by placing a tube down through the mouth and larynx into the trachea (a tracheal tube (TT)) and using this to ventilate the lungs.
<ABS> Supraglottic airway devices (SADs) offer an alternative; they extend from the mouth into the throat but sit above the larynx.
<ABS> We searched the databases to September 2012, to find controlled trials that had randomly assigned obese participants (with body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2) undergoing general anaesthesia to TT or SAD for airway management.
<ABS> We wanted to investigate the effect of airway type on risk of failed placement; serious complications and death; oxygenation of the blood during and after surgery; coughing, sore throat or hoarseness during or after placement; and time taken and number of attempts needed to fit the airway.
<ABS> We found two randomized studies with a total of 232 obese participants, both of which studied one model of SAD－the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA).
<ABS> The proportion of successful first attempts at airway placement did not differ between PLMA and TT, although it took approximately six seconds longer to place an SAD than a TT.
<ABS> We found significant postoperative reduction of almost 75% in episodes of low oxygen saturation and an improvement in mean oxygen saturation of 2.5% during recovery in the PLMA group.
<ABS> Postoperative cough was less common among participants in the PLMA group.
<ABS> Our findings are consistent with both increased and decreased risks of both sore throat and hoarseness in the PLMA group.
<ABS> Identifying optimal anaesthetic techniques for obese patients is a priority for research.
<ABS> We could not establish the safety of SAD use in obese patients.
<ABS> Large databases created from medical records may be needed to clarify this issue.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Tracheal intubation may be more difficult and risk of aspiration
<INT> Although SADs are now widely used, clinical concerns remain that their use for airway management in obese patients may increase the risk of serious complications.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched for eligible trials in the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 8, 2012), MEDLINE via Ovid (from 1985 to 9 September 2012) and EMBASE via Ovid (from 1985 to 9 September 2012).
<MaM> The Cochrane highly sensitive filter for randomized controlled trials was applied in MEDLINE and EMBASE.
<MaM> We also searched trial registers such as www.clinicaltrials.gov and the Current Controlled Clinical Trials Website (http://www.controlled-trials.com/) for ongoing trials.
<MaM> The start date of these searches was limited to 1985, shortly before the first SAD was introduced, in 1988.
<MaM> We undertook forward and backward citation tracing for key review articles and eligible articles identified through the electronic resources.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We considered all randomized controlled trials of participants aged 16 years and older with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 undergoing general anaesthesia.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, including information on adverse events.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for additional information.
<MaM> If sufficient data were available, results were presented as pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on random-effects models (inverse variance method).
<MaM> We employed the Chi2 test and calculated the I2 statistic to investigate study heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two eligible studies, both comparing the use of one model of SAD, the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA) with a TT, with a total study population of 232.
<RES> One study population underwent laparoscopic surgery.
<RES> The included studies were generally of high quality, but there was an unavoidable high risk of bias in the main airway variables, such as change of device or laryngospasm, as the intubator could not be blinded.
<RES> Many outcomes included data from one study only.
<RES> A total of 5/118 (4.2%) participants randomly assigned to PLMA across both studies were changed to TT insertion because of failed or unsatisfactory placement of the device.
<RES> Postoperative episodes of hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation < 92% whilst breathing air) were less common in the PLMA groups (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.72).
<RES> We found a significant postoperative difference in mean oxygen saturation, with saturation 2.54% higher in the PLMA group (95% CI 1.09% to 4.00%).
<RES> This analysis showed high levels of heterogeneity between results (I2 = 71%).
<RES> The leak fraction was significantly higher in the PLMA group, with the largest difference seen during abdominal insufflation－a 6.4% increase in the PLMA group (95% CI 3.07% to 9.73%).
<RES> No cases of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, mortality or serious respiratory complications were reported in either study.
<RES> We are therefore unable to present effect estimates for these outcomes.
<RES> In all, 2/118 participants with a PLMA suffered laryngospam or bronchospasm compared with 4/114 participants with a TT.
<RES> The pooled estimate shows a non-significant reduction in laryngospasm in the PLMA group (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.59).
<RES> Postoperative coughing was less common in the PLMA group (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31), and there was no significant difference in the risk of sore throat or dysphonia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.13).
<RES> On average, PLMA placement took 5.9 seconds longer than TT placement (95% CI 3 seconds to 8.8 seconds).
<RES> There was no significant difference in the proportion of successful first placements of a device, with 33/35 (94.2%) first-time successes in the PLMA group and 32/35 (91.4%) in the TT group.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We have inadequate information to draw conclusions about safety, and we can only comment on one design of SAD (the PLMA) in obese patients.
<CON> We conclude that during routine and laparoscopic surgery, PLMAs may take a few seconds longer to insert, but this is unlikely to be a matter of clinical importance.
<CON> A failure rate of 3% to 5% can be anticipated in obese patients.
<CON> However, once fitted, PLMAs provide at least as good oxygenation, with the caveat that the leak fraction may increase, although in the included studies, this did not affect ventilation.
<CON> We found significant improvement in oxygenation during and after surgery, indicating better pulmonary performance of the PLMA, and reduced postoperative coughing, suggesting better recovery for patients.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular block in paediatric patients

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed the evidence about whether neostigmine should be routinely used to prevent residual muscle paralysis in children who received muscle relaxants during surgery.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Neuromuscular blocks are drugs that cause paralysis of the skeletal muscles.
<ABS> They are used to facilitate certain surgical procedures.
<ABS> Residual muscle paralysis after surgery is associated with serious complications in children such as low oxygen content (hypoxia).
<ABS> Neostigimine is a drug that is used to reverse the effects of neuromuscular blocks.
<ABS> Neostigime reduces the risk of paralysis, but it can also cause children to feel sick and vomit and to produce excessive saliva and have a slow heart rate (bradycardia).
<ABS> As risk of residual paralysis is lower in children than in adults after neuromuscular blocks, the use of neostigmine in all surgeries performed on children should be carefully considered.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> This evidence is current to August 2013.
<ABS> We found no study that satisfied the inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found only one study that is awaiting classification.
<ABS> No RCTs supported, or argued against, the routine use of neostigmine to reverse neuromuscular block in paediatric patients.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> We found no relevant evidence.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Residual neuromuscular block is associated with serious postoperative complications.
<INT> Some anaesthesiologists use neostigmine to reverse neuromuscular blockade for all paediatric surgical patients.
<INT> However, the incidence of residual neuromuscular block may be lower in paediatric patients than in adults.
<INT> The use of neostigmine has also caused complications, such as postoperative nausea, vomiting, excessive salivation and bradycardia.
<INT> Therefore, whether neostigmine should be used routinely to reverse neuromuscular blockade in each paediatric patient is an important question for paediatric anaesthesiologists.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found no study that satisfied the inclusion criteria.
<RES> We found one study awaiting classification.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Aminoadamantanes for chronic hepatitis C

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Aminoadamantanes for chronic hepatitis C

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Hepatitis C virus is mainly transmitted by contact with infected blood.
<ABS> Chronic hepatitis C infection affects around 3% of the world's population and progresses slowly.
<ABS> Most patients present without symptoms, or with symptoms like fatigue or liver-related morbidity (illness).
<ABS> Frequently, the disease is discovered by coincidence because of abnormal laboratory results.
<ABS> Between 5% and 40% of all infected patients will develop severe liver damage, which can cause severe liver-related morbidities and eventually death.
<ABS> Current treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, and in some groups of patients these two agents are administered in combination with antiviral drugs such as telaprevir or boceprevir.
<ABS> It is then possible to eradicate the virus from the blood in at least 70% of patients with chronic hepatitis C, but the clinical effects are not known.
<ABS> Review questions and study characteristics
<ABS> The review includes 41 randomised clinical trials with a total of 6193 patients.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> This review shows that there seems to be no significant benefit of amantadine on hepatitis C-infected patients regarding all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity.
<ABS> We were unable to assess the effect of amantadine on quality of life due to lack of data from the trials.
<ABS> Furthermore, amantadine did not increase the proportion of patients with a sustained virological response which is clearance of the virus from the blood six months after treatment.
<ABS> We considered all the included trials to have a high risk of bias.
<ABS> Accordingly, the evidence from this review does not support the routine clinical use of amantadine.
<ABS> There is some justification for amantadine to be used in future randomised clinical trials.
<ABS> We found no randomised clinical trials assessing other aminoadamantanes, for example rimantadine.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin eradicates the virus from the blood six months after treatment (sustained virological response) in approximately 40% to 80% of infected patients, depending on the viral genotype.
<INT> New antiviral agents, such as boceprevir and telaprevir, in combination with standard therapy, can increase sustained virological response in genotype 1 infected patients to at least 70%.
<INT> There is therefore an unmet need for drugs that can achieve a higher proportion of sustained virological response.
<INT> Aminoadamantanes are antiviral drugs used for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data.
<MaM> We assessed for risks of systematic errors ('bias') using the 'Risk of bias' tool.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) and continuous data with mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> We used trial sequential analysis to assess the risk of random errors ('play of chance').
<MaM> We assessed quality using the GRADE system.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> All included trials compared amantadine versus placebo or no intervention.
<RES> Standard antiviral therapy was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in 40 trials.
<RES> The standard antiviral therapy, which was administered to both intervention groups, was interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, and peg interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, depending on the time when the trial was conducted.
<RES> When we meta-analysed all trials together, the overall results demonstrated no significant effects of amantadine, when compared with placebo or no intervention, on our all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity composite outcome (5/2353 (0.2%) versus 6/2264 (0.3%); RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.17; I² = 0%; 32 trials; very low quality).
<RES> There was also no significant effect on adverse events (288/2869 (10%) versus 293/2777 (11%); RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I² = 0%; 35 trials; moderate quality).
<RES> We used both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses.
<RES> Amantadine, when compared with placebo or no intervention, did not significantly influence the number of patients who failed to achieve a sustained virological response (1821/2861 (64%) versus 1737/2721 (64%); RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.02; I² = 35%; 35 trials; moderate quality).
<RES> However, in the subgroup using interferon plus ribavirin, amantadine decreased the number of patients who failed to achieve a sustained virological response (422/666 (63%) versus 447/628 (71%); RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96; I² = 41%; 11 trials; low quality).
<RES> Similar results were found for failure to achieve an end of treatment virological response.
<RES> Amantadine, when compared with placebo or no intervention, significantly decreased the number of patients without normalisation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum levels at the end of treatment (671/1141 (59%) versus 732/1100 (67%); RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; I² = 47%; 19 trials; low quality).
<RES> Amantadine, when compared with placebo or no intervention, did not significantly influence the end of follow-up biochemical response (1133/1896 (60%) versus 1151/1848 (62%); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; I² = 49%; 21 trials; low quality).
<RES> The observed beneficial effects could be true effects but could also be due to both systematic errors (bias) and random errors (play of chance).
<RES> The latter is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm or refute our findings.
<RES> We were not able to perform meta-analyses for failure of histological improvement or quality of life due to a lack of valid data.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review does not demonstrate any significant effects of amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity composite outcome and on adverse events in patients with hepatitis C; however, the median trial duration was 12 months, with a median follow-up of six months, which is not long enough to assess the composite outcome sufficiently.
<CON> Overall, we did not see an effect of amantadine on failure to achieve a sustained virological response.
<CON> Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of amantadine plus interferon-alpha and ribavirin seems to increase the number of patients achieving a sustained virological response.
<CON> This finding may be caused by both systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance), but it could also be real.
<CON> Based on the results of the overall evidence, it appears less likely that future trials assessing amantadine for patients with chronic hepatitis C will show strong benefits.
<CON> Therefore, it is probably advisable to wait for the results of trials assessing other direct-acting antiviral drugs.
<CON> In the absence of convincing evidence of benefit, the use of amantadine is justified in the context of randomised clinical trials assessing the effects of combination therapy.
<CON> We found a lack of evidence on other aminoadamantanes than amantadine.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review, carried out by authors of the Cochrane Oral Health Group, has been produced to assess the effects of antibiotics on pain and swelling in two conditions commonly responsible for causing dental pain when given with or without dental treatment (such as extraction, drainage of a swelling or root canal treatment).
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Dental pain is a common problem and can arise when the nerve within a tooth dies due to progressing decay or severe trauma.
<ABS> The tissue around the end of the root then becomes inflamed and this can lead to acute pain, which gets worse on biting.
<ABS> Without treatment, bacteria can infect the dead tooth and cause a dental abscess, which can lead to swelling and spreading infection that may be life threatening.
<ABS> The recommended treatment of this form of toothache is the removal the dead nerve and associated bacteria.
<ABS> This is usually done by dental extraction or root canal treatment.
<ABS> Antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is severe infection that has spread from the tooth.
<ABS> However, some dentists still routinely prescribe oral antibiotics to people with acute dental conditions that have no signs of spreading infection.
<ABS> Minimising inappropriate antibiotic prescribing is plays a key role in limiting the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
<ABS> Since dentists prescribe approximately 8% to 10% of all primary care antibiotics in developed countries, dental prescribing may contribute to antibiotic resistance.
<ABS> Therefore, it is important that antibiotics should only be used when they are clinically beneficial for the person.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The evidence on which this review is based was up to date as of 1 October 2013.
<ABS> We searched scientific databases and found two trials, with a 62 participants included in the analysis.
<ABS> Both trials were conducted at university dental schools in the USA and evaluated the use of oral antibiotics in the reduction of pain and swelling reported by adults after having the first stage of root canal treatment under local anaesthetic.
<ABS> The antibiotic used in both trials was penicillin VK and all participants also received painkillers.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The two studies included in the review reported that there were no clear differences in the pain or swelling reported by participants who received oral antibiotics compared with a placebo (a dummy treatment) when provided in conjunction with the first stage of root canal treatment and painkillers, but the studies were small and we could not exclude potentially important differences between groups.
<ABS> Neither study examined the effect of antibiotics delivered by themselves, without dental treatment.
<ABS> One trial reported side effects among participants: one person who received the placebo medication had diarrhoea and one person who received antibiotics experienced tiredness and reduced energy after their operation.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> We judged the quality of evidence to be very low.
<ABS> There is currently insufficient evidence to be able to determine the effects of antibiotics in these conditions.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life.
<INT> Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system.
<INT> Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions.
<INT> There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and within the community as a whole.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 October 2013).
<MaM> We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies.
<MaM> We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses.
<RES> Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo given in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth (no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise)).
<RES> We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias.
<RES> The primary outcome variables presented were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain).
<RES> One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants.
<RES> One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment).
<RES> Adverse effects as reported in one study were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group).
<RES> No studies reporting quality of life measurements were suitable for inclusion.
<RES> Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.
<RES> Two studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth.
<RES> Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy.
<RES> Participants in both trials received oral analgesics.
<RES> There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review.
<RES> The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours.
<RES> The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours.
<RES> The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality.
<RES> Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.
<RES> We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Hearing aids for tinnitus in people with hearing loss

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Tinnitus describes 'ringing', 'whooshing' or 'hissing' sounds that are heard in the absence of any corresponding external sound.
<ABS> About 10% of people experience tinnitus and for some it has a significant negative impact on their quality of life.
<ABS> Tinnitus is commonly associated with some form of hearing loss and is possibly the result of hearing loss-related changes in brain activity.
<ABS> It is logical to think, therefore, that providing people who have hearing loss and tinnitus with a hearing aid will not only improve their ability to hear sound but will also reduce their tinnitus symptoms.
<ABS> Hearing aids increase the volume at which people hear external sounds so this may help mask or cover up the tinnitus sound.
<ABS> They also improve communication, which may reduce the symptoms often associated with tinnitus such as stress or anxiety.
<ABS> Hearing aids may also improve tinnitus symptoms by reducing or reversing abnormal types of nerve cell activity that are thought to be related to tinnitus.
<ABS> The purpose of this review is to evaluate the evidence from high-quality clinical trials that try to work out the effects hearing aids have on people's tinnitus.
<ABS> We particularly wanted to look at how bothersome their tinnitus is, how depressed or anxious tinnitus patients are and whether hearing aid use has an effect on patterns of brain activity thought to be associated with tinnitus.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Our search identified just one randomised controlled trial which evaluated 91 participants who had tinnitus for at least six months and some degree of hearing loss.
<ABS> It compared those receiving hearing aids to those receiving sound generators.
<ABS> The average age of the patients was 38 and there were 40 women and 51 men.
<ABS> The study took place in two centres in Italy and the USA.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The result from the single study we reviewed was not definitive and was compatible with only small differences between the effect of hearing aids and sound generators.
<ABS> We also found another relevant study which has not yet been completed.
<ABS> We believe further high-quality trials are needed.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of this evidence is moderate to low.
<ABS> This review is up to date to August 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation.
<INT> Hearing loss is commonly co-morbid with tinnitus and so logic implies that amplification of external sounds by hearing aids will reduce perception of the tinnitus sound and the distress associated with it.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the search was 19 August 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three authors independently screened all selected abstracts.
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data and assessed those potentially suitable studies for risk of bias.
<MaM> For studies meeting the inclusion criteria, we used the mean difference (MD) to compare hearing aids with other interventions and controls.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One randomised controlled trial (91 participants) was included in this review.
<RES> We judged the trial to have a low risk of bias for method of randomisation and outcome reporting, and an unclear risk of bias for other criteria.
<RES> No non-randomised controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria were identified.
<RES> The included study measured change in tinnitus severity (primary measure of interest) using a tinnitus questionnaire measure, and change in tinnitus loudness (secondary measure of interest) on a visual analogue scale.
<RES> Other secondary outcome measures of interest, namely change in the psychoacoustic characteristics of tinnitus, change in self reported anxiety, depression and quality of life, and change in neurophysiological measures, were not investigated in this study.
<RES> The included study compared hearing aid use to sound generator use.
<RES> The estimated effect on change in tinnitus loudness or severity as measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score was compatible with benefits for both hearing aids or sound generators but no difference was found between the two alternative treatments (MD -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.92 to 6.12) (100-point scale); moderate quality evidence.
<RES> No negative or adverse events were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The current evidence base for hearing aid prescription for tinnitus is limited.
<CON> To be useful, future studies should make appropriate use of blinding and be consistent in their use of outcome measures.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Psychological therapies (Internet-delivered) for the management of chronic pain in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Chronic pain (i.e. pain lasting longer than three months) is common.
<ABS> Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) can help people to cope with pain, depression and disability that can occur with such pain.
<ABS> Treatments currently are delivered via hospital out-patient consultation (face-to-face) or more recently through the Internet.
<ABS> This review looks at the evidence for psychological therapies delivered via the Internet for adults with chronic pain.
<ABS> Four databases were searched up to November 2013.
<ABS> We found 15 trials that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> Four trials included individuals with headache pain, 10 trials included individuals with non-headache pain, and one trial included individuals with both headache and non-headache pain.
<ABS> We looked at data about pain, disability, depression, and anxiety immediately after the end of treatment and between 3 to 12 months follow-up.
<ABS> We also looked at how satisfied people were with the treatments, and its effects on their quality of life.
<ABS> We found that for people with headache pain, pain symptoms and disability scores improved immediately following the end of treatment.
<ABS> However, only two trials could be entered into each of these analyses and so findings should be treated with caution.
<ABS> For people with non-headache pain, pain, disability, depression, and anxiety improved immediately after the end of treatment.
<ABS> Disability was also improved at follow-up.
<ABS> Only one study recorded quality of life scores in individuals with headache pain, so we were unable to analyse the results.
<ABS> Three studies presented quality of life scores for individuals with non-headache pain immediately following treatment.
<ABS> We did not find that quality of life improved after receiving the therapy.
<ABS> No data could be analysed on treatment satisfaction/acceptability.
<ABS> We conclude that these findings are promising for psychological treatments delivered via the Internet for the management of chronic pain in adults, but more trials are needed to determine the efficacy of such therapies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic pain (i.e. pain lasting longer than three months) is common.
<INT> Psychological therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy) can help people to cope with pain, depression and disability that can occur with such pain.
<INT> Treatments currently are delivered via hospital out-patient consultation (face-to-face) or more recently through the Internet.
<INT> This review looks at the evidence for psychological therapies delivered via the Internet for adults with chronic pain.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with treatment/treatment acceptability and quality of life.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL (Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO from inception to November 2013 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological therapies delivered via the Internet to adults with a chronic pain condition.
<MaM> Potential RCTs were also identified from reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles.
<MaM> In addition, RCTs were also searched for in trial registries.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Peer-reviewed RCTs were identified and read in full for inclusion.
<MaM> We included studies if they used the Internet to deliver the primary therapy, contained sufficient psychotherapeutic content, and promoted self-management of chronic pain.
<MaM> Studies were excluded if the number of participants in any arm of the trial was less than 20 at the point of extraction.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria and data were extracted.
<MaM> Risk of bias assessments were conducted for all included studies.
<MaM> We categorised studies by condition (headache or non-headache conditions).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fifteen studies (N= 2012) were included in analyses.
<RES> We assessed the risk of bias for included studies as low overall.
<RES> We identified nine high 'risk of bias' assessments, 22 unclear, and 59 low 'risk of bias' assessments.
<RES> Most judgements of a high risk of bias were due to inadequate reporting.
<RES> Analyses revealed seven effects.
<RES> Participants with headache conditions receiving psychological therapies delivered via the Internet had reduced pain (number needed to treat to benefit = 2.72, risk ratio 7.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.67 to 19.84, p < 0.01) and a moderate effect was found for disability post-treatment (standardised mean difference (SMD) ‒0.65, 95% CI ‒0.91 to ‒0.39, p < 0.01).
<RES> However, only two studies could be entered into each analysis; hence, findings should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> There was no clear evidence that psychological therapies improved depression or anxiety post-treatment (SMD −0.26, 95% CI −0.87 to 0.36, p > 0.05; SMD −0.48, 95% CI −1.22 to 0.27, p > 0.05), respectively.
<RES> In participants with non-headache conditions, psychological therapies improved pain post-treatment (p < 0.01) with a small effect size (SMD −0.37, 95% CI −0.59 to −0.15), disability post-treatment (p < 0.01) with a moderate effect size (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.20), and disability at follow-up (p < 0.05) with a small effect size (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.28 to −0.01).
<RES> However, the follow-up analysis included only two studies and should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> A small effect was found for depression and anxiety post-treatment (SMD −0.19, 95% CI −0.35 to −0.04, p < 0.05; SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.49 to −0.06, p < 0.01), respectively.
<RES> No clear evidence of benefit was found for other follow-up analyses.
<RES> Analyses of adverse effects were not possible.
<RES> No data were presented on satisfaction/acceptability.
<RES> Only one study could be included in an analysis of the effect of psychological therapies on quality of life in participants with headache conditions; hence, no analysis could be undertaken.
<RES> Three studies presented quality of life data for participants with non-headache conditions; however, no clear evidence of benefit was found (SMD −0.27, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.01, p > 0.05).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions regarding the efficacy of psychological therapies delivered via the Internet in participants with headache conditions.
<CON> Psychological therapies reduced pain and disability post-treatment; however, no clear evidence of benefit was found for depression and anxiety.
<CON> For participants with non-headache conditions, psychological therapies delivered via the Internet reduced pain, disability, depression, and anxiety post-treatment.
<CON> The positive effects on disability were maintained at follow-up.
<CON> These effects are promising, but considerable uncertainty remains around the estimates of effect.
<CON> These results come from a small number of trials, with mostly wait-list controls, no reports of adverse events, and non-clinical recruitment methods.
<CON> Due to the novel method of delivery, the satisfaction and acceptability of these therapies should be explored in this population.
<CON> These results are similar to those of reviews of traditional face-to-face therapies for chronic pain.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Before people undergo surgery, they must be examined so the practitioner can confirm that they are fit enough to tolerate the procedure.
<ABS> These changes offer many potential benefits, but it is important to examine their impact on outcomes such as cancellation of surgery and perioperative complications.
<ABS> In February 2013, we searched medical databases to look for controlled trials of participants who had undergone surgery and had been randomly assigned to nurse- or doctor-led preoperative assessment (POA).
<ABS> We found two trials, one randomized and one quasi-randomized.
<ABS> Both studies were conducted in the UK and compared POA performed by the nurse with POA performed by the non-specialist doctor.
<ABS> One studied 1874 adult participants who were undergoing elective surgery, and the other studied 595 children who were undergoing day surgery.
<ABS> Neither study reported on cancellations of surgery, gain in participant information or knowledge or perioperative complications.
<ABS> Reported outcomes focused on the accuracy of the assessment.
<ABS> As there is currently no evidence from trials concerning the impact of nurse-led POA on patient outcomes, we are unable to make any recommendations for practice on the basis of this review.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> These changes offer many potential benefits for patients, but it is important to demonstrate that standards of patient care are maintained as nurses take on these responsibilities.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We planned to investigate whether there are differences in quality and outcome depending on the age of the participant, the training of staff or the type of surgery or anaesthesia provided.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two eligible studies, both comparing nurse-led POA with POA led by non-specialist doctors, with a total of 2469 participants.
<RES> One study was randomized and the other quasi-randomized.
<RES> Blinding of staff and participants to allocation was not possible.
<RES> In both studies, all participants were additionally assessed by a specialist doctor (anaesthetist in training), who acted as the reference standard.
<RES> In neither study did participants proceed from assessment by nurse or junior doctor to surgery.
<RES> Neither study reported on cancellations of surgery, gain in participant information or knowledge or perioperative complications.
<RES> Reported outcomes focused on the accuracy of the assessment.
<RES> One study undertook qualitative assessment of participant satisfaction with the two forms of POA in a small number of non-randomly selected participants (42 participant interviews),
<RES> and both groups of participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the care received.
<RES> This study also examined economic modelling of costs of the POA as performed by the nurse and by the non-specialist doctor based on the completeness of the assessment as noted in the study and found no difference in cost.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, no evidence is available from RCTs to allow assessment of whether nurse-led POA leads to an increase or a decrease in cancellations or perioperative complications or in knowledge or satisfaction among surgical participants.
<CON> One study, which was set in the UK, reported equivalent costs from economic models.
<CON> Nurse-led POA is now widespread, and it is not clear whether future RCTs of this POA strategy are feasible.
<CON> A diagnostic test accuracy review may provide useful information.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Primary liver cancer and liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma are the two most common malignant tumours to affect the liver.
<ABS> The liver is second only to the lymph nodes as the most common site for metastatic disease.
<ABS> More than half of patients with metastatic liver disease will die from metastatic complications.
<ABS> Microwave coagulation involves placing an electrode into a lesion under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance.
<ABS> The microwave coagulator generates and transmits microwave energy to the electrode.
<ABS> Coagulative necrosis causes cellular death and destroys tissue in the treatment area, resulting in reduction of tumour size.
<ABS> One randomised clinical trial comparing microwave coagulation with conventional surgery (liver resection) is included in the review: 14 participants received microwave coagulation and 16 participants underwent conventional surgery.
<ABS> The trial was judged to have a high risk of systematic error (ie, overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).
<ABS> On the basis of one randomised trial, which did not describe allocation concealment or blinding, and which excluded from analysis 25% of participants after random assignment, evidence is insufficient to show whether microwave coagulation provides any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with conventional surgery for participants with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
<ABS> The number of adverse events, except for the requirement for blood transfusion, which was more common in the liver resection group, was similar in both groups.
<ABS> At present, microwave therapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We extracted relevant information on participant characteristics, interventions, and study outcomes and data on outcome measures for our review, as well as information on design and methodology of the studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One randomised clinical trial fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the review.
<RES> Forty participants with multiple liver metastases of colorectal cancer and no evidence of extrahepatic disease were randomly assigned.
<RES> Thirty of these participants (14 females and 16 males) were included in the analysis: 14 participants received microwave coagulation and 16 underwent conventional surgery (hepatectomy or liver resection).
<RES> The diagnosis of colorectal cancer (Stage IB to IIIC; tumour (T)2 node (N)0 to T3N2) and liver metastases was confirmed by histological assessment.
<RES> Mean participant age was 61 years.
<RES> The tumours were resectable.
<RES> The risk of bias in the trial was judged to be high.
<RES> Participants were followed for three years.
<RES> Mortality at the last follow-up was 64% (9/14) in the microwave group and 75% (12/16) in the conventional surgery group (risk ratio (RR) 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 1.39), that is, no significant difference was observed.
<RES> In the microwave coagulation group, 71%, 57%, and 14% survived 1, 2, and 3 years, and in the conventional surgery group, the percentages were 69%, 56%, and 23%.
<RES> The hazard ratio calculated using the Parmar method was 0.91 (0.39 to 2.15).
<RES> Mean survival time was 27 months in the microwave group and 25 months in the conventional surgery group, and the mean disease-free interval was 11.3 months in the microwave group and 13.3 months in the hepatectomy group.
<RES> Differences for both outcomes were not statistically significant.
<RES> Reported frequency of adverse events was similar between the microwave coagulation and conventional surgery groups, except for the required blood transfusion, which was more common in the conventional surgery group.
<RES> No intervention-related mortality was observed.
<RES> After treatment, the carcinoembryonic antigen level decreased significantly in both groups.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The number of adverse events, except for the requirement for blood transfusion, which was more common in the liver resection group, was similar in both groups.
<CON> At present, microwave therapy cannot be recommended outside randomised clinical trials.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cancer of the mouth is a serious condition and only half of those that develop the disease manage to survive after five years.
<ABS> It is commonly preceded by visible lesions, which if identified early, can be treated and could result in simpler surgery and much better outcomes.
<ABS> As a result, there is a need to understand how good different types of tests are at the early detection of oral cancer and the lesions that precede it.
<ABS> The most common method is an oral visual inspection by a clinician, but other tests include the use of a blue 'dye', illumination with a special light and self examination by the individual.
<ABS> The review found a lot of variety in the ability of the different tests to differentiate between healthy mouths and non-referable lesions and more serious lesions or oral cancer.
<ABS> Overall, visual examination by a front-line health worker proved to be the best method.
<ABS> Between 59% and 99% of mouth cancers were detected, although sometimes normal tissue was mistaken for oral cancer.
<ABS> The remaining techniques examined were not as good at detecting mouth cancer and identified less than a third of cases.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to April 2013) and four other electronic databases (the Cochrane Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies Register, the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, EMBASE (OVID), and MEDION) from inception to April 2013.
<MaM> The electronic databases were searched on 30 April 2013.
<MaM> There were no restrictions on language in the searches of the electronic databases.
<MaM> We conducted citation searches, and screened reference lists of included studies for additional references.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Diagnosis of PMD or cancer was made by specialist clinicians or pathologists, or alternatively through follow-up.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance.
<MaM> Eligibility, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by at least two authors independently and in duplicate.
<MaM> Studies were assessed for methodological quality using QUADAS-2.
<MaM> We reported the sensitivity and specificity of the included studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Thirteen studies, recruiting 68,362 participants, were included.
<RES> These studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of COE (10 studies), MSE (two studies).
<RES> One randomised controlled of test accuracy trial directly evaluated COE and vital rinsing.
<RES> There were no eligible diagnostic accuracy studies evaluating light-based detection or blood or salivary sample analysis (which tests for the presence of bio-markers of PMD and oral cancer).
<RES> Given the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of the participants recruited, setting, prevalence of target condition, the application of the index test and reference standard and the flow and timing of the process, the data could not be pooled.
<RES> For COE (10 studies, 25,568 participants), prevalence in the diagnostic test accuracy sample ranged from 1% to 51%.
<RES> For the eight studies with prevalence of 10% or lower, the sensitivity estimates were highly variable, and ranged from 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.93) to 0.99 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00) with uniform specificity estimates around 0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.00).
<RES> Estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.83) for one study with prevalence of 22% and 0.97 (95% CI 0.96 to 0.98) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.77) for one study with prevalence of 51%.
<RES> Applicability was of low concern overall for two studies; high concern overall for three studies due to high risk population, and unclear overall applicability for five studies.
<RES> Estimates of sensitivity for MSE (two studies, 34,819 participants) were 0.18 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.24) and 0.33 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.65); specificity for MSE was 1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.00) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.69).
<RES> One study (7975 participants) directly compared COE with COE plus vital rinsing in a randomised controlled trial.
<RES> This study found a higher detection rate for oral cavity cancer in the conventional oral examination plus vital rinsing adjunct trial arm.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The prevalence of the target condition both between and within index tests varied considerably.
<CON> For COE estimates of sensitivity over the range of prevalence levels varied widely.
<CON> Observed estimates of specificity were more homogeneous.
<CON> General dental practitioners and dental care professionals should remain vigilant for signs of PMD and oral cancer whilst performing routine oral examinations in practice.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> We wanted to know whether twice-daily treatment with an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist was better than treatment with a dummy inhaler for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
<ABS> Background to the review
<ABS> COPD is a disease of the lungs that causes airways to narrow.
<ABS> As a result, people with COPD experience symptoms of breathlessness, cough and mucus buildup, which worsen over time.
<ABS> Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD, and it is the fourth or fifth most common cause of death worldwide.
<ABS> Inhaled salmeterol and formoterol, known as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), are widely used to manage the symptoms of COPD, so it is important to understand their benefits and side effects.
<ABS> They are often introduced when inhaled treatments for quick relief from symptoms (e.g. salbutamol) are no longer helpful.
<ABS> LABAs are designed to be taken twice a day to control symptoms and reduce the likelihood of flare-ups.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> Twenty-six studies (including 14,939 people with moderate to severe symptoms of COPD) compared twice-daily salmeterol or formoterol with a dummy inhaler.
<ABS> The evidence gathered for this review is current up to June 2013.
<ABS> Results within studies were described most often after six months of treatment, but some were reported at three months and others after as long as three years.
<ABS> More men than women took part, and they had moderate to severe symptoms when they began treatment.
<ABS> People who took LABA inhalers showed greater improvement on quality of life scales than those taking dummy inhalers, and they had fewer serious flare-ups that resulted in a hospital stay (18 fewer per 1000).
<ABS> They also had better lung function than people who had taken placebo.
<ABS> LABA inhalers did not reduce the number of people who died, and no significant difference was noted in the number who had serious adverse events while taking the medication.
<ABS> These studies were most often sponsored by drug companies and were generally well designed.
<ABS> People in the studies did not know which treatment they were getting, and neither did the people doing the research.
<ABS> Several studies did not describe flare-ups, hospital stays or lung volume, so there is a chance that evidence obtained in future studies would change the strength of what has been concluded.
<ABS> Additionally, quite a lot of variation was noted between studies in the effects of LABA inhalers on quality of life, serious side effects and lung function.
<ABS> This may be explained in part by variation in study methods regarding what medications people could continue to take.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a respiratory disease that causes progressive symptoms of breathlessness, cough and mucus build-up.
<INT> It is the fourth or fifth most common cause of death worldwide and is associated with significant healthcare costs.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting populations of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data and characteristics were extracted independently by two review authors, and each study was assessed for potential sources of bias.
<MaM> Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the proportion of participants taking inhaled corticosteroids and for studies with high or uneven rates of attrition.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-six RCTs met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 14,939 people with COPD to receive twice-daily LABA or placebo.
<RES> Study duration ranged from three months to three years; the median duration was six months.
<RES> Participants were more often male with moderate to severe symptoms at randomisation; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was between 33% and 55% predicted normal in the studies, and mean St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score (SGRQ) ranged from 44 to 55 when reported.
<RES> Moderate-quality evidence showed that LABA treatment improved quality of life on the SGRQ (mean difference (MD) -2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.09 to -1.54; I2 = 50%; 17 trials including 11,397 people) and reduced the number of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation (odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.95; I2 = 10%; seven trials including 3804 people).
<RES> In absolute terms, 18 fewer people per 1000 were hospitalised as the result of an exacerbation while receiving LABA therapy over a weighted mean of 7 months (95% CI 3 to 31 fewer).
<RES> Scores were also improved on the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ), and more people receiving LABA treatment showed clinically important improvement of at least four points on the SGRQ.
<RES> The number of people who had exacerbations requiring a course of oral steroids or antibiotics was also lower among those taking LABA (52 fewer per 1000 treated over 8 months; 95% CI 24 to 78 fewer, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Mortality was low, and combined findings of all studies showed that LABA therapy did not significantly affect mortality (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.08; I2 = 21%; 23 trials including 14,079 people, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> LABA therapy did not affect the rate of serious adverse events (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.14; I2 = 34%, moderate quality evidence), although there was significant unexplained heterogeneity, especially between the two formoterol doses.
<RES> LABA therapy improved predose FEV1 by 73 mL more than placebo (95% CI 48 to 98; I2 = 71%, low quality evidence), and people were more likely to withdraw from placebo than from LABA therapy (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; I2 = 0%).
<RES> Higher rates of withdrawal in the placebo arm may reduce our confidence in some results, but the disparity is more likely to reduce the magnitude of difference between LABA and placebo than inflate the true effect; removing studies at highest risk of bias on the basis of high and unbalanced attrition did not change conclusions for the primary outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Moderate-quality evidence from 26 studies showed that inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists are effective over the medium and long term for patients with moderate to severe COPD.
<CON> Their use is associated with improved quality of life and reduced exacerbations, including those requiring hospitalisation.
<CON> Overall, findings showed that inhaled LABAs did not significantly reduce mortality or serious adverse events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Abdominal aortic aneurysms are a ballooning of the largest blood vessel in the abdomen, the abdominal aorta, due to weakness of the vessel wall.
<ABS> This ballooning may lead to life threatening rupture.
<ABS> Repair of the aneurysm is recommended if it is felt to pose a significant risk.
<ABS> All repairs involve putting in an artifical graft, a tube composed of fabric, to help reinforce the artery wall.
<ABS> There are two main methods for repair.
<ABS> One is an open technique in which the whole abdomen is opened and the graft is put inside the blood vessel.
<ABS> The other technique is an endovascular aneurysm repair.
<ABS> With this technique the graft is fed into the abdominal aorta through an artery in the groin (the femoral artery) and it avoids the large abdominal incision.
<ABS> This review looked at an alternative method for introducing the graft into the femoral artery, percutaneous access.
<ABS> Instead of making an incision in the groin to expose the femoral artery (a cut-down), a small hole is made in the skin and then a needle with a plastic tube sitting over it is introduced into the femoral artery.
<ABS> Once introduced, the needle can be pulled back up the tube leaving the tube in place in the artery.
<ABS> The graft and all other materials can then be fed into the artery via the plastic tube.
<ABS> Once the procedure is complete the tube can be withdrawn.
<ABS> The surface incision can usually be closed with one stitch.
<ABS> This review found only one study which compared the cut-down technique of endovascular repair with the percutaneous technique.
<ABS> The study had 30 participants; 15 underwent the cut-down technique and 15 the percutaneous technique.
<ABS> No one died during the study and the procedure was successful in all participants.
<ABS> However, for one participant the surgery had to be changed from percutaneous access to the cut-down technique, and one participant undergoing the percutaneous surgery had to have the artery repaired surgically due to continued bleeding.
<ABS> The surgery took less time in the percutaneous group compared with the cut-down group (87 minutes versus 108 minutes).
<ABS> There were no other significant differences found in the study.
<ABS> The included study did not report on the methods of randomisation, how the randomisation was concealed and the pre-selected outcomes of interest.
<ABS> This one study did not provide enough data and no firm conclusions could be drawn from it.
<ABS> Larger studies are needed to provide us with more data.
<ABS> The review indicates that the new technique might be a good option for some patients but more research is needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a vascular condition with significant risk attached, particularly if they rupture.
<INT> It is, therefore, critical to identify and repair these as an elective procedure before they rupture and require emergency surgery.
<INT> Repair has traditionally been an open surgical technique that required a large incision across the abdomen.
<INT> More recently endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVARs) have become a common alternative.
<INT> In this procedure, the common femoral artery is exposed via a cut-down approach and a graft is introduced to the aneurysm in this way.
<INT> This review examines a totally percutaneous approach to EVAR.
<INT> This technique gives a minimally invasive approach to femoral artery access that may reduce groin wound complication rates and improve recovery time.
<INT> The technique may, however, be less applicable in patients with, for example, groin scarring or arterial calcification.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Only randomised controlled trials were considered.
<MaM> The primary intervention was a totally percutaneous endovascular repair.
<MaM> All device types were considered.
<MaM> This was compared against standard femoral artery endovascular repair.
<MaM> Only studies investigating elective repairs were considered.
<MaM> Studies reporting emergency surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) and those reporting aorto-uni-iliac repairs were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All data were collected independently by two review authors.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 30 participants, 15 undergoing the percutaneous technique and 15 treated by the standard femoral cut-down approach.
<RES> There were no significant differences between the two groups at baseline.
<RES> No mortality or failure of aneurysm exclusion was observed in either group.
<RES> Three wound infections occurred in the standard femoral cut-down group, whereas none were observed in the percutaneous group.
<RES> This was not statistically significant.
<RES> Only one major complication was observed in the study, a conversion to the cut-down technique in the percutaneous access group.
<RES> No long-term outcomes were reported.
<RES> One episode of a bleeding complication was reported in the percutaneous group.
<RES> Significant differences were detected in surgery time (percutaneous 86.7 ± 27 minutes versus conventional 107.8 ± 38.5 minutes; P < 0.05).
<RES> The included study had a small sample size and failed to report adequately the method of randomisation, allocation concealment and the pre-selected outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Only one small study was identified, which did not provide adequate evidence to determine the efficacy and safety of the percutaneous approach compared with endovascular aneurysm repairs.
<CON> This review has identified a clear need for further research into this potentially beneficial technique.
<CON> One ongoing study was identified in the search, which may provide an improved evidence base in the future.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Stem cell transplantation
<ABS> Stem cell transplantation is an important treatment option for individuals with blood cancers (haematological malignancies).
<ABS> During the procedure, blood-forming (stem) cells, derived from the bone marrow, peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood of a healthy donor, are transplanted into a person with a blood cancer.
<ABS> The aim is to replenish the recipient's body with healthy cells after treatment with conditioning regimens such as chemotherapy or radiation (or both).
<ABS> Peripheral blood stem cells and bone marrow stem cells are the standard stem cell sources used in adults.
<ABS> The most successful transplantations occur when stem cells are transplanted from a healthy donor whose tissue is genetically compatible with that of the recipient (matched related donor).
<ABS> If no matched donor can be identified, it is possible to transplant cells from a matched unrelated donor or from donors carrying certain mismatches.
<ABS> In principle, the higher the degree of genetic mismatch, the higher the risk of severe transplant-related complications, especially graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in which a donor's white blood cells (T cells) attack the recipient's healthy tissues.
<ABS> Peripheral blood versus bone marrow stem cells
<ABS> Peripheral blood stem cells are collected after the donor has received a drug that acts to mobilise stem cells from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood.
<ABS> Bone marrow stem cell donation involves the removal of stem cells from the pelvic bone of the donor under general anaesthesia.
<ABS> Donor convenience as well as logistic reasons favour peripheral blood stem cell donation.
<ABS> This review addresses the question of which stem cell source - bone marrow or peripheral blood - is the most suitable for individuals undergoing stem cell transplantation.
<ABS> Clinical results from several studies have been published comparing the use of bone marrow stem cells and peripheral blood stem cells in individuals with haematological malignancies.
<ABS> In most of these studies, the rates at which stem cells received during transplantation start to grow and make new blood cells (known as engraftment) have been shown to be faster following the transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCT) than following transplantation of bone marrow stem cells (BMT) platelets.
<ABS> Some studies have reported PBSCT to be associated with a higher risk of developing GvHD than BMT.
<ABS> GvHD is associated with a lower risk of relapse, reflecting the capability of the immune response to simultaneously attack the malignant cells (Graft versus Malignacy effect).
<ABS> On the other hand, GvHD can be an important driver of transplant-related mortality and morbidity.
<ABS> Disease-free and overall survival have usually been reported not to differ between PBSCT and BMT.
<ABS> A systematic review from 2005, based on data from individual recipients, could not identify a preferred stem cell source and was largely based on data from the late 1990s.
<ABS> Since then, transplant indications and strategies, as well as supportive care measures, have changed substantially.
<ABS> Results of this meta-analysis
<ABS> In this systemic review we included nine randomised controlled trials involving 1521 participants.
<ABS> Key inclusion criteria were adults undergoing stem cell transplantation for a blood cancer using either bone marrow stem cells or peripheral stem cells as a stem cell source.
<ABS> Participants were treated between 1994 and 2009.
<ABS> The evidence is current to February 2014.
<ABS> In summary, we found overall and disease-free survival to be comparable for both PBSCT and BMT.
<ABS> Recipients of bone marrow stem cells from related donors were more likely to relapse than recipients of peripheral blood stem cells from related donors, but this difference was not seen in the recipients of bone marrow stem cells from unrelated donors.
<ABS> The incidence of acute GvHD following PBSCT and BMT was comparable; however, there was a tendency to more severe GvHD with PBSCT.
<ABS> PBSCT was associated with higher rates of chronic GvHD.
<ABS> The time to engraftment was significantly shorter with PBSCT than with BMT.
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was considered moderate to high.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Against the background of altering clinical strategies these results confirm that the current practice of using peripheral blood rather than bone marrow as a source of stem cells for stem cell transplantation in adults with haematological malignancies is not deleterious with respect to overall survival.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an established treatment option for many malignant and non-malignant disorders.
<INT> In the past two decades, peripheral blood stem cells replaced bone marrow as stem cell source due to faster engraftment and practicability.
<INT> Previous meta-analyses analysed patients treated from 1990 to 2002 and demonstrated no impact of the stem cell source on overall survival, but a greater risk for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in peripheral blood transplants.
<INT> As transplant indications and conditioning regimens continue to change, whether the choice of the stem cell source has an impact on transplant outcomes remains to be determined.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2014), trial registries and conference proceedings.
<MaM> The search was conducted in October 2011 and was last updated in February 2014.
<MaM> We did not apply any language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors screened abstracts and extracted and analysed data independently.
<MaM> We contacted study authors for additional information.
<MaM> We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included nine RCTs that met the pre-defined selection criteria, involving a total of 1521 participants.
<RES> Quality of data reporting was heterogeneous among the studies.
<RES> Overall, the risk of bias in the included studies was low.
<RES> For the primary outcome overall survival, our analysis demonstrated comparable results between bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) (six studies, 1330 participants; hazard ratio (HR) 1.07; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25; P value = 0.43; high-quality evidence).
<RES> Disease-free survival (six studies, 1225 participants; HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.6; moderate-quality of evidence) and non-relapse or transplant-related mortality (three studies, 758 participants; HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.28; P = 0.91; high-quality evidence) were also comparable between transplantation arms.
<RES> In the related-donor setting, data from two of eight studies with 211 participants (21%) indicated a higher relapse incidence in participants transplanted with bone marrow stem cells rather than peripheral blood stem cells (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.47 to 5.08; P value = 0.001).
<RES> There was no clear evidence of a difference in relapse incidence between transplantation groups in unrelated donors (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47; P value = 0.66).
<RES> The difference between the donor-related and -unrelated subgroups (P-value = 0.008) was considered to be statistically significant.
<RES> BMT was associated with lower rates of overall and extensive chronic GvHD than PBSCT (overall chronic GvHD: four studies, 1121 participants; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; P value = 0.0001, extensive chronic GvHD: four studies, 765 participants; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.9; P value = 0.006; moderate-quality evidence for both outcomes).
<RES> The incidence of acute GvHD grades II to IV was not lower (six studies, 1330 participants; HR 1.03; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; P value = 0.67; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a trend for a lower incidence of grades III and IV acute GvHD with BMT than with PBSCT (three studies, 925 participants; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.02; P value = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence).
<RES> Times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were longer with BMT than with PBSCT (neutrophil: five studies, 662 participants; HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.64 to 2.35; P value < 0.00001; platelet: four studies, 333 participants; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.78; P value < 0.00001).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review  found high-quality evidence that overall survival following allo-HSCT using the current clinical standard stem cell source - peripheral blood stem cells - was similar to that following allo-HSCT using bone marrow stem cells in adults with haematological malignancies.
<CON> We found moderate-quality evidence that PBSCT was associated with faster engraftment of neutrophils and platelets, but a higher risk of GvHD (in terms of more overall and extensive chronic GvHD).
<CON> There was an imprecise effect on relapse and on severe (grades III to IV) acute GvHD.
<CON> Quality of life, which is severely affected by GvHD, was not evaluated.
<CON> Against the background of transplantation practices that have clearly changed over the past 10 to 15 years, our aim was to provide current data on the best stem cell source for allo-HSCT, by including the results of recently conducted trials.
<CON> Our review includes participants recruited up to 2009, a proportion of whom were older, had received reduced-intensity conditioning regimens or had been transplanted with stem cells from unrelated donors.
<CON> However, only one, large, study included relatively recently treated participants.
<CON> Nevertheless, our findings are comparable to those of previous meta-analyses suggesting that our results hold true for today's practice.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Question: What are the most effective ways to improve and sustain exercise behaviour in cancer survivors, that is, people living with and beyond cancer?
<ABS> Background: Being regularly active for people living with and beyond cancer can have a wide range of beneficial effects.
<ABS> These range from improving quality of life to improving physical function.
<ABS> It might also reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and of dying from cancer.
<ABS> We know that most people living with and beyond cancer are not regularly physically active.
<ABS> So, we need to understand how to get those individuals who are not currently exercising to begin to be active and how to help them maintain this change in behaviour.
<ABS> Study characteristics: We included only studies that compared an exercise intervention with a usual care comparison.
<ABS> Only studies including sedentary people over the age of 18 with the same cancer diagnosis were eligible.
<ABS> Participants must have been put in a group at random.
<ABS> We searched for evidence from research databases up to August 2012.
<ABS> Key results: This review included 14 trials involving 648 participants.
<ABS> Furthermore, how trial investigators report what their exercise programme involved and how much of it the participants actually did is not good.
<ABS> However, we did find some evidence that setting exercise goals, prompting people to exercise, getting people to monitor their own behaviour and getting people to think about how to do exercise outside of a supervised environment could be helpful.
<ABS> In addition, we found some evidence suggesting that study participants are better able to tolerate the exertion of undertaking exercise for up to six months.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: The main problems that we found regarding the quality of studies in this review included not knowing how study investigators conducted randomisation for the trials, and whether investigators who were doing trial assessments knew to which group the person they were assessing had been randomly assigned.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> However, how to promote exercise behaviour in sedentary cancer cohorts is not as well understood.
<INT> A large majority of people living with or recovering from cancer do not meet exercise recommendations.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> What adverse effects are attributed to different exercise interventions?
<OBJ> Which interventions are most effective in improving exercise behaviour amongst patients with different cancers?
<OBJ> Which interventions are most likely to promote long-term (12 months or longer) exercise behaviour?
<OBJ> What frequency of contact with exercise professionals is associated with increased exercise behaviour?
<OBJ> What behaviour change techniques are most often associated with increased exercise behaviour?

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 8, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycLIT/PsycINFO, SportDiscus and PEDro from inception to August 2012.
<MaM> We also searched the grey literature, wrote to leading experts in the field, wrote to charities and searched reference lists of other recent systematic reviews.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors working independently (LB and KH) screened all titles and abstracts to identify studies that might meet the inclusion criteria, or that cannot be safely excluded without assessment of the full text (e.g. when no abstract is available).
<MaM> All eligible papers were formally abstracted by at least two members of the review author team working independently (LB and KH) and using the data collection form.
<MaM> When possible, and if appropriate, we performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis of study outcomes.
<MaM> For continuous outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness), we extracted the final value, the standard deviation of the outcome of interest and the number of participants assessed at follow-up in each treatment arm, to estimate standardised mean difference (SMD) between treatment arms.
<MaM> SMD was used, as investigators used heterogeneous methods to assess individual outcomes.
<MaM> If a meta-analysis was not possible or was not appropriate, we synthesised studies as a narrative.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen trials were included in this review, involving a total of 648 participants.
<RES> Only studies involving breast, prostate or colorectal cancer were identified as eligible.
<RES> Just six trials incorporated a target level of exercise that could meet current recommendations.
<RES> Only three trials were identified that attempted to objectively validate independent exercise behaviour with accelerometers or heart rate monitoring.
<RES> Adherence to exercise interventions, which is crucial for understanding treatment dose, is often poorly reported.
<RES> It is important to note that the fundamental metrics of exercise behaviour (i.e. frequency, intensity and duration, repetitions, sets and intensity of resistance training), although easy to devise and report, are seldom included in published clinical trials.
<RES> None of the included trials reported that 75% or greater adherence (the stated primary outcome for this review) of the intervention group met current aerobic exercise recommendations at any given follow-up.
<RES> Just two trials reported six weeks of resistance exercise behaviour that would meet the guideline recommendations.
<RES> However, three trials reported adherence of 75% or greater to an aerobic exercise goal that was less than the current guideline recommendation of 150 minutes per week.
<RES> All three incorporated both supervised and independent exercise components as part of the intervention, and none placed restrictions on the control group in terms of exercise behaviour.
<RES> These three trials shared programme set goals and the following behaviour change techniques: generalisation of a target behaviour; prompting of self-monitoring of behaviour; and prompting of practise.
<RES> Despite the uncertainty surrounding adherence in many of the included trials, interventions caused improvements in aerobic exercise tolerance at 8 to 12 weeks (from 7 studies, SMD 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.95) in intervention participants compared with controls.
<RES> At six months, aerobic exercise tolerance was also improved (from 5 studies, SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94), but it should be noted that four of the five trials used in this analysis had a high risk of bias, hence caution is warranted in interpretation of results.
<RES> Attrition over the course of these interventions is typically low (median 6%).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Interventions to promote exercise in cancer survivors who report better levels of adherence share some common behaviour change techniques.
<CON> These involve setting programme goals, prompting practise and self-monitoring and encouraging participants to attempt to generalise behaviours learned in supervised exercise environments to other, non-supervised contexts.
<CON> However, expecting most sedentary survivors to achieve current guideline recommendations of at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise is likely to be unrealistic.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> The Lund concept for severe traumatic brain injury

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> The Lund concept in the treatment of brain injuries

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Brain injuries are a significant cause of death and permanent disability.
<ABS> It is recognised that the magnitude of the injury is not defined at the moment of the injury, but rather develops in the hours and days that follow.
<ABS> The Lund concept differs from conventional treatment strategies in emphasising the pressures inside small blood vessels in the brain.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched the medical literature in order to find randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (studies where people are randomly assigned to a treatment or non-treatment group) that compared the Lund concept versus other treatments.
<ABS> We included people with severe traumatic brain injury, irrespective of their gender, age or race.
<ABS> The latest search was 5 November 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no studies comparing the Lund concept versus other treatments.
<ABS> There is no evidence from RCTs that the Lund concept is a preferable treatment for brain injury and further research is needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Severe traumatic brain injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
<INT> Treatment strategies in management of such injuries are directed to the prevention of secondary brain ischaemia, as a consequence of disturbed post-traumatic cerebral blood flow.
<INT> They are usually concerned with avoiding high intracranial pressure (ICP) or adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
<INT> An alternative to this conventional treatment is the Lund concept, which emphasises a reduction in microvascular pressures.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the reference lists of relevant studies and published reviews found with our search.
<MaM> The most recent search was 5 November 2013.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Children with heart defects since birth (that is, congenital heart disease) frequently undergo a particular type of invasive procedure termed cardiac catheterization, to help diagnose or correct their condition.
<ABS> This procedure consists of inserting a flexible plastic tube (catheter) into the blood vessels of the patient and guiding it to his or her heart, where a dye is injected before pictures of the heart are taken.
<ABS> Children undergoing this type of procedure may suffer unwanted complications in the arteries into which the catheter is inserted.
<ABS> It is estimated that approximately 1 out of 5 to 10 patients develop arterial blood clots (that is, thrombosis) and thus require additional treatment to prevent those clots from growing further.
<ABS> Heparin, a medication known as a 'blood thinner' (that is, an anticoagulant drug), employed in clinical practice since 1935, has been used to decrease the number of arterial blood clots during heart catheterization.
<ABS> However, the best dose of heparin to be used in children during heart catheterization remains to be determined.
<ABS> This review included two small randomized controlled trials with a total of 492 participants.
<ABS> These two studies found only imprecise evidence that the risk of arterial clots was similar in both the low-dose and high-dose heparin groups.
<ABS> Only one study reported bleeding complications and the frequency of clots in veins, which were also not significantly different between groups.
<ABS> Side effects of heparin other than bleeding complications were not reported in either of the studies.
<ABS> However, because the two included studies were small and because of concerns about the quality of one of them due to the lack of information provided, their results are insufficient to determine the effects of different heparin doses.
<ABS> Further larger studies are required to answer this question.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In 1974, unfractionated heparin proved to be superior to placebo in decreasing the incidence of arterial thrombosis in pediatric patients.
<INT> However, the optimal dose of unfractionated heparin to be utilized in this setting remains a matter of controversy.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched November 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 10).
<MaM> The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Virtual Health Library.
<MaM> Clinical trials databases and sources of grey literature were searched.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We selected studies conducted in children aged 0 to 18 years.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The first screening of potentially eligible studies was conducted by one of the authors (MLA).
<MaM> The second screening, quality assessment and data extraction were independently conducted by two authors (MLA, LRB).
<MaM> Outcomes (thrombotic events, bleeding complications, other complications) were treated as dichotomous variables.
<MaM> The effect measures used were risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and number needed to treat (NNT), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies with a total of 492 participants were eligible for inclusion.
<RES> Risk of bias was low for all domains in one of the studies and unclear for the other.
<RES> One of the trials was stopped early.
<RES> The quality of evidence for our key outcomes was moderate.
<RES> The CI for the risk of arterial thrombotic events was compatible with benefits of either high or low unfractionated heparin dose regimens (RR low-dose versus high-dose 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92).
<RES> Only one of the studies reported the frequency of bleeding events for the cohort of patients and found no statistically significant difference in the incidence of major and minor bleeding events between arms (RR low-dose versus high-dose 1.38, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.13 for minor bleeding; RR low-dose versus high-dose 2.96, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.34 for major bleeding events).
<RES> This study also reported on the incidence of deep vein thrombosis when comparing the high versus low dose of heparin and reported a non-significant difference (RR low-dose versus high-dose 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.28).
<RES> The other study lacked information about bleeding.
<RES> Side effects of heparin other than bleeding complications were not reported in either of the studies.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> A further adequately powered, randomized clinical trial is needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Newborn infants commonly develop a condition called jaundice.
<ABS> Jaundice occurs as the result of accumulation of a yellowish-orange pigment called bilirubin in the skin and eyes.
<ABS> Bilirubin in increased concentrations can be damaging to the brain and can have profound long-term detrimental effects.
<ABS> Phototherapy is a form of treatment used in newborns to reduce levels of bilirubin.
<ABS> "Home-based phototherapy" can be used in the home setting with appropriate supervision.
<ABS> Home phototherapy is used only in cases of uncomplicated newborn jaundice.
<ABS> Home-based phototherapy can offer certain advantages such as reduced hospital costs and improved bonding between an infant and mother.
<ABS> On the other hand, home-based phototherapy could be associated with problems such as increased risk of the damaging effects of bilirubin on the brain and increased risk of readmission to hospital.
<ABS> In this Cochrane review, home-based phototherapy was compared with hospital-based phototherapy for uncomplicated jaundice in full-term newborns.
<ABS> The review authors found no studies that met the eligibility criteria.
<ABS> The authors of this Cochrane review conclude that no high-quality evidence is currently available to support or refute the use of home phototherapy for uncomplicated newborn jaundice.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Phototherapy is commonly used for the treatment of neonatal jaundice, and home-based phototherapy is now being used in certain centres.
<INT> Potential problems include increased duration of phototherapy, increased readmission to hospital and increased risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We planned to include specific subgroups for duration in hospital, method of phototherapy and criteria for readiness for discharge.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) January 2013, Issue 1, part of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1966 to 15 February 2013), CINAHL (from 1982 to 15 February 2013) and EMBASE (from 1988 to 15 February 2013).
<MaM> We searched for abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies' Annual Meetings 2000 to 2013.
<MaM> We searched for ongoing trials on the following websites: ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) and Current Controlled Trials (http://controlled-trials.com/).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually.
<ABS> It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke.
<ABS> The advent of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis.
<ABS> More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified.
<ABS> These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or no classic symptoms such as coughing (including coughing up blood), chest or upper back pain, acute shortness of breath, or general or specific failure of the circulation that is either cardiac or peripheral in nature.
<ABS> However, in patients with an impaired cardiac and pulmonary condition the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs.
<ABS> Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine computed tomography (CT) for cancer staging in oncologic patients).
<ABS> Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared with those with proximal PEs.
<ABS> However, the clinical significance and prognosis in these patients has to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.
<ABS> No studies met the inclusion criteria of the review.
<ABS> There is no randomised controlled trial evidence for the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulation therapy versus no intervention in patients with isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) or incidental SSPE and, therefore, we can not draw any conclusions.
<ABS> Well-conducted research is required before informed practice decisions can be made.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of death, accounting for 50,000 to 200,000 deaths annually.
<INT> It is the third most common cause of mortality among the cardiovascular diseases, after coronary artery disease and stroke.
<INT> The advent of multi-detector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has allowed better assessment of PE regarding visualisation of the peripheral pulmonary arteries, increasing its rate of diagnosis.
<INT> More cases of peripheral PEs, such as isolated subsegmental PE (SSPE) and incidental PE, have thereby been identified.
<INT> These two conditions are usually found in patients with few or none of the classic PE symptoms such as haemoptysis or pleuritic pain, acute dyspnoea or circulatory collapse.
<INT> However, in patients with reduced cardio-pulmonary (C/P) reserve the classic PE symptoms can be found with isolated SSPEs.
<INT> Incidental SSPE is found casually in asymptomatic patients, usually by diagnostic imaging performed for other reasons (for example routine CT for cancer staging in oncologic patients).
<INT> Traditionally, all PEs are anticoagulated in a similar manner independent of the location, number and size of the thrombi.
<INT> It has been suggested that many patients with SSPE may be treated without benefit, increasing adverse events by possible unnecessary use of anticoagulants.
<INT> Patients with isolated SSPE or incidental PE may have a more benign clinical presentation compared with those with proximal PEs.
<INT> However, the clinical significance in patients and their prognosis have to be studied to evaluate whether anticoagulation therapy is required.

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Trifluoperazine (trade name Stelazine) is a long-established antipsychotic drug that has been used since the 1950s to treat schizophrenia.
<ABS> It is one of the first generation (typical) drugs that have proven very effective for treating the ‘positive symptoms’ of schizophrenia, such as hearing voices, seeing things and having strange beliefs.
<ABS> These drugs may cause side effects such as involuntary shaking, restlessness and movement disorders such as having a strange posture.
<ABS> There are also more modern drugs (second generation and atypical antipsychotic drugs).
<ABS> These are effective with the ‘positive symptoms’ of mental illness but also help treat ‘negative symptoms’ such as apathy, weight gain and loss of emotion in people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> These more modern drugs are much more expensive.
<ABS> This review is based on a search for trials carried out in July 2012, and includes 10 studies with 686 participants.
<ABS> The aim was to determine the effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia when compared with placebo (a ‘dummy’ treatment).
<ABS> As expected, people given trifluoperazine showed a significant improvement compared to placebo in both the short and medium term, reinforcing the use of this well-established typical antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> However, trifluoperazine can cause side effects such as confusion, agitation, having a dry mouth and blurred vision, but causes less sedation and dizzy spells, so is generally well tolerated by people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> The authors of the review conclude that trifluoperazine has similar effectiveness to other common antipsychotic drugs, although it may cause more side effects.
<ABS> Evidence used in the review was also graded as low or very low quality.
<ABS> In the light of this, use of other antipsychotic drugs should be considered before starting on trifluoperazine.
<ABS> Most of the included studies were conducted roughly 40 years ago so new, large, comprehensive and independent research trials are needed.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer Ben Gray from RETHINK.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine absolute effects of trifluoperazine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses compared with placebo.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Studies for the effects of interventions were reliably selected by a review team and data were doubly independently extracted to reduce bias.
<MaM> We only used dichotomous data, using intention-to-treat analysis when possible.
<MaM> Data were estimated using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> A 'Summary of findings' table was produced, where possible, for each primary outcome using GRADE.
<MaM> Economic studies were searched and reliably selected by review authors (VF and SS) to provide an economic summary of available data.
<MaM> Where no relevant economic studies were eligible for inclusion, the economic review team valued the already-included effectiveness outcome data to provide a rudimentary economic summary.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> This review included 10 studies with a total number of 686 participants featuring in 20 different outcomes of interest.
<RES> Overall, there was significant clinical improvement in clinical global state at medium term amongst people receiving trifluoperazine (3 RCTs, n = 417, RR 4.61, CI 1.54 to 13.84, low quality evidence) and significantly fewer people receiving trifluoperazine left the studies early due to relapse or worsening at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 381, RR 0.34, CI 0.23 to 0.49, low quality evidence).
<RES> However, results were equivocal for leaving the study early at medium term for any reason (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 0.80, CI 0.17 to 3.81, very low quality evidence) and due to severe adverse effects (2 RCTs, n = 391, RR 1.54, CI 0.56 to 4.24, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Equivocal data were also found for intensified symptoms at medium term (2 RCTs, n = 80, RR 1.05, CI 0.54 to 2.05, very low quality evidence) and rates of agitation or distress again at medium term (1 RCT, n = 52, RR 2.00, CI 0.19 to 20.72, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Comparison between low and high-dose trifluoperazine with placebo from a single study provided equivocal evidence of effects.
<RES> For economic outcomes, we valued outcomes in GBP terms and presented them in additional tables; there was an estimated saving of £3488.3 in favour of trifluoperazine.
<RES> However, numerous assumptions were made and these savings need to be interpreted in light of those assumptions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Our results agree with existing evidence that compared to placebo, trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia.
<CON> Furthermore, our review provides supportive evidence that trifluoperazine increases the risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects.
<CON> Although the effect sizes against placebo are similar to those observed with other agents, they are based on data from many small, pre-CONSORT trials with generally either a low or very low GRADE evidence that has limited implication for clinical practice.
<CON> Large, independent trials are needed that adhere to the CONSORT statement to compare trifluoperazine with placebo used in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like illnesses.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Seizures are typically short events with changes in awareness, changes in feelings or sensations, and strange body movements.
<ABS> Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures.
<ABS> More than half of the people with epilepsy have seizures which can be controlled with medication.
<ABS> For those with epileptic seizures that do not respond to medication, surgery can treat the seizures in many, but not all, individuals.
<ABS> New tools are being investigated to more accurately find the area in the brain which produces the seizures, to help remove the area of the brain causing the seizures.
<ABS> Recordings of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) (these are signals in the brain that oscillate faster than the typical signals that are recorded) may be one such tool.
<ABS> Our literature searches, carried out on 15 April 2013, found that so far 11 participants have been enrolled in two small prospective studies that used recordings of abnormal HFOs to help delineate the epileptogenic zone and guide resective surgery.
<ABS> No reliable conclusions can be drawn from the limited evidence that exists at present.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures.
<INT> Approximately two-thirds of seizures can be controlled with antiepileptic medications (Kwan 2000).
<INT> For some of the others, surgery can completely eliminate or significantly reduce the occurrence of disabling seizures.
<INT> Recordings of pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) may be one such tool.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The primary outcome of the review was the Engel Class Outcome System.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes were responder rate, International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) epilepsy surgery outcome, frequency of adverse events from any source and quality of life outcomes.
<MaM> We intended to analyse outcomes via an aggregated data fixed-effect model meta-analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> Both studies were small non-randomised trials, with no control group and no blinding.
<RES> The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low.
<RES> The combination of these two studies resulted in 11 participants who prospectively used ictal HFOs for epilepsy surgery decision making.
<RES> Results of the postsurgical seizure freedom Engel class I to IV outcome were determined over a period of 12 to 38 months (average 23.4 months) and indicated that six participants had an Engel class I outcome (seizure freedom), two had class II (rare disabling seizures), three had class III (worthwhile improvement).
<RES> No adverse effects were reported.
<RES> Neither study compared surgical results guided by HFOs versus surgical results guided without HFOs.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Breast cancer treatment can cause infertility.
<ABS> Freezing egg cells (oocytes) or embryos before treatment can increase the chances of future motherhood.
<ABS> Hormonal treatment is required before freezing of oocytes or embryos.
<ABS> In cases of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, this hormonal treatment can theoretically be harmful.
<ABS> Therefore, these women may receive tamoxifen or letrozole in addition to standard hormonal treatment.
<ABS> Cochrane review authors examined the evidence about tamoxifen or letrozole versus standard methods for women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer undergoing freezing of oocytes or embryos in assisted reproduction.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> No randomised studies were found in which the different types of treatment available for these women were compared.
<ABS> The evidence is current to October 2013.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid PsycINFO, and EBSCOhost CINAHL.
<MaM> We applied no limitations in year of publication or language.
<MaM> In addition, we searched trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, conference abstracts, and sources of grey literature.
<MaM> The search was conducted in January 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently scanned the titles, abstracts, or both sections according to Cochrane guidelines.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No randomised controlled trials support the idea that these alternative COS schedules are superior to standard COS.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system.
<ABS> Preliminary data show that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), an immunosuppressive agent, might be beneficial for MS patients.
<ABS> The results showed no evidence favoring MMF in reducing relapses or preventing disability progression after a 12-month follow-up period.
<ABS> No data were available at 24 months.
<ABS> All patients receiving MMF suffered from gastrointestinal upset, and one had a transient diarrhea, but no serious adverse effects were reported.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system and a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (January 14, 2013).
<MaM> We searched three Chinese databases (January 2013) and checked reference lists of identified trials.
<MaM> We contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to ask for additional information.
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One included study involving 26 participants with new-onset RRMS investigated the efficacy and safety of MMF (13 participants) versus placebo in interferon β-1a–treated participants.
<RES> It was assessed to be at high risk of bias, and had a small numbers of participants receiving treatment with short-term duration.
<RES> There was inadequate information provided by the study to determine the effect of MMF in reducing relapses, preventing disability progression, or developing new T2- or new gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a 12-month follow-up period.
<RES> No data were available at 24 months.
<RES> No serious adverse effects were reported.
<RES> All participants in the MMF-treated group suffered from gastrointestinal upset, but none of them discontinued therapy as a result.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Resection versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen which secretes digestive juices for the digestion of food.
<ABS> It also harbours the insulin secreting cells which maintain the blood sugar levels.
<ABS> Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer.
<ABS> Surgery to remove the cancer improves survival.
<ABS> However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving major blood vessels which are not usually removed because of the fear of increased complications after surgery.
<ABS> Such patients receive palliative treatment.
<ABS> Resection (removing part of an organ) of the pancreas has been suggested as an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
<ABS> However, in this group of patients the benefits and harms of surgical resection versus other treatments are not clear.
<ABS> We set out to answer this question by performing a thorough search of the literature for studies which compared surgical removal with palliative treatments.
<ABS> We included only randomised controlled trials, studies which, if designed appropriately, can help avoid arriving at wrong conclusions.
<ABS> We searched the literature for all studies reported until December 2013.
<ABS> Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and independently extracted data to minimise errors.
<ABS> Characteristics of studies
<ABS> We identified two trials comparing surgical removal of the pancreas versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
<ABS> Ninety eight patients were included in these two trials.
<ABS> Forty seven patients received surgery while the remaining patients received palliative treatment.
<ABS> The choice of who received surgery and who received other treatments was decided by a method similar to the toss of a fair coin.
<ABS> Main results
<ABS> Approximately 97% of patients who underwent cancer removal surgery survived the surgery in the two trials.
<ABS> The patients who received surgery were twice as likely to live as those who received other treatments.
<ABS> The survivors were followed until at least five years.
<ABS> There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group while approximately 40% of the patients who underwent surgical removal were alive at the end of three years.
<ABS> This difference in survival was statistically significant.
<ABS> The studies did not report the complications related to surgery although it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from complications in both groups.
<ABS> None of the trials reported quality of life.
<ABS> There was no evidence of any difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of a patient related to the treatment) between the two groups.
<ABS> The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the surgical removal group (by about USD 10,000) than in the palliative treatment group in the trial conducted in Japan.
<ABS> There was no information about the costs in the other trial, which was conducted in Greece.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Overall, the trials were at high risk of bias (that is, there is a potential to arrive at wrong conclusions).
<ABS> This was because it was not clear how the randomisation was performed, whether the people assessing the outcomes were aware of the group to which the participants belonged, and whether all participants were included in the analysis.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low as the trials were at high risk of bias and there were few trials to assess whether only studies with negative results were published.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> There is very low quality evidence that surgical resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with involvement of veins.
<ABS> In selected patients pancreatic resection could be considered for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased complications associated with the surgical procedure and when sufficient expertise is available.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to obtain more precise results and to assess the quality of life of patients and the value for money of surgical removal versus other treatments for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer.
<INT> Resection of the cancer is the only treatment with the potential to achieve long-term survival.
<INT> However, a third of patients with pancreatic cancer have locally advanced cancer involving adjacent structures such as blood vessels which are not usually removed because of fear of increased complications after surgery.
<INT> Such patients often receive palliative treatment.
<INT> Resection of the pancreas along with the involved vessels is an alternative to palliative treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and independently extracted the data.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and random-effects models using Review Manager (RevMan).
<MaM> We calculated the hazard ratio (HR), risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on an intention-to-treat analysis.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified two trials comparing pancreatic resection versus other treatments for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
<RES> Ninety eight patients were randomised to pancreatic resection (n = 47) or palliative treatment (n = 51) in the two trials included in this review.
<RES> Both trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> Both trials included patients who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer which involved the serosa anteriorly or retroperitoneum posteriorly or involved the blood vessels.
<RES> Such pancreatic cancers would be considered generally unresectable.
<RES> One trial included patients with pancreatic cancer in different locations of the pancreas including the head, neck and body (n = 42).
<RES> The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent partial pancreatic resection (pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node clearance or distal pancreatic resection with lymph node clearance) in this trial; the control group received palliative treatment with chemoradiotherapy.
<RES> In the other trial, only patients with cancer in the head or neck of the pancreas were included (n = 56).
<RES> The patients allocated to the pancreatic resection group underwent en bloc total pancreatectomy with splenectomy and vascular reconstruction in this trial; the control group underwent palliative bypass surgery with chemoimmunotherapy.
<RES> The pancreatic resection group had lower mortality than the palliative treatment group (HR 0.38; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.58, very low quality evidence).
<RES> Both trials followed the survivors up to at least five years.
<RES> There were no survivors at two years in the palliative treatment group in either trial.
<RES> Approximately 40% of the patients who underwent pancreatic resection were alive in the pancreatic resection group at the end of three years.
<RES> This difference in survival was statistically significant (RR 22.68; 95% CI 3.15 to 163.22).
<RES> The difference persisted at five years of follow-up (RR 8.65; 95% CI 1.12 to 66.89).
<RES> Neither trial reported severe adverse events but it is likely that a significant proportion of patients suffered from severe adverse events in both groups.
<RES> The overall peri-operative mortality in the resection group in the two trials was 2.5%.
<RES> None of the trials reported quality of life.
<RES> The estimated difference in the length of total hospital stay (which included all admissions of the patient related to the treatment) between the two groups was imprecise (MD -23.00 days; 95% CI -59.05 to 13.05, very low quality evidence).
<RES> The total treatment costs were significantly lower in the pancreatic resection group than the palliative treatment group (MD -10.70 thousand USD; 95% CI -14.11 to -7.29, very low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is very low quality evidence that pancreatic resection increases survival and decreases costs compared to palliative treatments for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and venous involvement.
<CON> When sufficient expertise is available, pancreatic resection could be considered for selected patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who are willing to accept the potentially increased morbidity associated with the procedure.
<CON> Further randomised controlled trials are necessary to increase confidence in the estimate of effect and to assess the quality of life of patients and the cost-effectiveness of pancreatic resection versus palliative treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Historically, corticosteroids have been the backbone of immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and corticosteroids are typically started immediately before or during transplantation.
<ABS> However, the use of corticosteroids is associated with several complications such as infection, hepatitis C virus recurrence, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, fracture, and reduced quality of life.
<ABS> Hence, corticosteroid avoidance and corticosteroid reduction regimens for liver transplant recipients have been developed.
<ABS> Antibodies against T-cells are also used to induce immunosuppression after liver transplantation.
<ABS> This T-cell specific antibody induction therapy is intended to reduce rejection of the transplanted liver and is given within the first two weeks after transplantation.
<ABS> Furthermore, these antibodies may allow for delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors to protect kidney function.
<ABS> Different types of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy have been used for liver transplant recipients: interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (BT563, daclizumab, or basiliximab), monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 receptor (muromonab-CD3) or the CD52 surface protein (alemtuzumab), and polyclonal antibodies (rabbit or horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)).
<ABS> A novel approach has been to replace corticosteroids with T-cell specific antibody induction as part of a corticosteroid reduction or avoidance regimen.
<ABS> The benefits and harms of this T-cell specific antibody induction therapy remain unclear.
<ABS> Aim
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether antibody induction therapy was better or worse than therapy with corticosteroids for induction of immunosuppression after liver transplantation.
<ABS> In specific, we wanted to establish the role of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy as part of corticosteroid-free immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and to find out which type of T-cell specific antibody induction therapy works best with the fewest adverse effects.
<ABS> We systematically searched medical databases (date of last search September 2013) and found 10 randomised clinical trials with 1589 liver transplant recipients, which investigated the use of antibodies compared with corticosteroids for induction in 1589 participants after they had undergone liver transplant.
<ABS> These trials studied antithymocyte globulin and the interleukin-2 receptor antagonists basiliximab and daclizumab.
<ABS> All of these trials had high risk of bias (i.e., risks of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms), which means that the quality of the evidence included in the review is low.
<ABS> Results
<ABS> Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding mortality, graft loss, acute rejection, infection, hepatitis C virus recurrence, malignancy, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.
<ABS> Cytomegalovirus infection was less frequent in patients receiving any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence).
<ABS> This finding was also observed when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence) and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence).
<ABS> However, when trial sequential analysis regarding cytomegalovirus infection was applied, random errors could not be excluded.
<ABS> Furthermore, diabetes mellitus occurred less frequently when T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence), when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence), and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (low-quality evidence).
<ABS> When trial sequential analysis was applied, we could exclude random errors regarding a reduction in diabetes mellitus by T-cell specific antibodies compared with corticosteroids.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> As a result of the low quality of the current evidence, the effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain.
<ABS> T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce diabetes mellitus and may reduce cytomegalovirus infection when compared with corticosteroid induction.
<ABS> No other clear benefits or harms were associated with the use of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction.
<ABS> For some analyses, the number of trials investigating the use of T-cell specific antibody induction after liver transplantation is small, and the numbers of participants and outcomes in these randomised trials are limited.
<ABS> Hence, additional high-quality randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction for liver transplant recipients.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Liver transplantation is an established treatment option for end-stage liver failure.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all randomised clinical trials assessing immunosuppression with T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction in liver transplant recipients.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used RevMan for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) and of continuous data with mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> We assessed risk of systematic errors (bias) using bias risk domains with definitions.
<MaM> We used trial sequential analysis to control for random errors (play of chance).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 10 randomised trials with a total of 1589 liver transplant recipients, which studied the use of T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction.
<RES> All trials were with high risk of bias.
<RES> We compared any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction in 10 trials with 1589 participants, including interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction versus corticosteroid induction in nine trials with 1470 participants, and polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction versus corticosteroid induction in one trial with 119 participants.
<RES> Our analyses showed no significant differences regarding mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.43), graft loss (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.53) and acute rejection (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.00), infection (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09), hepatitis C virus recurrence (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00), malignancy (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.73), and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.38) when any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (all low-quality evidence).
<RES> Cytomegalovirus infection was less frequent in patients receiving any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.75; low-quality evidence).
<RES> This was also observed when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83; low-quality evidence), and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.70; low-quality evidence).
<RES> However, when trial sequential analysis regarding cytomegalovirus infection was applied, the required information size was not reached.
<RES> Furthermore, diabetes mellitus occurred less frequently when T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60; low-quality evidence), when interleukin-2 receptor antagonist induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.61; low-quality evidence), and when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with corticosteroid induction (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.95; low-quality evidence).
<RES> When trial sequential analysis was applied, the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit was crossed.
<RES> We found no subgroup differences for type of interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (basiliximab versus daclizumab).
<RES> Four trials reported on adverse events.
<RES> However, no differences between trial groups were noted.
<RES> Limited data were available for meta-analysis on drug-specific adverse events such as haematological adverse events for antithymocyte globulin.
<RES> No data were available on quality of life.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Because of the low quality of the evidence, the effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain.
<CON> T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce diabetes mellitus and may reduce cytomegalovirus infection when compared with corticosteroid induction.
<CON> No other clear benefits or harms were associated with the use of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction.
<CON> For some analyses, the number of trials investigating the use of T-cell specific antibody induction after liver transplantation is small, and the numbers of participants and outcomes in these randomised trials are limited.
<CON> Hence, additional randomised clinical trials are needed to assess the benefits and harms of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with corticosteroid induction for liver transplant recipients.
<CON> Such trials ought to be conducted with low risks of systematic error and of random error.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Antibodies against T-cells are used to induce immunosuppression after liver transplantation.
<ABS> These antibodies are intended to reduce rejection of the transplanted liver and are given within the first two weeks after transplantation.
<ABS> Furthermore, these antibodies may allow for delayed introduction of calcineurin inhibitors to protect kidney function.
<ABS> Different types of antibodies have been used: interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (BT563, daclizumab, or basiliximab), monoclonal antibodies specific for the CD3 receptor (muromonab-CD3) or the CD52 surface protein (alemtuzumab), or polyclonal antibodies of horse or rabbit (antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)).
<ABS> The benefits and harms of these antibodies are unclear.
<ABS> This systematic review aimed to evaluate the use of antibodies against T-cells after liver transplantation.
<ABS> The question is whether T-cell antibody induction has a role after liver transplantation, and which antibody works best with the least number of adverse events.
<ABS> Aim
<ABS> We wanted to discover whether antibody induction therapy was better or worse than therapy without T-cell specific antibodies for induction of immunosuppression after liver transplantation, and whether one type of antibody is better than another type of antibody.
<ABS> We systematically searched medical databases and found 19 randomised clinical trials including 25 comparisons that investigated the use of different types of T-cell specific antibodies in 2067 patients after they had received their liver transplant.
<ABS> All of these trials had high risk of bias (that is, risk of overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).
<ABS> Results
<ABS> From our results we were unable to determine the effects of antibody induction on mortality, graft loss including death, adverse events, infection, CMV infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension for any of the comparisons.
<ABS> Acute rejection may be reduced when any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction and when trial sequential analysis, which we used to control for random errors, was applied.
<ABS> Furthermore, serum creatinine was statistically significantly higher in the T-cell specific antibody induction group compared with the no induction group, as well as in the polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction group compared with the no induction group.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> The effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain because of high risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials, the small number of randomised clinical trials reported, and the limited numbers of participants and outcomes in the trials.
<ABS> T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce acute rejection when compared with no induction.
<ABS> Such trials ought to be conducted with low risk of systematic error (bias) and low risk of random error (play of chance).

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Liver transplantation is an established treatment option for end-stage liver failure.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised clinical trials assessing immunosuppression with T-cell specific antibody induction compared with placebo, no induction, or another type of antibody induction in liver transplant recipients.
<MaM> Our inclusion criteria stated that participants within each included trial should have received the same maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.
<MaM> We planned to include trials with all of the different types of T-cell specific antibodies that are or have been used for induction (ie., polyclonal antibodies (rabbit of horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG), or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)), monoclonal antibodies (muromonab-CD3, anti-CD2, or alemtuzumab), and interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (daclizumab, basiliximab, BT563, or Lo-Tact-1)).

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used RevMan analysis for statistical analysis of dichotomous data with risk ratio (RR) and of continuous data with mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
<MaM> We assessed the risk of systematic errors (bias) using bias risk domains with definitions.
<MaM> We used trial sequential analysis to control for random errors (play of chance).
<MaM> We presented outcome results in a summary of findings table.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Of the 19 trials, 16 trials were two-arm trials, and three trials were three-arm trials.
<RES> Thus, we were able to compare T-cell specific antibody induction versus no induction (17 trials with a total of 1955 participants).
<RES> Overall, no difference in mortality (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.28; low-quality of evidence), graft loss including death (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.19; low-quality of evidence), and adverse events ((RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; low-quality evidence) outcomes was observed between any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction compared with no induction when the T-cell specific antibody induction agents were analysed together or separately.
<RES> Acute rejection seemed to be reduced when any kind of T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence), and when trial sequential analysis was applied, the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit was crossed before the required information size was obtained.
<RES> Furthermore, serum creatinine was statistically significantly higher when T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction (MD 3.77 μmol/L, 95% CI 0.33 to 7.21; low-quality evidence), as well as when polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction was compared with no induction, but this small difference was not clinically significant.
<RES> We found no statistically significant differences for any of the remaining predefined outcomes — infection, cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension — when the T-cell specific antibody induction agents were analysed together or separately.
<RES> Limited data were available for meta-analysis on drug-specific adverse events such as haematological adverse events for antithymocyte globulin.
<RES> No data were found on quality of life.
<RES> When T-cell specific antibody induction agents were compared with another type of antibody induction, no statistically significant differences were found for mortality, graft loss, and acute rejection for the separate analyses.
<RES> When interleukin-2 receptor antagonists were compared with polyclonal T-cell specific antibody induction, drug-related adverse events were less common among participants treated with interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.63; low-quality evidence), but this was caused by the results from one trial, and trial sequential analysis could not exclude random errors.
<RES> We found no statistically significant differences for any of the remaining predefined outcomes: infection, cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis C recurrence, malignancy, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, renal failure requiring dialysis, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
<RES> No data were found on quality of life.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The effects of T-cell antibody induction remain uncertain because of the high risk of bias of the randomised clinical trials, the small number of randomised clinical trials reported, and the limited numbers of participants and outcomes in the trials.
<CON> T-cell specific antibody induction seems to reduce acute rejection when compared with no induction.
<CON> Such trials ought to be conducted with low risks of systematic error (bias) and low risk of random error (play of chance).

<H1> Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Fentanyl patches placed on the skin produced good pain relief for most people with moderate or severe cancer pain.
<ABS> One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity.
<ABS> The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses.
<ABS> Morphine taken by mouth has been used since the 1950s for controlling cancer pain.
<ABS> Since that time a number of different drugs with morphine-like actions have been produced for treating cancer pain, one of which is fentanyl.
<ABS> Fentanyl is particularly useful because it can be absorbed through the skin from patches.
<ABS> The ability of any drug to achieve consistent drug levels in the blood and the brain could, in theory, lead to better control of cancer pain.
<ABS> It also relieves the need to take medicines several times a day, as patches can often last for several days before changing.
<ABS> We found nine studies involving 1244 patients.
<ABS> The studies were often small, used different study designs, and compared fentanyl with many different drugs.
<ABS> Most patients had pain that went from moderate or severe before transdermal fentanyl to no worse than mild pain when using transdermal fentanyl.
<ABS> Only 3 in 10 patients were constipated using transdermal fentanyl compared with 5 in 10 using oral morphine.
<ABS> We could not analyse the data in a meaningful way regarding harmful (adverse) events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion.
<ABS> These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease processes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Opioid drugs have been used for many years to relieve pain.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies with fewer than 10 participants were excluded.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were extracted independently by two review authors.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria, including a Turkish study that is awaiting formal translation.
<RES> There were 1244 participants randomised in classically designed RCTs, of whom 1197 had evaluable data, and 138 patients enrolled in an enriched enrolment, randomised withdrawal (EERW) trial.
<RES> Overall, 600 participants were treated with transdermal fentanyl patches, 382 with various formulations of morphine, 36 with methadone, and 221 with paracetamol plus codeine.
<RES> There were major sources of potential bias, including lack of blinding, small size, high levels of attrition, and inconsistent reporting.
<RES> We could not compare data in a meaningful analysis regarding adverse events such as nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, and confusion.
<RES> These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease process.
<RES> There were insufficient comparable data for meta-analysis to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat (NNT) for the analgesic effect.
<RES> In seven studies with 461 participants reporting pain intensity results after about two weeks, the mean or median pain scores were on the borderline of mild and moderate pain.
<RES> Most participants would have had no worse than mild pain on treatment.
<RES> Another reported that 77% of participants using transdermal fentanyl had an undefined successful outcome.
<RES> Fewer participants experienced constipation with transdermal fentanyl (28%) than with oral morphine (46%), giving a risk ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78); the NNT to prevent constipation was 5.5 (95% CI 3.8 to 10).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The randomised trial literature for effectiveness of transdermal fentanyl is limited, but it is an important medicine.
<CON> Most studies recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide data appropriate for meta-analysis.
<CON> The evidence pointed to a useful and significant reduction in complaints about constipation for transdermal fentanyl compared with oral morphine.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Recent studies suggest a connection between a virus (human papillomavirus) and throat cancer (oropharyngeal cancer) in some patients.
<ABS> This review has been conducted to assess potential new treatments that have emerged as a result of this information.
<ABS> When diagnosed, throat cancers can be at an advanced stage and radiotherapy (which uses beams of radiation to kill cancer cells) or chemotherapy (drugs which kill cancer cells) are the most frequently used treatments.
<ABS> Both have side effects and may result in a decreased ability to talk, eat or drink.
<ABS> Newer therapies (biological) are now emerging that will help the immune system to fight cancer.
<ABS> So far, high-quality evidence to assess these new treatment protocols is lacking, but may be available after 2014 as several ongoing studies are completed.
<ABS> Important outcomes to measure will be the likelihood of survival from the various treatments, as well as side effects and quality of life in the longer term.
<ABS> This review will be updated to include this new evidence as it becomes available.
<ABS> This review is currently up to date to June 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas are a distinct subgroup of tumours that may have a better prognosis than traditional tobacco/alcohol-related disease.
<INT> Iatrogenic complications, associated with conventional practice, are estimated to cause mortality of approximately 2% and high morbidity.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the most recent search was 25 June 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials investigating de-escalation treatment protocols for human papillomavirus-associated, locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma.
<MaM> Specific de-escalation categories were: 1) bioradiotherapy (experimental) versus chemoradiotherapy (control); 2) radiotherapy (experimental) versus chemoradiotherapy (control); and 3) low-dose (experimental) versus standard-dose radiotherapy (control).
<MaM> The outcomes of interest were overall and disease-specific survival, treatment-related morbidity, quality of life and cost.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Three authors independently selected studies from the search results and extracted data.
<MaM> We planned to use the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess study quality.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We did not identify any completed randomised controlled trials that could be included in the current version of this systematic review.
<RES> We did, however, identify seven ongoing trials that will meet our inclusion criteria.
<RES> These studies will report from 2014 onwards.
<RES> We excluded 30 studies on methodological grounds (seven randomised trials with post hoc analysis by human papillomavirus status, 11 prospective trials and 12 ongoing studies).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is currently insufficient high-quality evidence for, or against, de-escalation of treatment for human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma.
<CON> Future trials should be multicentre to ensure adequate power.
<CON> Adverse events, morbidity associated with treatment, quality of life outcomes and cost analyses should be reported in a standard format to facilitate comparison with other studies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Cystic fibrosis is a genetically inherited disease which is not uncommon in the Western World.
<ABS> Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by extreme sensitivity to aspergillus (a fungus) and may occur in 2% to 15% of patients with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> Corticosteroids and antifungal therapy are the mainstay of treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but prolonged or repeated use of corticosteroids may lead to serious side-effects.
<ABS> Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs as a result of the action of IgE antibodies (a type of protein).
<ABS> A drug that acts against these IgE antibodies (anti-IgE therapy), such as omalizumab, may be a possible treatment for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
<ABS> The drug is given as an injection below the skin every two to four weeks.
<ABS> The review aimed to show whether anti-IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis is effective and highlight any possible adverse effects.
<ABS> We could only include one small study in the review (14 patients) and that was stopped early because, despite all reasonable attempts, the investigators could not recruit patients into the study.
<ABS> There was little information available from the included study, except for some adverse effect data.
<ABS> Therefore, there is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis and large, prospective, randomized controlled trials of this treatment are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births.
<INT> Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis.
<INT> The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole.
<INT> The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects.
<INT> The monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics.
<INT> The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks.
<INT> Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti-IgE antibodies.
<INT> Therefore, anti-IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.
<MaM> Last search: 21 January 2013.
<MaM> We searched the ongoing trial registry clinicaltrials.gov for any ongoing trials.
<MaM> Latest search for clinicaltrials.gov: 22 February 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study.
<MaM> They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager 5.1.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one trial enrolling 14 patients was eligible for inclusion in the review.
<RES> The study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available.
<RES> One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) patients in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> This may cause anxiety among the patients and its cost effectiveness is questionable.
<ABS> Clinician and patient groups have asked for a consideration of alternative model approaches; since most recurrences are symptomatic, follow-up of patients after treatment for gynaecological cancer may be accomplished by patient-related outcome measures (PROMs) rather than routine follow-up visits.
<ABS> PROMs is an umbrella term that covers a range of potential types of measurements, but is used specifically to refer to self reports by the patient of their health and well-being.
<ABS> Use of PROMs as alternatives to follow-up may have immense psychological benefits for the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system.
<ABS> There is currently no evidence to determine whether PROMs are better or worse in helping women to live longer and better after gynaecological cancer rather than follow-up visits.
<ABS> It is also unclear whether PROMs are  beneficial in terms of patient satisfaction or quality of life.
<ABS> Study Characteristics
<ABS> We performed an extensive literature search to identify randomised controlled studies that compared PROMs to routine follow up.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> No studies suitable for inclusion in our review were found.
<ABS> Evidence from adequately-powered studies at low risk of bias are needed.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Use of QoL and cancer-specific questionnaires as alternatives to follow-up may have immense psychological benefit to the patient and cost benefit to the healthcare system.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to November 2012.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of review articles.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies that involved women completing PROMs at intervals and submitting results for assessment by their cancer care team or structured interviews of women during their follow-up were included in the analysis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> We found no studies and therefore analysed no data.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence to make an informed decision about PROMs for follow-up after gynaecological cancer.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Antiretroviral combination therapy (cART) has been shown to be effective in slowing down the progression of AIDS and in reducing HIV-related illnesses and death.
<ABS> In infants and children who are diagnosed with HIV infection and are below two years of age the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that cART should be started immediately.
<ABS> In children aged 2 to 5 years the WHO 2010 recommendations stated that treatment should be started when the body’s defence system has started to weaken (as indicated by a decline in a child’s CD4 cell count) or complications have occurred.
<ABS> This systematic review was undertaken to help inform the 2013 WHO guidelines which aimed to revise the recommendations of when to start therapy in 2 to 5 years old children.
<ABS> The authors identified two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared immediate with deferred initiation of cART in HIV-positive children aged 1 to 12 years in Thailand or Cambodia.
<ABS> Additional analyses of 122 children enrolled in the two studies at ages 2 to 5 years were made available for this review.
<ABS> A cohort study from South Africa in HIV-positive children (median age 3.5 years) starting tuberculosis treatment and ART was also included.
<ABS> Results showed that we still lack enough evidence to determine whether early or late initiation of cART is best in children aged 2 to 5 years.
<ABS> The authors recognized the lack of evidence but highlighted the potential value of simplifying WHO recommendations to start cART in all children below five years with the goal of providing programmatic advantage to treatment programmes in resource-limited settings.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) comprising three antiretroviral medications from at least two classes of drugs is the current standard treatment for HIV infection in adults and children.
<INT> Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for antiretroviral therapy recommend early treatment regardless of immunologic thresholds or the clinical condition for all infants (less than one years of age) and children under the age of two years.
<INT> For children aged two to five years current WHO guidelines recommend (based on low quality evidence) that clinical and immunological thresholds be used to identify those who need to start cART (advanced clinical stage or CD4 counts ≤ 750 cells/mm3 or per cent CD4 ≤ 25%).
<INT> This Cochrane review will inform the current available evidence regarding the optimal time for treatment initiation in children aged two to five years with the goal of informing the revision of WHO 2013 recommendations on when to initiate cART in children.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The date of the most recent search was 30 September 2012.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors considered studies for inclusion in the review, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data on the primary outcome of death from all causes and several secondary outcomes, including incidence of CDC category C and B clinical events and per cent CD4 cells (CD4%) at study end.
<MaM> For RCTs we calculated relative risks (RR) or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
<MaM> For cohort data, we extracted relative risks with 95% CI from adjusted analyses.
<MaM> We combined results from RCTs using a random effects model and examined statistical heterogeneity.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two RCTs in HIV-positive children aged 1 to 12 years were identified.
<RES> One trial was the pilot study for the larger second trial and both compared initiation of cART regardless of clinical-immunological conditions with deferred initiation until per cent CD4 dropped to <15%.
<RES> The two trials were conducted in Thailand, and Thailand and Cambodia, respectively.
<RES> Unpublished analyses of the 122 children enrolled at ages 2 to 5 years were included in this review.
<RES> There was one death in the immediate cART group and no deaths in the deferred group (RR 2.9; 95% CI 0.12 to 68.9).
<RES> In the subgroup analysis of children aged 24 to 59 months, there was one CDC C event in each group (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.06 to 14.87) and 8 and 11 CDC B events in the immediate and deferred groups respectively (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.24 to 3.73).
<RES> In this subgroup, the mean difference in CD4 per cent at study end was 5.9% (95% CI 2.7 to 9.1).
<RES> One cohort study from South Africa, which compared the effect of delaying cART for up to 60 days in 573 HIV-positive children starting tuberculosis treatment (median age 3.5 years), was also included.
<RES> The adjusted hazard ratios for the effect on mortality of delaying ART for more than 60 days was 1.32 (95% CI 0.55 to 3.16).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Prostaglandins for management of retained placenta

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Prostaglandins for management of retained placenta

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Medical research evidence is sparse and insufficient to support the routine use of the prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.
<ABS> Retained placenta affects 0.5% to 3% of women following delivery and is a major cause of maternal death caused by postpartum haemorrhage.
<ABS> A retained placenta is usually managed by manual removal or curettage under anaesthesia (which is not always immediately available).
<ABS> Surgical procedures themselves can be associated with haemorrhage and also infection and uterine perforation.
<ABS> Prostaglandins or their analogues, administered by any route, could be an alternative treatment especially in developing countries.
<ABS> Such medical management may facilitate the delivery of the retained placenta and be a safer alternative to surgery.
<ABS> The review identified three randomised controlled studies (involving 244 women) that compared the use of prostaglandins with placebo.
<ABS> Currently there is limited, very low-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness and the safety using prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.
<ABS> Use of prostaglandins resulted in less need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage and need for blood transfusion but none of the differences reached statistical significance.
<ABS> Much larger, adequately powered studies are needed to confirm that these clinically important beneficial effects are not just chance findings.
<ABS> Similarly, no differences were detected between prostaglandins and placebo in mean blood loss or the mean time from injection to placental removal (minutes).
<ABS> The prostaglandin was administered by intravenous infusion (E2 analogue sulprostone) in one study including 50 women and was orally or sublingually administered (E1 analogue misoprostol) in the other two studies including 194 women.
<ABS> Shivering was more frequent in women receiving the prostaglandin but there were no clear differences in vomiting, headache, maternal pain or nausea compared with placebo.
<ABS> The trials were small and of poor methodological quality.
<ABS> The quality of evidence is very low due to study limitations, inconsistency and imprecise results (few women and outcome events with wide confidence intervals).
<ABS> Two studies were stopped early due to an apparent benefit.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Retained placenta affects 0.5% to 3% of women following delivery and it is a major cause of maternal death due to postpartum haemorrhage.
<INT> Medical management to facilitate the delivery of the retained placenta could be a safe alternative avoiding surgical intervention.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effectiveness and safety of prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also contacted authors of included studies and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality.
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted data.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.
<MaM> Any disagreements were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third review author when required.
<MaM> Authors of the included studies were contacted for additional information.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three trials, involving 244 women.
<RES> The studies were considered to be at high risk of bias.
<RES> The prostaglandins used were PG E2 analogue (sulprostone) in 50 participants and PG E1 analogue (misoprostol) in 194 participants at a dose of 250 mcg and 800 mcg respectively.
<RES> The prostaglandins compared with placebo, were not superior in reducing the rate of manual removal of placenta (average risk ratio (RR) 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.27), severe postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15), need for blood transfusion (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.43 to 1.22), mean blood loss (mean difference (MD) -205.26 mL; 95% CI -536.31 to 125.79, random-effects) and the mean time from injection to placental removal (MD -7.00 minutes; 95% CI -21.20 to 7.20).
<RES> Side-effects were no different between groups (vomiting, headache, pain and nausea between injection and discharge from the labour ward), with the exception of shivering, which was more frequent in women receiving prostaglandins (RR 10.00; 95% CI 1.40 to 71.49).
<RES> We did not obtain any data for the primary outcomes of maternal mortality and the need to add another therapeutic uterotonic.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently there is limited, very low-quality evidence relating to the effectiveness and the safety using prostaglandins for the management of retained placenta.
<CON> Use of prostaglandins resulted in less need for manual removal of placenta, severe postpartum haemorrhage and blood transfusion but none of the differences reached statistical significance.
<CON> Much larger, adequately powered studies are needed to confirm that these clinically important beneficial effects are not just chance findings.
<CON> Similarly, no differences were detected between prostaglandins and placebo in mean blood loss or the mean time from injection to placental removal (minutes) or side-effects (vomiting, headache, pain and nausea between injection and discharge from the labour ward) except for 'shivering' which was more frequent in women who received prostaglandin.
<CON> The included studies were of poor quality and there is little confidence in the effect estimates; the true effect is likely to be substantially different.
<CON> We can not make any recommendations about changes to clinical practice.
<CON> More high-quality research in this area is needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Patients requiring general anaesthesia need assistance with breathing during the operation.
<ABS> To provide this, the anaesthetist may insert a tube through the mouth or nose and down the trachea (windpipe) into the lungs.
<ABS> This is known as tracheal intubation, and usually the intubator uses a metal instrument called a laryngoscope to position the patient so s/he can see the vocal cords directly (direct laryngoscopy).
<ABS> This can be a difficult procedure in obese men and women for various reasons, including fatty tissue in the neck and throat.
<ABS> Guidelines suggest the use of flexible intubation scopes (FISs) for tracheal intubation in obese people.
<ABS> These scopes allow the intubator to see the airway via a camera, but no reviews have examined the use of an FIS in this situation.
<ABS> Intubation with an FIS is considered an advanced method, requiring training and experience; therefore it may be underused in clinical practice.
<ABS> We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of an FIS used for tracheal intubation in obese patients with direct laryngoscopy and other intubation methods that give the intubator an indirect view of the larynx.
<ABS> These other methods include videolaryngoscopes (VLSs)—metal laryngoscopes that contain a camera.
<ABS> We found three small studies, with a total of 131 patients, that compared an FIS with a VLS.
<ABS> The results for all patient safety outcomes were inconclusive, and no differences were noted between intubation with a flexible scope and intubation with a videolaryngoscope.
<ABS> We are unable to make any recommendations for practice based on this review.
<ABS> More research is needed to identify the technique for intubating obese people that would offer the best success rate with the fewest complications.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The prevalence of obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2) is increasing in both developed and developing countries, leading to a rise in the numbers of obese patients requiring general anaesthesia.
<INT> Obese patients are at increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and tracheal intubation can be more difficult.
<INT> Flexible intubation scopes (FISs) are recommended as an alternative method of intubation in these patients.
<INT> Intubation with an FIS is considered an advanced method, requiring training and experience; therefore it may be underused in clinical practice.
<INT> Patient outcomes following intubation with these scopes compared with other devices have not been systematically reviewed.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We wished to compare the safety and effectiveness of a flexible intubation scope (FIS) used for tracheal intubation in obese patients (BMI > 30 kg/m2) with other methods of intubation, including conventional direct laryngoscopy, non-standard laryngoscopy and the use of intubating supraglottic airway devices.
<OBJ> We aimed to compare the frequency of complications, as well as process indicators, such as time taken for intubation and the proportion of first attempts that were successful, between groups using the different methods of intubation.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three eligible studies were identified, all comparing the use of an FIS with a VLS.
<RES> All studies were small, with only 131 participants in total across all trials.
<RES> It was impossible for the intubators to be unaware of the device used, so all studies were at high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes related to intubation.
<RES> Because of substantial differences in design between the studies, we did not combine their results in meta-analyses.
<RES> The results for all outcomes were inconclusive, with no differences noted between FIS and VLS.
<RES> Two studies with experienced intubators reported first attempt success rates greater than 70% in both groups and less than 5% of participants requiring a change of intubation device.
<RES> No evidence was found of any difference in difficulty or time taken between FIS and VLS intubation.
<RES> No serious complications or airway trauma was reported, so we were unable to address these outcomes.
<RES> Bleeding was uncommon, occurring in less than 5% of participants, and we found no evidence that it was more likely in the FIS group.
<RES> One small study with a novice intubator reported no successful intubations using an FIS and compared with the use of an intubating SAD and stylet, as well as with a VLS.
<RES> With only five participants in each group, no conclusions can be drawn from these additional comparisons.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The evidence base is sparse, and the existing literature does not address the clinical questions of patient safety posed by this review.
<CON> We are therefore unable to draw any conclusions on safety or effectiveness.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Caesaren section (CS) has become the most common obstetric surgery, with one in three of pregnant women having a caesarean delivery.
<ABS> The use of urinary catheters (flexible elastic tube used to drain urine from the bladder) during and after CS is routinely used with caesarean delivery.
<ABS> Alleged benefits of using catheters include; maintains bladder drainage that may improve visualisation during surgery and minimise bladder injury, and less retention of urine after operation (inability to pass urine), but it could be associated with an increased incidence of urinary tract infection, urethral pain, voiding difficulties after removal of the catheter, delayed ambulation, and increased hospital stay.
<ABS> This review is based on five studies involving 1065 women undergoing CS.
<ABS> The studies were of moderate quality.
<ABS> The included studies did not use this review's criteria for diagnosis for UTI, so there are no data for this primary outcome.
<ABS> When considering UTI, as defined by the trial authors, there were no clear differences between groups.
<ABS> There were no data relating to bladder injury during the CS (the review's other primary outcome).
<ABS> Our analysis showed that the use of urinary catheter was associated with less retention of urine after CS.
<ABS> On the other hand, pain/discomfort due to catheterisation or at first voiding after CS, time to ambulate and hospital stay favoured non-use of urinary catheter.
<ABS> There was no difference in the incidence of uterine bleeding due to uterine atony (relaxation of the uterus) after the delivery.
<ABS> The limited evidence in this review is based five trials of moderate quality and results should be considered in this context.
<ABS> There is not enough evidence to assess the routine use of indwelling bladder catheters in women undergoing CS.
<ABS> There is a need for more rigorous research on this topic and future trials should use a standardised criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and other common outcomes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Bladder evacuation is carried out as a preoperative procedure prior to CS.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing indwelling bladder catheter versus no catheter or bladder drainage in women undergoing CS (planned or emergency), regardless of the type of anaesthesia used.
<MaM> Quasi-randomised trials, cluster-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion.
<MaM> Studies presented as abstracts were eligible for inclusion providing there was sufficient information to assess the study design and outcomes.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and trial quality, and extracted data.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search retrieved 16 studies (from 17 reports).
<RES> Ten studies were excluded and one study is awaiting assessment.
<RES> We included five studies involving 1065 women (1090 recruited).
<RES> The five included studies were at moderate risk of bias.
<RES> Data relating to one of our primary outcomes (UTI) was reported in four studies but did not meet our definition of UTI (as prespecified in our protocol).
<RES> The included studies did not report on our other primary outcome – intraoperative bladder injury (this outcome was not prespecified in our protocol).
<RES> Two secondary outcomes were not reported in the included studies: need for postoperative analgesia and women’s satisfaction.
<RES> The included studies did provide limited data relating to this review’s secondary outcomes.
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheter versus no catheter - three studies (840 women)
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a reduced incidence of bladder distension (non-prespecified outcome) at the end of the operation (risk ratio (RR) 0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.35; one study, 420 women) and fewer cases of retention of urine (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47; two studies, 420 women) or need for catheterisation (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16; three studies 840 participants).
<RES> In contrast, indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a longer time to first voiding (mean difference (MD) 16.81 hours, 95% CI 16.32 to 17.30; one study, 420 women) and more pain or discomfort due to catheterisation (and/or at first voiding) (average RR 10.47, 95% CI 4.71 to 23.25, two studies, 420 women) although high levels of heterogeneity were observed.
<RES> Similarly, compared to women in the ‘no catheter’ group, indwelling bladder catheterisation was associated with a longer time to ambulation (MD 4.34 hours, 95% CI 1.37 to 7.31, three studies, 840 women) and a longer stay in hospital (MD 0.62 days, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.10, three studies, 840 women).
<RES> However, high levels of heterogeneity were observed for these two outcomes and the results should be interpreted with caution.
<RES> There was no difference in postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony.
<RES> There was also no difference in the incidence of UTI (as defined by trialists) between the indwelling bladder catheterisation and no catheterisation groups (two studies, 570 women).
<RES> However, high levels of heterogeneity were observed for this non-prespecified outcome and results should be considered in this context.
<RES> Indwelling bladder catheter versus bladder drainage – two studies (225 women)
<RES> Two studies (225 women) compared the use of an indwelling bladder catheter versus bladder drainage.
<RES> There was no difference between groups in terms of retention of urine following CS, length of hospital stay or the non-prespecified outcome of UTI (as defined by the trialist).
<RES> There is some evidence (from one small study involving 50 women), that the need for catheterisation was reduced in the group of women with an indwelling bladder catheter (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.70) compared to women in the bladder drainage group.
<RES> Evidence from another small study (involving 175 women) suggests that women who had an indwelling bladder catheter had a longer time to ambulation (MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.55) compared to women who received bladder drainage.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review includes limited evidence from five RCTs of moderate quality.
<CON> The review's primary outcomes (bladder injury during operation and UTI), were either not reported or reported in a way not suitable for our analysis.
<CON> The evidence in this review is based on some secondary outcomes, with heterogeneity present in some of the analyses.
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to assess the routine use of indwelling bladder catheters in women undergoing CS.
<CON> There is a need for more rigorous RCTs, with adequate sample sizes, standardised criteria for the diagnosis of UTI and other common outcomes.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> About 1 in 5 adults suffer from moderate or severe chronic pain that is not caused by cancer.
<ABS> Some people with this type of pain are treated with opioids (typically with drugs like morphine, codeine, oxycodone, fentanyl, or buprenorphine, either as tablets or as patches placed on the skin).
<ABS> It is not unusual for this medication to be ineffective or to stop working over time, and, sometimes, effective pain relief is not achieved despite doses being increased.
<ABS> Stopping using opioid drugs is not easy, especially when they have been used for some time, because stopping abruptly can cause unpleasant side effects.
<ABS> This review looked for high quality studies (randomised controlled trials) of treatments to help people safely stop taking opioids prescribed for their pain.
<ABS> Only two studies were found, and they investigated only 86 people.
<ABS> No conclusions can be drawn from this small amount of information.
<ABS> Non-randomised studies, not included in this review, do indicate that in most people intensive rehabilitation packages can bring about major reduction in opioid use.
<ABS> Reducing prescribed opioid use in chronic non-cancer pain is an important topic in need of more research.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Patients with chronic non-cancer pain who are prescribed and are taking opioids can have a history of long term high dose opioid use without effective pain relief.
<INT> Simple unsupervised reduction of opioid use is clinically challenging, and very difficult to achieve and maintain.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Included studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing opioid users receiving an intervention with a control group receiving treatment as usual, active control, or placebo.
<MaM> The aim of the study had to include a treatment goal of dose reduction or cessation of opioid medication.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies provided information on 86 participants.
<RES> One compared electroacupuncture with sham acupuncture for 20 minutes twice a week for six weeks; there was no difference between treatments.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Both included studies were at significant risk of bias because of their small size, together with other important issues, including blinding.
<CON> Because of this risk and the paucity of relevant studies, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of interventions for opioid withdrawal in chronic non-cancer pain.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> A paucity of evidence is available to allow conclusions on whether combined inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are equivalent or superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation (flare-up) state bronchiectasis (Appendix 2).
<ABS> Review question: Is any evidence available to show that combined ICS-LABA is superior to placebo or ICS monotherapy for the treatment of stable or exacerbation state bronchiectasis in children and adults?
<ABS> Study characteristics: A small, single-centre, non-blinded study that compared inhaled ICS-LABA with high-dose ICS.
<ABS> Key results: A single study showed some benefit of the inhaled ICS-LABA combination over high-dose ICS in terms of indices of clinical stability such as dyspnoea (shortness of breath), cough-free days and number of exacerbations but failed to show significant improvement in lung function or microbiology.
<ABS> No data are available on children with bronchiectasis or adults with bronchiectasis during an exacerbation phase.
<ABS> Until further evidence becomes available, we recommend that use of combined ICS-LABA should be individualised according to the presence or likelihood of co-existing asthma features and risks of medications.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence: This review is based on a single study, hence the quality of evidence is substantially limited.
<ABS> Bottom line: The decision to use combined ICS-LABA in bronchiectasis must be made for individual patients on the basis of the presence or absence of bronchial hyperreactivity, until further randomised controlled trials are conducted to answer this important question.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Bronchiectasis is a major contributor to chronic respiratory morbidity and mortality worldwide.
<INT> Wheeze and other asthma-like symptoms and bronchial hyperreactivity may occur in people with bronchiectasis.
<INT> Physicians often use asthma treatments in patients with bronchiectasis.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Airways Group performed the latest searches in October 2013.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We found no RCTs comparing ICS and LABA combination with either placebo or usual care.
<RES> We included one RCT that compared combined ICS and LABA with high-dose ICS in 40 adults with non-CF bronchiectasis without co-existent asthma.
<RES> All participants received three months of high-dose budesonide dipropionate treatment (1600 micrograms).
<RES> After three months, participants were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose budesonide dipropionate (1600 micrograms per day) or a combination of budesonide with formoterol (640 micrograms of budesonide and 18 micrograms of formoterol) for three months.
<RES> The study was not blinded.
<RES> We assessed it to be an RCT with overall high risk of bias.
<RES> Data analysed in this review showed that those who received combined ICS-LABA (in stable state) had a significantly better transition dyspnoea index (mean difference (MD) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 2.18) and cough-free days (MD 12.30, 95% CI 2.38 to 22.2) compared with those receiving ICS after three months of treatment.
<RES> No significant difference was noted between groups in quality of life (MD -4.57, 95% CI -12.38 to 3.24), number of hospitalisations (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.79) or lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC)).
<RES> Investigators reported 37 adverse events in the ICS group versus 12 events in the ICS-LABA group but did not mention the number of individuals experiencing adverse events.
<RES> Hence differences between groups were not included in the analyses.
<RES> We assessed the overall evidence to be low quality.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In adults with bronchiectasis without co-existent asthma, during stable state, a small single trial with a high risk of bias suggests that combined ICS-LABA may improve dyspnoea and increase cough-free days in comparison with high-dose ICS.
<CON> No data are provided for or against, the use of combined ICS-LABA in adults with bronchiectasis during an acute exacerbation, or in children with bronchiectasis in a stable or acute state.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> During operations surgeons make a cut (incision) in the skin to gain access to the surgical site.
<ABS> Incisions are closed with sutures (stitches), staples, tissue adhesives or tapes.
<ABS> Sutures can be continuous or interrupted.
<ABS> Continuous sutures are usually inserted underneath the skin surface using absorbable or non-absorbable suture material.
<ABS> Interrupted sutures involve the full thickness of the skin and are usually non-absorbable (but not always).
<ABS> Impaired wound healing increases costs of health care and leads to poor cosmetic results.
<ABS> We investigated whether it is better to use continuous or interrupted sutures to close wounds after non-childbirth surgery by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared these two methods of skin closure (in August 2013).
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified five RCTs with a total of 827 participants.
<ABS> Seven hundred thirty participants (384 received continuous sutures and 346 interrupted sutures) provided data for this review.
<ABS> Participants had abdominal or groin operations.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The only outcomes reported were, superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound breakdown and length of hospital stay.
<ABS> No other important outcomes, including quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources, were reported.
<ABS> Approximately 6% of participants developed superficial surgical site infection, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed these.
<ABS> Approximately 4% of participants developed superficial wound breakdown.
<ABS> The proportion of participants with this problem in the continuous suture group was approximately one-tenth of that in the interrupted suture group.
<ABS> Most wound breakdowns occurred in two trials that used absorbable sutures for continuous suturing and non-absorbable sutures for interrupted suturing.
<ABS> Non-absorbable sutures are removed seven to nine days after surgery, but absorbable sutures are not removed, and so support the wound for longer - which may account for the difference in distribution of this problem between groups.
<ABS> There was no significant difference between groups for length of hospital stay.
<ABS> Superficial wound breakdown is reduced by continuous subcuticular suturing.
<ABS> However, the trials that contributed to this result had suture removal in only one group (interrupted sutures), which may have led to this observation.
<ABS> The number of participants included in this review was small and follow-up after surgery was short.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Levels of bias across the studies were mostly high or unclear, so there may have been flaws in trial organisation that could produce erroneous results.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin, allowing the surgeon to gain access to the surgical site.
<INT> Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure; this review focuses on these closed wounds.
<INT> There are many ways to close the surgical incision, for example, using sutures (stitches), staples, tissue adhesives or tapes.
<INT> Skin sutures can be continuous or interrupted.
<INT> In general, continuous sutures are usually subcuticular and can be absorbable or non-absorbable, while interrupted sutures are usually non-absorbable and involve the full thickness of the skin - although some surgeons do use absorbable interrupted sutures.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included all relevant RCTs in the analysis, irrespective of language of publication, publication status, publication year or sample size.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted data.
<MaM> We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary outcomes between the groups, and calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing continuous outcomes.
<MaM> We performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model.
<MaM> We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included five RCTs with a total of 827 participants.
<RES> Outcomes were available for 730 participants (384 participants randomised to continuous sutures and 346 participants to interrupted sutures).
<RES> All the trials were of unclear or high risk of bias.
<RES> The participants underwent abdominal or groin operations.
<RES> The only outcomes reported in the trials were superficial surgical site infection, superficial wound dehiscence (breakdown) and length of hospital stay.
<RES> Other important outcomes such as quality of life, long-term patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources were not reported in these trials.
<RES> Overall, 6.5% (39/602 participants, four trials) developed superficial surgical site infections.
<RES> There was no significant difference between the groups in the proportion of participants who developed superficial surgical site infections (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.40 to 1.33).
<RES> A total of 23 participants (23/625 (3.7%), four trials) developed superficial wound dehiscence.
<RES> Most of these wound dehiscences were reported in two recent trials in which the continuous skin suture groups received absorbable subcuticular sutures while the interrupted skin suture groups received non-absorbable transcutaneous sutures.
<RES> The non-absorbable sutures were removed seven to nine days after surgery in the interrupted sutures groups whilst sutures in the comparator groups were not removed, being absorbable.
<RES> The continuous suture technique with absorbable suture does not require suture removal and provides support for the wound for a longer period of time.
<RES> This may have contributed to the difference between the two groups in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence.
<RES> There was no significant difference in the length of the hospital stay between the two groups (MD -1.40 days; 95% CI -7.14 to 4.34).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Superficial wound dehiscence may be reduced by using continuous subcuticular sutures.
<CON> However, there is uncertainty about this because of the quality of the evidence.
<CON> Besides, the nature of the suture material used may have led to this observation, as the continuous suturing technique used suture material that did not need to be removed, whereas the comparator used interrupted (non-absorbable) sutures that did need to be removed.
<CON> Differences in the methods of skin closure have the potential to affect patient outcomes and use of healthcare resources.
<CON> Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary to determine which type of suturing is better.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Tai chi for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Tai Chi to prevent cardiovascular disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels that are a worldwide health burden.
<ABS> However, it is thought that CVD risk can be lowered by changing a number of modifiable behaviours including increasing levels of exercise, and relaxation to reduce stress levels, and both of these comprise tai chi.
<ABS> This review assessed the effectiveness of tai chi interventions for healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD at reducing cardiovascular death, all-cause death, non-fatal endpoints (such as heart attacks, strokes and angina) and CVD risk factors.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (clinical trials where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatments) looking at the effects of tai chi on adults at high risk of developing CVD.
<ABS> We did not included people who had already had CVD (e.g. heart attacks and strokes).
<ABS> The evidence is current to December 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found 13 trials, none of them were large enough or of long enough duration to examine the effects of tai chi on reducing cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal endpoints.
<ABS> There were variations in the duration and style of tai chi and the follow-up of the interventions ranged from three to 12 months.
<ABS> Due to the small number of short-term studies and the variability between them, we were unable to determine conclusively whether or not tai chi was beneficial at reducing cardiovascular risk in healthy adults and adults at increased risk of CVD, although beneficial effects for CVD risk factors were seen in some studies.
<ABS> None of the included studies reported on adverse events.
<ABS> Longer-term, high-quality trials are needed in order to determine the effectiveness of tai chi for CVD prevention.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The results of this review should be treated with caution as the studies were small, of short duration and there was some risk of bias (where there was a risk of arriving at the wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the participants or researchers).

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To determine the effectiveness of tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We applied no language restrictions.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials of tai chi lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD.
<MaM> The comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention.
<MaM> The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and CVD risk factors.
<MaM> We excluded trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions or focusing on weight loss to avoid confounding.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 13 small trials (1520 participants randomised) and three ongoing trials.
<RES> All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias, and some studies were at high risk of bias for allocation concealment (one study) and selective reporting (two studies).
<RES> Duration and style of tai chi differed between trials.
<RES> Seven studies recruited 903 healthy participants, the other studies recruited people with borderline hypertension or hypertension, elderly people at high risk of falling, and people with hypertension with liver and kidney yin deficiency syndrome.
<RES> No studies reported on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events as most studies were short term (all studies had follow-up of one year or less).
<RES> Nine trials measured blood pressure, six individual trials found reductions in SBP (reductions ranged from -22.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -17.7) to -11.5 mmHg (95% CI -21.5 to -1.46)), two trials found no clear evidence of a difference (however, CIs were wide and an increase or decrease in SBP cannot be ruled out), and one trial found an increase in SBP with tai chi (increase 5.2 mmHg, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.67).
<RES> A similar pattern was seen for DBP: three trials found a reduction in DBP (reductions ranged from -12.2 mmHg (95% CI -15.8 to -8.7) to -4.43 mmHg (95% CI -7.14 to -1.72)) and three trials found no clear evidence of a difference, however again with wide CIs.
<RES> Quality of life was measured in one trial: tai chi improved quality of life at three months.
<RES> None of the included trials reported on adverse events, costs or occurrence of type 2 diabetes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There are currently no long-term trials examining tai chi for the primary prevention of CVD.
<CON> Due to the limited evidence available currently no conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of tai chi on CVD risk factors.
<CON> There was some suggestion of beneficial effects of tai chi on CVD risk factors but this was not consistent across all studies.
<CON> There was considerable heterogeneity between the studies included in this review and studies were small and at some risk of bias.
<CON> Results of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base but additional longer-term, high-quality trials are needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> This review considered the question of whether vitamin C may be helpful for people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Asthma is an inflammatory lung condition characterised by the narrowing of airways and is associated with wheezing, breathlessness, cough and chest tightness.
<ABS> Vitamin C has been suggested as a possible treatment for asthma.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> Eleven studies on 419 people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness were included in this review comparing vitamin C compared to placebo (no vitamin C).
<ABS> Most studies were in adults and one small study was in children.
<ABS> The small number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that we were only able to describe individual studies, rather than pooling the results together to get an average from the trials.
<ABS> The study design was not well described in most study reports and therefore it was impossible to determine risk of bias for most of the studies.
<ABS> There was very little data available in the trials for our key outcomes and this may indicate some selective outcome reporting.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was no indication of benefit from the studies that considered vitamin C in relation to asthma.
<ABS> However, it is not possible to form any clear conclusions on the basis of those studies at this stage.
<ABS> The review concludes that there is insufficient evidence currently available to evaluate the use of vitamin C as a treatment in asthma.
<ABS> Larger, well-designed research is needed to provide clearer guidance.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Details of the way patients were allocated to receive vitamin C or not were not clearly described in 10 of the 11 studies and we considered this carefully in the review in relation to our level of uncertainty in interpreting the results.
<ABS> Taking this into account, together with the imprecision of the results, we judged the estimates of the usefulness of vitamin C as a treatment to be of either low or moderate quality in relation to asthma.
<ABS> Additionally, for exercise-induced breathlessness the three studies providing data to the review were small and we are mindful of the need to draw very cautious conclusions about the results.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of December 2012.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, in the epithelial lining and lining fluids of the lung may be beneficial in the reduction of oxidative damage (Arab 2002).
<INT> However, the association between dietary antioxidants and asthma severity or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is not fully understood.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR).
<MaM> We also searched trial registry websites.
<MaM> The searches were conducted in December 2012.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
<MaM> In separate analyses we considered trials with a diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (or exercise-induced asthma).
<MaM> We included trials comparing vitamin C supplementation with placebo, or vitamin C supplementation with no supplementation.
<MaM> We included trials where the asthma management of both treatment and control groups provided similar background therapy.
<MaM> The primary focus of the review is on daily vitamin C supplementation to prevent exacerbations and improve HRQL.
<MaM> The short-term use of vitamin C at the time of exacerbations or for cold symptoms in people with asthma are outside the scope of this review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 11 trials with 419 participants met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> In 10 studies the participants were adults and only one was in children.
<RES> Four studies were parallel-group and the remainder were cross-over studies.
<RES> Eight studies included people with asthma and three studies included 40 participants with exercise-induced asthma.
<RES> Five studies reported results using single-dose regimes prior to bronchial challenges or exercise tests.
<RES> There was marked heterogeneity in vitamin C dosage regimes used in the selected studies, compounding the difficulties in carrying out meaningful analyses.
<RES> One study on 201 adults with asthma reported no significant difference in our primary outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and overall the quality of this evidence was low.
<RES> There were no data available to evaluate the effects of vitamin C supplementation on our other primary outcome, exacerbations in adults.
<RES> One small study reported data on asthma exacerbations in children and there were no exacerbations in either the vitamin C or placebo groups (very low quality evidence).
<RES> In another study conducted in 41 adults, exacerbations were not defined according to our criteria and the data were not available in a format suitable for evaluation by our methods.
<RES> Lung function and symptoms data were contributed by single studies.
<RES> We rated the quality of this evidence as moderate, but further research is required to assess any clinical implications that may be related to the changes in these parameters.
<RES> In each of these outcomes there was no significant difference between vitamin C and placebo.
<RES> No adverse events at all were reported; again this is very low quality evidence.
<RES> Studies in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction suggested some improvement in lung function measures with vitamin C supplementation, but theses studies were few and very small, with limited data and we judged the quality of the evidence to be low.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, evidence is not available to provide a robust assessment on the use of vitamin C in the management of asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
<CON> Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect and is likely to change the estimates.
<CON> There is no indication currently that vitamin C can be recommended as a therapeutic agent in asthma.
<CON> There was some indication that vitamin C was helpful in exercise-induced breathlessness in terms of lung function and symptoms; however, as these findings were provided only by small studies they are inconclusive.
<CON> Most published studies to date are too small and inconsistent to provide guidance.
<CON> Well-designed trials with good quality clinical endpoints, such as exacerbation rates and health-related quality of life scores, are required.

<H1> Face-to-face interventions for promoting physical activity

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Face-to-face interventions for promoting physical activity

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Participating in insufficient amounts of physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases, and physical and mental health problems.
<ABS> Regular physical activity should be a goal for all adults and can provide social, emotional and physical health benefits.
<ABS> The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels.
<ABS> We included a total of 10 studies recruiting 6292 apparently healthy adults in this review.
<ABS> The findings of the review indicate that interventions can successfully support adults' attempts to become active and fitter, for example with personal counselling and advice, feedback and offering choices of exercise, and supervision.
<ABS> Outcomes are improved if the intervention comprises a specified type of physical activity and is supervised by a non-health professional using a combination of group and individual approaches.
<ABS> New physical activity can be maintained for up to at least one year and does not increase the risk of falls or exercise related injuries.
<ABS> More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion work best in the long term to encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and some other databases (from earliest dates available to October 2012).
<MaM> Reference lists of relevant articles were checked.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared face-to-face PA interventions for community dwelling adults with a placebo or no or minimal intervention control group.
<MaM> We included studies if the principal component of the intervention was delivered using face-to-face methods.
<MaM> To assess behavioural change over time the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results.
<MaM> We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted data.
<MaM> Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary.
<MaM> Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous measures of self-reported PA and cardio-respiratory fitness.
<MaM> For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 10 studies recruiting 6292 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> All of the studies took place in high-income countries.
<RES> The effect of interventions on self-reported PA at one year (eight studies; 6725 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity (I² = 74%) (SMD 0.19; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.31; moderate quality evidence) but not sustained in three studies at 24 months (4235 participants) (SMD 0.18; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.46).
<RES> The effect of interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 349 participants) was positive and moderate with no significant heterogeneity in the observed effects (SMD 0.50; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.71; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> Three studies (3277 participants) reported a positive effect on increasing PA levels when assessed as a dichotomous measure at 12 months, but this was not statistically significant (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.88 to 2.61; high quality evidence).
<RES> Although there were limited data, there was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (one study; 149 participants).
<RES> Risk of bias was assessed as low (four studies; 4822 participants) or moderate (six studies; 1543 participants).
<RES> Any conclusions drawn from this review require some caution given the significant heterogeneity in the observed effects.
<RES> Despite this, there was some indication that the most effective interventions were those that offered both individual and group support for changing PA levels using a tailored approach.
<RES> The long term impact, cost effectiveness and rates of adverse events for these interventions was not established because the majority of studies stopped after 12 months.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Due to the clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the studies, only limited conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of individual components of the interventions.
<CON> Future studies should provide greater detail of the components of interventions, and assess impact on quality of life, adverse events and economic data.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Participating in insufficient amounts of physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases, and physical and mental health problems.
<ABS> Regular physical activity should be a goal for all adults and it can provide social, emotional and physical health benefits.
<ABS> The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels.
<ABS> We looked at studies that had compared two approaches to promoting physical activity (face-to-face with a professional versus using technologies that enabled remote prescription) to decide which approach was better.
<ABS> We know from other work that both approaches are successful.
<ABS> We found only one study with 225 apparently healthy adults in the medical literature to answer our question.
<ABS> Therefore, we remain unclear about which approach is best for promoting physical activity and cardio-respiratory fitness.
<ABS> We are also unable to comment authoritatively on adverse events and the influence of the delivery method.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and some other databases (from earliest dates available to October 2012).
<MaM> Reference lists of relevant articles were checked.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised trials that compared face-to-face versus remote and web 2.0 PA interventions for community dwelling adults.
<MaM> To assess behavioural change over time, the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results.
<MaM> We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two review authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted the data.
<MaM> Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist.
<MaM> Study authors were contacted for additional information where necessary.
<MaM> Standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous measures of cardio-respiratory fitness.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One study recruiting 225 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> This study took place in a high-income country.
<RES> From 27,299 hits, the full texts of 193 papers were retrieved for examination against the inclusion criteria.
<RES> However, there was only one paper that met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> This study reported the effect of a PA intervention on cardio-respiratory fitness.
<RES> There were no reported data for PA, quality of life, or cost effectiveness.
<RES> The difference between the remote and web 2.0 versus face-to-face arms was not significant (SMD -0.02; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; high quality evidence).
<RES> The risk of bias in the included study was assessed as low, and there was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Participating in insufficient amounts of physical activity leads to an increased risk of a number of chronic diseases, and physical and mental health problems.
<ABS> Regular physical activity should be a goal for all adults and it can provide social, emotional and physical health benefits.
<ABS> The majority of adults are not active at recommended levels.
<ABS> We included a total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults in this review.
<ABS> The findings of the review indicate that using technologies to support adults' attempts to become more active, achieve the recommended weekly amounts of activity, or become fitter are successful.
<ABS> Changes can be achieved with help from a trained professional and through personal support via telephone, e-mail, or written information.
<ABS> New physical activity can be maintained for at least one year and it does not increase the risk of falls or exercise related injuries.
<ABS> More research is needed to establish which methods of exercise promotion encourage specific groups of people to be more physically active in the long term.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Reference lists of relevant articles were checked.
<MaM> No language restrictions were applied.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared remote and web 2.0 PA interventions for community dwelling adults with a placebo or no or minimal intervention control group.
<MaM> We included studies if the principal component of the intervention was delivered using remote or web 2.0 technologies (for example the internet, smart phones) or more traditional methods (for example telephone, mail-outs), or both.
<MaM> To assess behavioural change over time, the included studies had a minimum of 12 months follow-up from the start of the intervention to the final results.
<MaM> We excluded studies that had more than a 20% loss to follow-up if they did not apply an intention-to-treat analysis.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> At least two authors independently assessed the quality of each study and extracted the data.
<MaM> Non-English language papers were reviewed with the assistance of an interpreter who was an epidemiologist.

<MaM> For studies with dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> A total of 11 studies recruiting 5862 apparently healthy adults met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> All of the studies took place in high-income countries.
<RES> The effect of the interventions on cardiovascular fitness at one year (two studies; 444 participants) was positive and moderate with significant heterogeneity of the observed effects (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.76; high quality evidence).
<RES> The effect of the interventions on self-reported PA at one year (nine studies; 4547 participants) was positive and moderate (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.28; moderate quality evidence) with heterogeneity (I2 = 37%) in the observed effects.
<RES> One study reported positive results at two years (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.32; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> When studies were stratified by risk of bias, the studies at low risk of bias (eight studies; 3403 participants) had an increased effect (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40; moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The most effective interventions applied a tailored approach to the type of PA and used telephone contact to provide feedback and to support changes in PA levels.
<RES> There was no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events (seven studies; 2892 participants).
<RES> Risk of bias was assessed as low (eight studies; 3060 participants) or moderate (three studies; 2677 participants).
<RES> There were no differences in effectiveness between studies using different types of professionals delivering the intervention (for example health professional, exercise specialist).
<RES> There was no difference in pooled estimates between studies that generated the prescribed PA using an automated computer programme versus a human, nor between studies that used pedometers as part of their intervention compared to studies that did not.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found consistent evidence to support the effectiveness of remote and web 2.0 interventions for promoting PA.
<CON> These interventions have positive, moderate sized effects on increasing self-reported PA and measured cardio-respiratory fitness, at least at 12 months.
<CON> The effectiveness of these interventions was supported by moderate and high quality studies.
<CON> However, there continues to be a paucity of cost effectiveness data and studies that include participants from varying socioeconomic or ethnic groups.
<CON> To better understand the independent effect of individual programme components, longer term studies, with at least one year follow-up, are required.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The issue
<ABS> Women with vulval cancer that has spread to the groin lymph nodes need additional treatment.
<ABS> The standard treatment usually involves surgical removal of as many groin nodes as possible (known as complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL)).
<ABS> However, only about 30% of women with vulval cancer in whom lymph nodes are not obviously enlarged will have groin involvement; therefore, in about 70% of these women additional surgery is not necessary.
<ABS> Sentinel node assessment involves identifying the main lymph node/s draining the tumour.
<ABS> After the main (sentinel) nodes are identified, they are removed and examined under a microscope to check for cancer cells.
<ABS> Additional surgery depends on the findings of the examination: if cancer cells are found in the nodes, additional surgery is necessary; if the nodes are cancer-free, additional surgery can be avoided.
<ABS> Why is this review important?
<ABS> Several studies have been done using dyes or traceable agents to identify sentinel nodes.
<ABS> From these studies, it is not clear whether all of these agents are sufficiently accurate to predict which women have cancerous spread to the groin.
<ABS> This review summarises the evidence and produces overall estimates of the relative accuracies of the available tests.
<ABS> How was the review conducted?
<ABS> We included all studies that tested the accuracy of tracer agent/s against the standard method of identifying cancer in the groin nodes (removing all groin nodes (IFL) and examining them under a microscope).
<ABS> Women in these studies had vulval cancer of Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB or higher without obvious signs of cancer in the groin (enlarged or palpable nodes).
<ABS> We only included studies of at least 10 women, and noted any concerns about the quality of studies.
<ABS> What are the findings?
<ABS> We included 34 studies (1614 women) that evaluated three techniques: blue dye only, technetium (a radioactive substance) only, or blue dye and technetium combined.
<ABS> Ten studies used all three techniques during the course of the study (one technique per participant).
<ABS> There are two attributes to a test: the ability to identify or detect the sentinel node, and the ability to identify the cancer in the sentinel node.
<ABS> We found that all tests can identify cancer in the groin nodes with good accuracy (more than 90% of nodes with cancer will be accurately identified with any of the tests), although the combined test was the most accurate (95%).
<ABS> The ability of the tests to detect sentinel nodes varied, with the blue dye test only detecting sentinel nodes in 82% of women, compared with 98% for the combined test.
<ABS> If sentinel nodes are not detected, they cannot be examined for cancer cells; therefore, women in whom sentinel nodes are not detected will usually need to undergo IFL.
<ABS> What does this mean?
<ABS> The combined and technetium only tests are able to predict accurately which women have cancerous spread to the groin.
<ABS> For a group of 100 women undergoing assessment, the findings mean that approximately one or fewer women having the combined or technetium only tests will undergo an unnecessary IFL, compared with approximately 11 women having the blue dye only test.
<ABS> This is mainly because the blue dye only test is not as good as technetium in identifying sentinel nodes.
<ABS> Fewer women with spread to the groin will be missed with the combined or technetium only tests (1 to 3 out of 30) compared with the blue dye only test (1 to 8 out of 30).
<ABS> It is not clear whether women with negative sentinel nodes (i.e. no spread of cancer to the groin lymph nodes) who do not undergo IFL will live as long as those who undergo IFL.
<ABS> The current best data on survival come from a Dutch study that followed up 259 women with negative sentinel nodes and reported a three-year survival of 97%.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Vulval cancer is usually treated by wide local excision with removal of groin lymph nodes (inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy) from one or both sides, depending on the tumour location.
<INT> However, this procedure is associated with significant morbidity.
<INT> As lymph node metastasis occurs in about 30% of women with early vulval cancer, accurate prediction of lymph node metastases could reduce the extent of surgery in many women, thereby reducing morbidity.
<INT> Sentinel node assessment is a diagnostic technique that uses traceable agents to identify the spread of cancer cells to the lymph nodes draining affected tissue.
<INT> Once the sentinel nodes are identified, they are removed and submitted to histological examination.
<INT> This technique has been found to be useful in diagnosing the nodal involvement of other types of tumours.
<INT> Sentinel node assessment in vulval cancer has been evaluated with various tracing agents.
<INT> It is unclear which tracing agent or combination of agents is most accurate.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors (TAL, AP) independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance, classified studies for inclusion/exclusion and extracted data.
<MaM> We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool.
<MaM> We used univariate meta-analytical methods to estimate pooled sensitivity estimates.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 34 studies evaluating 1614 women and approximately 2396 groins.
<RES> The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate.
<RES> The studies included in this review used the following traceable techniques to identify sentinel nodes in their participants: blue dye only (three studies), technetium only (eight studies), blue dye plus technetium combined (combined tests; 13 studies) and various inconsistent combinations of these three techniques (mixed tests; 10 studies).
<RES> For studies of mixed tests, we obtained separate test data where possible.
<RES> Most studies used haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains for the histological examination.
<RES> Additionally an immunohistochemical (IHC) stain with and without ultrastaging was employed by 14 and eight studies, respectively.
<RES> One study used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis (CA9 RT-PCR), whilst three studies did not describe the histological methods used.
<RES> The pooled sensitivity estimate for studies using blue dye only was 0.94 (68 women; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.99), for mixed tests was 0.91 (679 women; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98), for technetium only was 0.93 (149 women; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96) and for combined tests was 0.95 (390 women; 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97).
<RES> Negative predictive values (NPVs) for all index tests were > 95%.
<RES> Most studies also reported sentinel node detection rates (the ability of the test to identify a sentinel node) of the index test.
<RES> The mean detection rate for blue dye alone was 82%, compared with 95%, 96% and 98% for mixed tests, technetium only and combined tests, respectively.
<RES> We estimated the clinical consequences of the various tests for 100 women undergoing the sentinel node procedure, assuming the prevalence of groin metastases to be 30%.
<RES> For the combined or technetium only tests, one and two women with groin metastases might be 'missed', respectively (95% CI 1 to 3); and for mixed tests, three women with groin metastases might be 'missed' (95% CI 1 to 9).
<RES> The wide CIs associated with the pooled sensitivity estimates for blue dye and mixed tests increased the potential for these tests to 'miss' women with groin metastases.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is little difference in diagnostic test accuracy between the technetium and combined tests.
<CON> The combined test may reduce the number of women with 'missed' groin node metastases compared with technetium only.
<CON> Blue dye alone may be associated with more 'missed' cases compared with tests using technetium.
<CON> Sentinel node assessment with technetium-based tests will reduce the need for IFL by 70% in women with early vulval cancer.
<CON> It is not yet clear how the survival of women with negative sentinel nodes compares to those undergoing standard surgery (IFL).
<CON> A randomised controlled trial of sentinel node dissection and IFL has methodological and ethical issues, therefore more observational data on the survival of women with early vulval cancer are needed.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Low dose naltrexone for induction of remission in Crohn's disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Low dose naltrexone for treatment of active Crohn’s disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut, which can affect people anywhere from the mouth to anus.
<ABS> Specific hormones (proteins that transmit instructions in the body) that are known to be involved in pain response may be involved in the inflammation that underlies Crohn’s disease.
<ABS> Perhaps by giving patients a low dose of one of these proteins called naltrexone Crohn’s disease can be improved.
<ABS> The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness and safety (i.e. side effects) of low dose naltrexone therapy for inducing remission in people with active Crohn's disease.
<ABS> This review identified two small randomized controlled trials that included a total of 46 participants.
<ABS> One study compared 12 weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (4.5 mg/day) to a placebo (i.e. a fake drug such as a sugar pill) in 34 adult patients with active Crohn’s disease.
<ABS> The other study compared eight weeks of treatment with low dose naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg up to a maximum 4.5 mg/day) to a placebo in 12 children with active Crohn's disease.
<ABS> The results from both studies were imprecise with regard to the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission.
<ABS> The results of the study in adult patients suggest that low dose naltrexone may provide a benefit in terms of clinical response (i.e. an improvement in disease symptoms) and endoscopic response (i.e. a reduction in inflammation of the gut as shown by examining the gut with a scope).
<ABS> We could not tell whether low dose naltrexone led to specific side effects including sleep disturbance, unusual dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue due to the low number of people who experienced these problems in the studies.
<ABS> The results of this review need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low due to lack of precision of the results.
<ABS> Thus no firm conclusions can be made regarding the effectiveness and side effect profile of low dose naltrexone treatment for patients with active Crohn's disease.
<ABS> Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of low dose naltrexone therapy in active Crohn's disease in both adults and children.
<ABS> One study is currently ongoing and results should be available in 2014 or 2015.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Crohn’s disease is a transmural, relapsing inflammatory condition afflicting the digestive tract.
<INT> Low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has garnered interest as a potential therapy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis using Review Manager (RevMan 5.2).
<MaM> The primary outcome was induction of clinical remission defined by a Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150 or a pediatric Crohn's disease activity index (PCDAI) of < 10.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes included clinical response (70- or 100-point decrease in CDAI from baseline), endoscopic remission or response, quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies.
<MaM> Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.
<MaM> The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
<MaM> The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Two studies were identified (46 participants).
<RES> One study assessed the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of LDN (4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in adult patients (N = 34).
<RES> The other study assessed eight weeks of LDN (0.1 mg/kg, maximum 4.5 mg/day) treatment compared to placebo in pediatric patients (N = 12).
<RES> The primary purpose of the pediatric study was to assess safety and tolerability.
<RES> Both studies were rated as having a low risk of bias.
<RES> The study in adult patients reported that 30% (5/18) of LDN treated patients achieved clinical remission at 12 weeks compared to 18% (3/16) of placebo patients, a difference that was not statistically significant (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.24).
<RES> The study in children reported that 25% of LDN treated patients achieved clinical remission (PCDAI < 10) compared to none of the patients in the placebo group, although it was unclear if this result was for the randomized placebo-controlled trial or for the open label extension study.
<RES> In the adult study 70-point clinical response rates were significantly higher in those treated with LDN than placebo.
<RES> Eighty-three per cent (15/18) of LDN patients had a 70-point clinical response at week 12 compared to 38% (6/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.32).
<RES> The effect of LDN on the proportion of adult patients who achieved a 100-point clinical response was uncertain.
<RES> Sixty-one per cent (11/18) of LDN patients achieved a 100-point clinical response compared to 31% (5/16) of placebo patients (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.42).
<RES> The proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic response (CDEIS decline > 5 from baseline) was significantly higher in the LDN group compared to placebo.
<RES> Seventy-two per cent (13/18) of LDN patients achieved an endoscopic response compared to 25% (4/16) of placebo patients (RR 2.89; 95% CI 1.18 to 7.08).
<RES> However, there was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved endoscopic remission.
<RES> Endoscopic remission (CDEIS < 3) was achieved in 22% (4/18) of the LDN group compared to 0% (0/16) of the placebo group (RR 8.05; 95% CI 0.47 to 138.87).
<RES> Pooled data from both studies show no statistically significant differences in withdrawals due to adverse events or specific adverse events including sleep disturbance, unusual dreams, headache, decreased appetite, nausea and fatigue.
<RES> No serious adverse events were reported in either study.
<RES> GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes (i.e. clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic response, and adverse events) as low due to serious imprecision (sparse data).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of LDN used to treat patients with active Crohn's disease.
<CON> Data from one small study suggests that LDN may provide a benefit in terms of clinical and endoscopic response in adult patients with active Crohn’s disease.
<CON> Data from two small studies suggest that LDN does not increase the rate of specific adverse events relative to placebo.
<CON> However, these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on very small numbers of patients and the overall quality of the evidence was rated as low due to serious imprecision.
<CON> Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of LDN therapy in active Crohn's disease in both adults and children.
<CON> One study is currently ongoing (NCT01810185).


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body.
<ABS> It begins in the heart and provides oxygen to all parts of the body.
<ABS> Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the inner wall of the aorta and bleeding occurs between the inner and outer walls of the blood vessel.
<ABS> It is a severe and often lethal complication.
<ABS> High blood pressure (hypertension) may be a key cause.
<ABS> Other risk factors may include connective tissue disorders, congenital vascular disease (abnormalities present at birth), aortitis (inflammation of the aortic wall), trauma or iatrogenic causes (problems resulting from medical treatment).
<ABS> Chronic type B aortic dissections are typically managed with medical therapy to reduce the stress on the aorta.
<ABS> Current practice guidelines suggest the use of beta-blockers as a first-line treatment.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We searched scientific databases for randomized controlled trials (studies where people are randomly allocated to treated groups) comparing beta-blockers versus other drugs used in the treatment of hypertension.
<ABS> The studies had to include people with thoracic aortic dissection of any cause that had not been treated with surgery.
<ABS> The evidence is current to January 2014.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found no randomized controlled trials.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> As of January 2014, there is no evidence to show that beta-blockers are superior to other antihypertensive medications as a first-line treatment.
<ABS> Randomized control trials are needed to determine the best treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Thoracic aortic dissection (TAD) is a severe and often lethal complication in people with hypertension.
<INT> Current practice in the treatment of chronic type B aortic dissections is the use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy to decrease aortic wall stress.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) for related reviews.
<MaM> We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (1946 to 26 January 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to 24 January 2014), MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE (1974 to 24 January 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (to 26 January 2014).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different antihypertensive medications in the treatment of chronic type B TAD to be eligible for inclusion.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors (KC, PL) independently reviewed titles and abstracts and decided on studies to include based on the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> We resolved discrepancies between the two review authors by discussion.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Therefore, there is no RCT evidence to support the current guidelines recommending the use of beta-blockers.
<CON> RCTs are required to assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers and other antihypertensive medications as first-line treatment of chronic type B TAD.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Hyaluronidase for reducing perineal trauma

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Vaginal deliveries are associated with perineal trauma that may be unexpected tears or surgical as a result of episiotomy.
<ABS> Many techniques have been used to prevent perineal trauma, such as antenatal perineal massage or perineum warm compresses.
<ABS> Their effectiveness in reducing perineal trauma has been identified by researchers.
<ABS> Perineal hyaluronidase (HAase) injection was widely used in the 1950s and 1960s to reduce the occurrence of perineal trauma, pain, and the need for episiotomy.
<ABS> The review authors searched the medical literature for randomised controlled trials that compared perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour with perineal placebo injection or no intervention.
<ABS> They identified four randomised controlled trials involving 599 women (with data available for 595 women).
<ABS> The methodological quality of two out of the four trials included in this review was poor.
<ABS> Two trials involving 283 women compared the effects of perineal HAase injection with placebo injection during second stage of labour and were at low risk of bias.
<ABS> Three trials (one three-armed trial was analysed twice) with 373 women compared the effects of perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour with no intervention.
<ABS> The overall results showed that perineal HAase injection had a significantly lower incidence of perineal trauma compared with control or no intervention, but there was no difference in the incidence of episiotomy, first and second degree and more severe (third and fourth degree) perineal tears.
<ABS> There was no clear evidence that HAase injection lowered the incidence of perineal trauma, episiotomy, first and second degree and more severe (third and fourth degree) perineal tears when compared with placebo injection.
<ABS> No side effects were reported in the included trials.
<ABS> Other measures such as perineal pain and other pre-specified secondary outcomes were not measured by the included trials.
<ABS> The difference in the incidence of perineal trauma may be due to bias and confounding in the non-placebo controlled comparison, this result should be interpreted cautiously.
<ABS> The potential use of this intervention as a method to reduce perineal trauma are yet to be determined as there was no appropriate established dose for HAase, no evidence of follow-up and side effects, and the number of high-quality trials and outcomes reported was too limited to draw conclusions on its effectiveness and safety.
<ABS> Further rigorous randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of perineal HAase injection in vaginal deliveries.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We also contacted relevant organisations.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality.
<MaM> Data were checked for accuracy.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified six potentially eligible studies.
<RES> Two studies were excluded.
<RES> We included four randomised controlled trials that randomised a total of 599 women (data were available for 595 women).
<RES> Two trials (283 women) compared the effects of perineal HAase injection during the second stage of labour with placebo injection and were at low risk of bias.
<RES> Three trials (one three-armed trial was analysed twice) (373 women) compared the effects of perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour with no intervention and two out of the three trials were at high risk of bias.
<RES> No side effects were reported in the included trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Perineal HAase injection during second stage of labour had a lower incidence of perineal trauma compared with control or no intervention, but there was no clear evidence of benefit compared with placebo injection.
<CON> The difference in incidence of perineal trauma may probably be due to bias and confounding in the non-placebo controlled comparison, this result should be interpreted cautiously.
<CON> The potential use of perineal HAase injection as a method to reduce perineal trauma were yet to be determined as there was no appropriate established dose for HAase, no evidence of follow up, and the number of high-quality trials and outcomes reported were too limited to draw conclusions on its effectiveness and safety.
<CON> Further rigorous randomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of perineal HAase injection in vaginal deliveries.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening condition where the aorta enlarges and can ultimately burst leading to massive internal bleeding.
<ABS> Current guidelines recommend that AAAs ≥ 55 mm should be surgically repaired as at this size the risk of rupture outweighs the risk of surgical repair.
<ABS> AAAs between 30 and 54 mm in size are not as high risk and are generally monitored by regular scans to check for further enlargement.
<ABS> Recent research has shown that even after the aneurysm is repaired, the survival rate in people with AAA is poorer than in people without AAA.
<ABS> In the majority of cases, the cause of death is a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or a stroke.
<ABS> Conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol increase the risk of cardiovascular death.
<ABS> However, both conditions can be reversed through medical treatment.
<ABS> Given the increased risk of mortality with AAA, it is important to determine which medical treatment is most effective in preventing cardiovascular death in people with AAA.
<ABS> In this review, the effectiveness of medical treatment to treat vascular risk factors and reduce cardiovascular deaths and events in people with an AAA was studied.
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, one study was found in which a subgroup of 227 people with AAA were randomised to receive the beta-blocker metoprolol or a placebo.
<ABS> The results from the included study were imprecise for all causes of death and death from cardiovascular disease or nonfatal cardiovascular events at 30 days or six months after AAA repair.
<ABS> Adverse drug effects were reported for the whole study population and were not available for the subgroup of participants with AAA.
<ABS> The study was deemed to be at a generally low risk of bias.
<ABS> Research with larger and longer duration trials is needed to determine which treatment is most effective.
<ABS> At present people with AAA are offered a wide range of pharmacological treatment including antiplatelet drugs, antihypertensives and lipid-lowering drugs.
<ABS> Future trials should test available drugs to find the most effective strategy, whether that be one single drug or a combination of treatments.
<ABS> In addition, the acceptability of such interventions needs to be assessed and future studies should measure adverse side effects associated with these drugs and their impact on quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pharmacological prophylaxis has been proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic occlusive arterial disease.
<INT> However, the role of prophylaxis in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unclear.
<INT> Several studies have shown that despite successful repair, those with AAA have a poorer rate of survival than healthy controls.
<INT> People with AAA have an increased prevalence of coronary heart disease and risk of cardiovascular events.
<INT> Despite this association, little is known about the effectiveness of pharmacological prophylaxis in reducing cardiovascular risk in people with AAA.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched April 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 3).
<MaM> Reference lists of relevant articles were also checked.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials in which people with AAA were randomly allocated to one prophylactic treatment versus another, a different regimen of the same treatment, a placebo, or no treatment were eligible for inclusion in this review.
<MaM> Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.
<MaM> Only one study was included in the review, therefore meta-analysis could not be performed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One randomised controlled study was included in the review.
<RES> A subgroup of 227 patients with AAA received either metoprolol (N = 111) or placebo (N = 116).
<RES> There was no clear evidence that metoprolol reduced all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.41), cardiovascular death (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.76), AAA-related death (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.06 to 16.92) or increased nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.57) 30 days postoperatively.
<RES> Furthermore, at six months postoperatively, estimated effects were compatible with benefit and harm for all-cause mortality (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.95), cardiovascular death (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.39) and nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.35).
<RES> Adverse drug effects were reported for the whole study population and were not available for the subgroup of participants with AAA.
<RES> The study was deemed to be at a generally low risk of bias.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Due to the limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of cardiovascular prophylaxis in reducing mortality and cardiovascular events in people with AAA.
<CON> Further good-quality randomised controlled trials examining many types of prophylaxis with long-term follow-up are required before firm conclusions can be made.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Globally, a woman's risk of developing cancer of the cervix, ovaries or uterus by the age of 65 is 2.2%; cancers of the vulva and vagina are less common.
<ABS> The biology of recurrent ovarian cancer differs from that of other gynaecological cancers; it is often responsive to chemotherapy and is not included in this review.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> Unfortunately, in some women with gynaecological cancer, the disease will return (recur) or progress after initial treatment.
<ABS> Cancer recurrence is defined as the return of cancer after treatment and after a period during which the cancer is undetectable.
<ABS> Although the surgical management of early cancers is relatively straightforward, with lower associated morbidity and mortality, the surgical management of advanced and recurrent cancer is significantly more complicated, often requiring very extensive operations.
<ABS> Pelvic exenterative surgery involves removal of some or all of the pelvic organs, including lower bowel (rectum with or without the sigmoid colon and sometimes the anal canal), bladder, reproductive organs (including womb, fallopian tubes, ovaries, vagina and vulva), pelvic peritoneum (the membrane that lines the pelvis and pelvic organs) and sometimes the perineum (external area around the vagina and anus), with reconstruction.
<ABS> The intent of exenterative surgery should be resection of all tumour with clear histological margins with the aim of cure.
<ABS> It is radical, often mutilating, surgery that is associated with significant postoperative side effects (morbidity) and risk of death (mortality), and it is a major undertaking for both patient and surgeon.
<ABS> However, it may be the only potentially curative treatment option for women with recurrent cancer.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> Although two review authors independently checked 1311 articles identified by searching, we found no relevant studies that were suitable for inclusion in the review.
<ABS> Therefore, no evidence is currently available from which to determine whether exenterative surgery is better than, equivalent to or worse than non-surgical treatment in terms of prolonged survival, treatment-related complications and impact on quality of life.
<ABS> This review highlights the need for good-quality studies comparing exenterative surgery versus non-surgical treatment in women with recurrent gynaecological cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Unfortunately, given the nature of the disease, cancer can recur or progress in some patients.
<INT> Although the management of early-stage cancers is relatively straightforward, with lower associated morbidity and mortality, the surgical management of advanced and recurrent cancers (including persistent or progressive cancers) is significantly more complicated, often requiring very extensive procedures.
<INT> Pelvic exenterative surgery involves removal of some or all of the pelvic organs.
<INT> Exenterative surgery for persistent or recurrent cancer after initial treatment is difficult and is usually associated with significant perioperative morbidity and mortality.
<INT> However, it provides women with a chance of cure that otherwise may not be possible.
<INT> In carefully selected patients, it may also have a place in palliation of symptoms.
<INT> The biology of recurrent ovarian cancer differs from that of other gynaecological cancers; it is often responsive to chemotherapy and is not included in this review.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2013.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings and reference lists of clinical guidelines and review articles and contacted experts in the field.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> No studies were found; therefore no data were analysed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> However, all were excluded, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria of the review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence to inform decisions about exenterative surgery for women with recurrent cervical, endometrial, vaginal or vulvar malignancies.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform the surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon.
<ABS> This is costly, time consuming, and is of variable effectiveness.
<ABS> Laparoscopic surgery involves use of instruments using key-hole incisions and is generally considered more difficult than open surgery.
<ABS> Training using box models (physical simulation) is an option to supplement standard laparoscopic surgical training.
<ABS> The impact of box model training in surgical trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown.
<ABS> We sought to answer the question of whether the box model training is useful in such trainees in terms of improving technical outcomes by performing a thorough search of the medical literature for randomised clinical trials.
<ABS> Randomised clinical trials are commonly called randomised controlled trials and are the best study design to answer such questions.
<ABS> If conducted well, they provide the most accurate answers to questions about intervention effects.
<ABS> Two authors searched the medical literature available to May 2013 and obtained the information from the identified trials.
<ABS> The use of two authors decreases the errors in obtaining the information.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified and included seven trials in which 249 surgical trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience received either box model training in addition to their standard apprenticeship training (122 trainees) versus standard apprenticeship training alone (127 trainees).
<ABS> The choice of whether the trainees received supplementary box model training was made in a random method similar to the toss of a coin.
<ABS> Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada.
<ABS> After supplementary box model training or standard training, the performance of the trainees was evaluated on their first operation after supplementary box model training and during the first operation in humans after an equivalent time after standard training.
<ABS> Different trials assessed the performance in different operations and all these operations were minor to moderate operations.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> Three trials including 168 trainees reported the complications that the patients developed during or immediately after the operation.
<ABS> There were no deaths in either group in 168 operations performed by 168 trainees and we could not tell whether laparoscopic box model training led to major complications (one major complication in one patient operated by a trainee who underwent standard training out of 86 operations performed by trainees who underwent standard training as compared with no major complications in 82 operations performed by trainees who underwent box model training).
<ABS> None of the trials reported patient quality of life.
<ABS> One trial reported a small reduction in operating time of just over six minutes in the supplementary box model training group.
<ABS> The remaining trials did not report operating time.
<ABS> In one trial, the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery was significantly higher in the supplementary box model training group (24/24 (100%)) compared with the standard training group (15/26 (57.7%)).
<ABS> The remaining trials did not report the proportion of people who stayed overnight.
<ABS> None of the trials reported trainee satisfaction.
<ABS> The operating performance as assessed by surgical experts was significantly better in the supplementary box model training group compared with the standard training group.
<ABS> None of the trials compared box model training compared with animal model training or compared with different methods of box model training.
<ABS> Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with standard surgical training in trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience.
<ABS> It may also decrease operating time and decrease the proportion of patients who require overnight stay in the first hernia repair operation that the trainee performed after box model training.
<ABS> However, the duration of the benefit of box model training (ie, whether such benefit continues in subsequent operations) is unknown.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> Only one trial including 50 trainees was at low risk of bias (no risk of arriving at wrong conclusions because of favouritism by the researchers).
<ABS> Overall, the quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Future research
<ABS> Further well-designed trials with less risk of bias because of poor study design or because of chance are necessary.
<ABS> Such trials should assess the long-term impact of box model training on clinical outcomes.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Surgical training has traditionally been one of apprenticeship, where the surgical trainee learns to perform surgery under the supervision of a trained surgeon.
<INT> This is time consuming, costly, and of variable effectiveness.
<INT> Training using a box model physical simulator is an option to supplement standard training.
<INT> However, the value of this modality on trainees with limited prior laparoscopic experience is unknown.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to May 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We also planned to include trials comparing different methods of box model training.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently identified trials and collected data.
<MaM> We analysed the data with both the fixed-effect and the random-effects models using Review Manager 5.
<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR), mean difference (MD), or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified eight trials that met the inclusion criteria.
<RES> One trial including 17 surgical trainees did not contribute to the meta-analysis.
<RES> We included seven trials (249 surgical trainees belonging to various postgraduate years ranging from year one to four) in which the participants were randomised to supplementary box model training (122 trainees) versus standard training (127 trainees).
<RES> Only one trial (50 trainees) was at low risk of bias.
<RES> The box trainers used in all the seven trials were video trainers.
<RES> Six trials were conducted in USA and one trial in Canada.
<RES> The surgeries in which the final assessments were made included laparoscopic total extraperitoneal hernia repairs, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, laparoscopic tubal ligation, laparoscopic partial salpingectomy, and laparoscopic bilateral mid-segment salpingectomy.
<RES> The final assessments were made on a single operative procedure.
<RES> There were no deaths in three trials (0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 0/86 (0%) standard training; RR not estimable; very low quality evidence).
<RES> The other trials did not report mortality.
<RES> The estimated effect on serious adverse events was compatible with benefit and harm (three trials; 168 patients; 0/82 (0%) supplementary box model training versus 1/86 (1.1%) standard training; RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.02 to 8.43; very low quality evidence).
<RES> None of the trials reported patient quality of life.
<RES> The operating time was significantly shorter in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; MD -6.50 minutes; 95% CI -10.85 to -2.15).
<RES> The proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery was significantly higher in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (1 trial; 50 patients; 24/24 (100%) supplementary box model training versus 15/26 (57.7%) standard training; RR 1.71; 95% CI 1.23 to 2.37).
<RES> None of the trials reported trainee satisfaction.
<RES> The operating performance was significantly better in the supplementary box model training group versus the standard training group (seven trials; 249 trainees; SMD 0.84; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10).
<RES> None of the trials compared box model training versus animal model training or versus different methods of box model training.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is insufficient evidence to determine whether laparoscopic box model training reduces mortality or morbidity.
<CON> There is very low quality evidence that it improves technical skills compared with standard surgical training in trainees with limited previous laparoscopic experience.
<CON> It may also decrease operating time and increase the proportion of patients who were discharged as day-surgery in the first total extraperitoneal hernia repair after box model training.
<CON> However, the duration of the benefit of box model training is unknown.
<CON> Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should assess the long-term impact of box model training on clinical outcomes and compare box training with other forms of training.

<ABS> The use of two review authors to identify studies and obtain information decreases the errors in obtaining the information.
<ABS> We identified and included 25 trials in the review.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The trials compared box model training versus no training (16 trials; 464 participants) or versus different types of box model training (14 trials; 382 participants) (some trials and participants were included in both comparisons as the trials compared different methods of box training versus no training).
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The primary outcomes investigated in this review were time taken to perform task, error score, accuracy score, and a composite (total summed) performance score.
<ABS> Box model training appears to decrease the time required to perform a laparoscopic task, improve the accuracy, decrease the errors, and improves the overall performance.
<ABS> This suggests that the box model training improves technical skills of surgical trainees with no previous experience in laparoscopic surgery.
<ABS> There does not appear to be any significant differences in different methods of box model training.
<ABS> The impact of the improved surgical skills on patients or healthcare funders in terms of improved health or decreased costs is unknown.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All but one of the trials were of high risk of bias (defects in study design that can lead to arriving at incorrect conclusions with overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms).
<ABS> Furthermore, our results are prone to risks of random errors.

<MaM> For each outcome, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Twenty-five trials contributed data to the quantitative synthesis in this review.
<RES> All but one trial were at high risk of bias.
<RES> Overall, 16 trials (464 participants) provided data for meta-analysis of box training (248 participants) versus no supplementary training (216 participants).
<RES> All the 16 trials in this comparison used video trainers.
<RES> Overall, 14 trials (382 participants) provided data for quantitative comparison of different methods of box training.
<RES> There were no trials comparing box model training versus animal model or cadaveric model training.
<RES> Box model training versus no training: The meta-analysis showed that the time taken for task completion was significantly shorter in the box trainer group than the control group (8 trials; 249 participants; SMD -0.48 seconds; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.22).
<RES> Compared with the control group, the box trainer group also had lower error score (3 trials; 69 participants; SMD -0.69; 95% CI -1.21 to -0.17), better accuracy score (3 trials; 73 participants; SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17), and better composite performance scores (SMD 0.65; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88).
<RES> Three trials reported movement distance but could not be meta-analysed as they were not in a format for meta-analysis.
<RES> There was significantly lower movement distance in the box model training compared with no training in one trial, and there were no significant differences in the movement distance between the two groups in the other two trials.
<RES> None of the remaining secondary outcomes such as mortality and morbidity were reported in the trials when animal models were used for assessment of training, error in movements, and trainee satisfaction.
<RES> Different methods of box training: One trial (36 participants) found significantly shorter time taken to complete the task when box training was performed using a simple cardboard box trainer compared with the standard pelvic trainer (SMD -3.79 seconds; 95% CI -4.92 to -2.65).
<RES> One trial (36 participants) found significantly higher composite score with simple cardboard box trainer compared with conventional pelvic trainer (SMD 0.87; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.56).
<RES> There were no significant differences in the composite score between the intervention and control groups in any of the remaining comparisons.
<RES> None of the secondary outcomes were adequately reported in the trials.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The results of this review are threatened by both risks of systematic errors (bias) and risks of random errors (play of chance).
<CON> Laparoscopic box model training appears to improve technical skills compared with no training in trainees with no previous laparoscopic experience.
<CON> The impacts of this decreased time on patients and healthcare funders in terms of improved outcomes or decreased costs are unknown.
<CON> There appears to be no significant differences in the improvement of technical skills between different methods of box model training.
<CON> Further well-designed trials of low risk of bias and random errors are necessary.
<CON> Such trials should assess the impacts of box model training on surgical skills in both the short and long term, as well as clinical outcomes when the trainee becomes competent to operate on patients.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> PLD is an improved formulation of an anticancer drug that has been around since the 1960s.
<ABS> When used with carboplatin (carbo), it has been shown to improve survival in women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) that has come back (relapsed) six months or longer after the last platinum (carbo)-based treatment.
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> We wanted to find out whether PLD was also useful for the treatment of newly diagnosed EOC.
<ABS> We searched the literature from 1990 to January 2013 for relevant studies and included two studies in this review.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> These studies spanned three years and included 820 and 4100 women, respectively.
<ABS> Most women in these studies had advanced cancer and had undergone surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible.
<ABS> Key findings
<ABS> Women receiving the PLD/carbo treatment and those given the standard treatment survived for a similar period, but PLD/carbo caused more women to experience low blood counts (anaemia and low platelets) that often led to a delay in treatment or the need to stop treatment.
<ABS> However, PLD/carbo caused far fewer women to experience hair loss and neuropathy (nerve damage causing symptoms such as tingling, numbness, pain, loss of sensation and/or coordination), and so it might help women who find these side effects unacceptable or intolerable.
<ABS> We concluded that three-weekly PLD/carbo is a reasonable alternative to standard platinum-based treatment for newly diagnosed EOC, but more research is needed to establish the safest and most effective dosage and dose frequency.
<ABS> Adding PLD to standard treatment (PAC/carbo) every six weeks did not help women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer survive longer and was associated with worse effects on blood counts that increased the chance of infection; therefore this triple drug treatment cannot be recommended.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, requiring primary cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy for its first-line management.
<INT> Currently, the recommended standard first-line chemotherapy is platinum-based, usually consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel (PAC/carbo).
<INT> Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is an improved formulation of doxorubicin that is associated with fewer and less severe side effects than are seen with non-modified doxorubicin.
<INT> In combination with carboplatin, PLD has recently been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with PAC/carbo in women with relapsed, platinum-sensitive EOC.
<INT> It is therefore important to know whether any survival benefit can be attributed to PLD when it is used in the first-line setting.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched The Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 1990 to February 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each included trial.
<MaM> We obtained updated trial data when possible.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included two large trials.
<RES> One trial compared three-weekly PLD and carboplatin (PLD/carbo) with PAC/carbo.
<RES> The other trial included four experimental arms, one of which was PLD plus PAC/carbo, that were compared with the standard PAC/carbo regimen.
<RES> We did not combine results of these two trials in the meta-analysis.
<RES> We considered the two studies to be at low risk of bias.
<RES> For the comparison PLD/carbo versus PAC/carbo (820 women; stages Ic to IV), no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 1.19) or overall survival (OS) (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13) were noted between study arms.
<RES> Severe anaemia (risk ratio [RR] 2.74, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.88) and thrombocytopenia (RR 8.09, 95% CI 3.93 to 16.67) were significantly more common with PLD/carbo, whereas alopecia (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) and severe neurotoxicity (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.66) were significantly more common with PAC/carbo.
<RES> Quality of life scores were not significantly different.
<RES> For the comparison PLD/PAC/carbo versus PAC/carbo (1726 women; stage III/IV), it is important to note that PLD was given for alternate cycles only (i.e. every 6 weeks).
<RES> No statistically significant difference in PFS (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09) or OS (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08) between these two treatment arms was reported.
<RES> However, women in the triplet arm experienced significantly more severe haematological adverse events (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia) compared with those given standard treatment.
<RES> No RCTs evaluated single-agent PLD for first-line treatment of EOC.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> PLD/carbo is a reasonable alternative to PAC/carbo for the first-line treatment of EOC.
<CON> No survival benefits appear to be associated with the alternating triplet regimen, and the additional toxicity associated with adding PLD to PAC/carbo limits further investigation.
<CON> Further studies are needed to establish the safest, most effective PLD/carbo regimen for newly diagnosed disease.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, drug-resistant form of epilepsy, for whose treatment stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed for use in combination with other antiepileptic drugs.
<ABS> In this review we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments in the treatment of SMEI.
<ABS> Upon systematically searching (15th May 2013) the medical literature, we found no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing drugs other than STP.
<ABS> We found two RCTs evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of STP in 64 children with SMEI compared with placebo.
<ABS> Compared with patients given placebo, patients receiving STP were more likely to be seizure free or to have 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency.
<ABS> Only one study explicitly reported the occurrence of side effects, which occurred more frequently in patients treated with STP.
<ABS> These data, derived from two small studies, indicate that STP is significantly better than placebo with regards to efficacy but is less well tolerated.
<ABS> Further studies should be conducted to unequivocally establish the long-term efficacy and tolerability of STP in the treatment of SMEI.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (15 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4 of 12, The Cochrane Library, April 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2013) and SCOPUS (1823 to May 2013).
<MaM> The online trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched.
<MaM> The bibliographies of any identified study were searched for further references.
<MaM> We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings.
<MaM> No language restrictions were imposed.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to predefined criteria, extracted relevant data and evaluated the methodological quality of trials.
<MaM> The following outcomes were assessed: at least 50% seizure reduction, seizure freedom, adverse effects, proportion of dropouts and quality of life.
<MaM> Outcomes were assessed using a Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis to calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No RCTs assessing drugs other than STP were found.
<RES> Two RCTs evaluating the use of STP (total of 64 children) were included.
<RES> Both studies were generally at unclear risk of bias.
<RES> No significant difference in the proportion of dropouts was found in the STP group compared with the placebo group (2/33 vs 8/31; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.03).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Adverse effects occurred more frequently with STP.
<CON> Further adequately powered studies with long-term follow-up should be conducted to unequivocally establish the long-term efficacy and tolerability of STP in the treatment of SMEI.

<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chinese herbal medicines for benign thyroid nodules in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules in adults.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A thyroid nodule is a swelling within the thyroid gland and is a common clinical problem detected in 20% to 70% of people.
<ABS> Thyroid nodules can cause pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints.
<ABS> Treatment for benign thyroid nodules includes thyroid hormone therapy, surgery, radioiodine treatment, percutaneous ethanol injection therapy and laser or radiofrequency treatment to shrink nodules.
<ABS> Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used as alternatives to drug treatment.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We could identify only one randomised controlled trial involving 152 participants with benign thyroid nodules.
<ABS> The intervention group (98 participants) was treated with a combination of two Chinese herbal medicines, and no treatment was given to the control group (54 participants).
<ABS> The duration of treatment was three months, and overall follow-up six months.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> The included study did not investigate nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health-related quality of life; all-cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; or socioeconomic effects.
<ABS> Thyroid hormone levels were normal in both groups before and after the study was conducted.
<ABS> No adverse events were reported.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The overall quality of the included study was unclear or low.
<ABS> Currentness of data
<ABS> This evidence is up to date as of April 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> A thyroid nodule is a discrete lesion within the thyroid gland that might be palpable and is ultrasonographically distinct from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma.
<INT> Thyroid nodules are more common as age increases and occur more frequently in women.
<INT> Benign thyroid nodules often cause pressure symptoms and cosmetic complaints.
<INT> In China and many other countries, doctors use Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) to treat thyroid nodules.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules in adults.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included one randomised trial involving 152 participants with a randomisation ratio of 2:1 (CHM vs no treatment).
<RES> The trial applied adequate sequence generation; however, allocation concealment was unclear.
<RES> Duration of treatment was three months, and follow-up six months.
<RES> Our a priori defined outcomes of interest (i.e. nodule volume reduction ≥ 50%; pressure symptoms, cosmetic complaints or both; health-related quality of life; all-cause mortality; cancer occurrence; changes in number and size of thyroid nodules; changes in thyroid volume; and socioeconomic effects) were not investigated in the included study.
<RES> Thyrotropin (TSH), thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) serum levels were normal in both groups before and after the trial was conducted.
<RES> No adverse events were reported (low quality evidence).


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Lifestyle interventions for acute gout

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This summary of a Cochrane review presents what we know from research about the effect of lifestyle modifications in the treatment of people with acute gout.
<ABS> There was one study included in this review, which looked at the benefits and safety of adding topical ice therapy to medications commonly used for treating acute gout (prednisolone and colchicine).
<ABS> Over a one week period, in addition to prednisolone and colchicine, ice was applied to the skin overlying the joints affected by acute gout, for half-an-hour, four times per day, to relieve symptoms of pain and warmth and to reduce signs of redness and swelling.
<ABS> The review shows that in people with acute gout:
<ABS> We are uncertain whether the reduction in pain seen with the addition of topical ice to standard treatment of prednisolone and colchicine, compared to prednisolone and colchicine alone, is a true effect because of the very low quality evidence.
<ABS> Joint function, health-related quality of life, patient global assessment and side effects and complications were not reported.
<ABS> We often do not have precise information about side effects and complications.
<ABS> Topical ice is likely to be a safe intervention.
<ABS> What is gout and what are lifestyle interventions?
<ABS> Gout is a very common cause of painful joint inflammation (arthritis) and is caused by urate crystals forming either within or around joints.
<ABS> The inflammation can lead to pain, redness, warmth and swelling of the affected joints, making the area difficult to touch or move.
<ABS> Some of the reasons why people get gout include their genetic make-up, being overweight, ingesting certain medications (for example cyclosporine), having impaired kidney function, and lifestyle habits such as drinking excessive amounts of alcohol and sugar-sweetened drinks.
<ABS> Medications are the mainstay of acute gout treatment.
<ABS> Given the recognised association between certain lifestyle risk factors and gout development, lifestyle changes such as consuming more water, coffee, dairy milk and cherry juice, and having fewer sugar-sweetened drinks, alcoholic beverages, meat and seafood are commonly recommended to people with chronic gout to prevent recurrence of attacks.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with acute gout using topical ice in addition to medications:
<ABS> Joint pain (lower score means less pain)
<ABS> People who used topical ice (for half-an-hour, four times per day for one week) in addition to medical treatment (oral prednisolone and colchicine) rated their pain 3.33 points lower on a 0 to 10 point pain scale (33% absolute improvement).- People who used topical ice in addition to medical treatment (prednisolone and colchicine) rated their pain to be 2.25 points on a scale of 0 to 10.- People who used medical treatment alone rated their pain to be 5.58 points on a scale of 0 to 10.
<ABS> - Three people would need to be treated with topical ice for one person to benefit from pain relief.
<ABS> Adverse events
<ABS> Side effects or complications of using topical ice in addition to medical therapy were not reported in the study.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies (up to 5 April 2013).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies were included if they were randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials which compared lifestyle interventions to another therapy (active or placebo) in patients with acute gout.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently applied methods recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration for the selection, appraisal, data collection and synthesis of studies.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Only one study (19 participants) at high risk of bias was included in the review.
<RES> Patients were randomised to receive oral prednisolone and colchicine with or without concomitant topical ice therapy.
<RES> Topical ice therapy provided significant additional benefit over oral prednisolone and colchicine alone with respect to pain, but did not significantly reduce swelling during acute gout episodes.
<RES> Mean pain reduction with standard medical treatment was 4.4 cm on a 0 to 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) after one week; the addition of topical ice reduced pain by an additional 3.33 cm (95% CI 5.84 to 0.82), or an absolute reduction of 33% (8% to 58% reduction).
<RES> Joint swelling was reduced by a mean of 3.8 cm in the standard medical treatment group; the addition of topical ice therapy did not reduce swelling significantly (mean difference (MD) 2.07 cm, 95% CI -1.56 to 5.70).
<RES> Target joint function, HRQoL, patient global assessment, study participant withdrawals due to AEs and SEAs were not reported in this study.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Involuntary leakage of urine (urinary incontinence) affects women of all ages, particularly older women who live in residential care such as nursing homes.
<ABS> Some women leak urine during exercise or when they cough or sneeze (stress urinary incontinence) and this may occur as a result of weakness of the pelvic floor muscles such as damage during childbirth.
<ABS> Other women leak urine before going to the toilet when there is a sudden and compelling need to pass urine (urgency urinary incontinence) and this may be caused by involuntary contraction of the bladder muscle.
<ABS> Mixed urinary incontinence is the combination of both stress and urgency urinary incontinence.
<ABS> Pelvic floor muscle training is a supervised treatment and it involves muscle-clenching exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles.
<ABS> It is a common treatment used by women to stop urine leakage.
<ABS> Other treatments are also available which can either be used alone or in combination with pelvic floor muscle training.
<ABS> In this review, the combination of pelvic floor muscle training with another active treatment was compared with the same active treatment alone for the treatment of all types of urine leakage.
<ABS> There was not enough evidence say whether or not the addition of pelvic floor muscle training to another active treatment results in more benefits when compared to the same active treatment alone.
<ABS> There was also insufficient evidence to evaluate the adverse events associated with the addition of PFMT to other active treatment.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a first-line conservative treatment for urinary incontinence in women.
<INT> This systematic review evaluated the effects of adding PFMT to any other active treatment for urinary incontinence in women

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials with two or more arms in women with clinical or urodynamic evidence of stress urinary incontinence, urgency urinary incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence.
<MaM> One arm of the trial included PFMT added to another active treatment; the other arm included the same active treatment alone.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and methodological quality and resolved any disagreement by discussion or consultation with a third party.
<MaM> We extracted and processed data in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
<MaM> Other potential sources of bias we incorporated into the 'Risk of bias' tables were ethical approval, conflict of interest and funding source.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Eleven trials met the eligibility criteria for inclusion, comprising women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), and they compared PFMT added to another active treatment (494 women) with the same active treatment alone (490 women).
<RES> The pre-specified comparisons were reported by single trials except electrical stimulation which was reported by two trials.
<RES> However, the two trials reporting electrical stimulation could not be pooled as one of the trials did not report any relevant data.
<RES> We considered the included trials to be at unclear risk of bias for most of the domains, predominantly due to the lack of adequate information in a number of trials.
<RES> This affected our rating of the quality of evidence.
<RES> The majority of the trials did not report the primary outcomes specified in the review (cure/improvement, quality of life) or measured the outcomes in different ways.
<RES> Effect estimates from small, single trials across a number of comparisons were indeterminate for key outcomes relating to symptoms and we rated the quality of evidence, using the GRADE approach, as either low or very low.
<RES> There was moderate-quality evidence from a single trial investigating women with SUI, UUI or MUI that a higher proportion of women who received a combination of PFMT and heat and steam generating sheet reported cure compared to those who received the sheet alone: 19/37 (51%) versus 8/37 (22%) with a risk ratio (RR) of 2.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 4.73).
<RES> More women reported cure or improvement of incontinence in another trial comparing PFMT added to vaginal cones to vaginal cones alone: 14/15 (93%) versus 14/19 (75%), but this was not statistically significant (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.71).
<RES> We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low.
<RES> Only one trial evaluating PFMT when added to drug therapy provided information about adverse events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.60; very low-quality evidence).
<RES> With regard to condition-specific quality of life, there were no statistically significant differences between women (with SUI, UUI or MUI) who received PFMT added to bladder training and those who received bladder training alone at three months after treatment either on the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Revised scale (mean difference (MD) -5.90, 95% CI -35.53 to 23.73) or on the Urogenital Distress Inventory scale (MD -18.90, 95% CI -37.92 to 0.12).
<RES> A similar pattern of results was observed between women with SUI who received PFMT plus either a continence pessary or duloxetine and those who received the continence pessary or duloxetine alone.
<RES> In all these comparisons, the quality of the evidence for the reported critical outcomes ranged from moderate to very low.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review found insufficient evidence to state whether or not there were additional effects of adding PFMT to other active treatment when compared with the same active treatment alone for urinary incontinence (SUI, UUI or MUI) in women.
<CON> These results should be interpreted with caution as most of the comparisons were investigated in small, single trials.
<CON> None of the trials in this review were large enough to provide reliable evidence.
<CON> Also, none of the included trials reported data on adverse events associated with the PFMT regimen, thereby making it very difficult to evaluate the safety of PFMT.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We reviewed evidence about the effect of immune tolerance induction to remove inhibitors in people with haemophilia A and B.
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Haemophilia A and B are inherited bleeding disorders, where affected people are missing a clotting factor in their blood, which is needed for normal blood clotting.
<ABS> Without this factor, people with haemophilia cannot make proper clots, and they may bleed for a much longer time than normal after an injury, or may experience sudden and unexpected bleeding inside the body and into joints.
<ABS> These bleeding incidents can cause permanent damage to the affected area and can be life threatening.
<ABS> The current treatment for haemophilia is replacement therapy, where the missing clotting factor is injected into the blood.
<ABS> Sometimes, when the missing clotting factor is introduced, the person's immune system will think it is a foreign body, and try to eliminate it with molecules called inhibitors.
<ABS> When a person with haemophilia develops an inhibitor, the injected clotting factor is destroyed before it can stop the bleeding.
<ABS> This is a very serious problem that affects almost one in three people with haemophilia A and approximately one in 30 people with haemophilia B. Immune tolerance induction is a treatment to make the immune system get used to the clotting factor, so that it no longer rejects the factor.
<ABS> This treatment, which involves giving large doses of factor concentrate, is currently used at different doses.
<ABS> We are unsure of how the dosing options work and how safe they are.
<ABS> To discover this, we searched the evidence until July 2013.
<ABS> Trial characteristics
<ABS> We found one randomised trial that compared high- and low-dose immune tolerance induction, which included 115 males with haemophilia A and inhibitors.
<ABS> Key results and conclusions
<ABS> The single included trial was too small to be certain that both doses of immune tolerance induction were equally successful at removing inhibitors.
<ABS> However, the high-dose treatment destroyed all inhibitors faster and with less bleeding events than the low-dose treatment.
<ABS> Since there was only one available trial, further trials are needed to establish the best immune tolerance induction regimen with respect to starting time, dosing intensity and frequency.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Coagulopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books.
<MaM> We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently completed data collection, extraction and assessment of the risk of bias of trials.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> One methodologically sound randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria and was included in the review.
<RES> One further randomised controlled trial has been recently stopped, but it has not yet been reported.
<RES> The included multinational trial randomised 115 paediatric participants with severe haemophilia A and high-responding inhibitors, for whom this was the first attempt at immune tolerance induction, to receive either a low dose (50 IU/kg of factor VIII concentrate three times per week) or a high dose (200 IU/kg of factor VIII daily).
<RES> Although, there was no statistically significant difference in the success of immune tolerance induction between treatment arms, the confidence intervals were too wide to infer no effect: 24 out of 58 participants (46.6%) in the low-dose group and 22 out of 57 (38.6%) in the high-dose group experiencing full tolerance, risk ratio 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68) (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The rate of infection was not statistically different between groups, but again confidence intervals were too wide.
<RES> Of those patients who had a central venous catheter device, 19 out of 47 participants (40.4%) in the low-dose arm had 69 infections, and 22 out of 52 participants (42.3%) in the high-dose arm had 55 infections, risk ratio 0.96 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.53) (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> However, participants in the low-dose immune tolerance induction group experienced significantly more bleeding episodes (50 out of 58 participants (86.2%) experienced one or more bleeding events) than those in the high-dose group (36 out of 57 participants (63.1%) experienced one or more bleeding events), risk ratio 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.71) (low quality evidence).
<RES> One factor VIII reaction, one incidence of trauma and 13 incidences of needing to insert or remove the catheter were reported as trial-related serious adverse events; however, the treatment group where these events occurred was not specified.
<RES> No incidence of nephrotic syndrome was reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We did not find any randomised controlled trial-based comparison of immune tolerance induction with alternate treatment schemes (i.e. bypassing agents for bleeding only).
<CON> In a single randomised trial, there were no significant differences in the immune tolerance induction success rate between different dosing regimens, which may have been due to imprecision of the estimate.
<CON> There is low-quality evidence to suggest that high-dose immune tolerance induction may induce tolerance more quickly which is associated with fewer bleeding complications.
<CON> The choice of immune tolerance induction regimen should be considered individually for each case, until further research provides additional evidence.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> People with schizophrenia often hear voices or see things (hallucinations) and have strange beliefs (delusions).
<ABS> Characteristics of the illness are disordered thoughts, feelings, beliefs and perceptions.
<ABS> People with schizophrenia may also find it difficult to find employment, make friends and socialise with other people.
<ABS> Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) works by focusing on people’s thoughts, emotions and behaviours and by challenging strange or dysfunctional thoughts.
<ABS> CBT was originally developed to help people with psychological disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
<ABS> More recently it has been used to help people with psychosis (CBTp).
<ABS> Working with a therapist, people establish links between their thoughts, feelings or actions.
<ABS> They are encouraged to re-evaluate their beliefs, perceptions and reasoning as well as to monitor their own thoughts, feelings, behaviours and symptoms.
<ABS> CBTp is suggested to provide alternative ways of coping with strange thoughts and the symptoms of schizophrenia, which should reduce distress and improve people’s functioning.
<ABS> Standard CBTp tends to involve around 16 sessions (12 to 20 sessions) over 4 to 6 months, while brief CBTp involves around 6 to 10 sessions, in less than 4 months.
<ABS> The aim of this review was to compare two types of CBTp, brief CBTp and standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia.
<ABS> A search was run for relevant randomised studies in 2013.
<ABS> Only seven potentially-relevant studies were found.
<ABS> However, although all of them randomised people with schizophrenia, none of these studies compared brief CBTp with standard CBTp.
<ABS> In the main they compared brief CBTp with standard care or other therapies.
<ABS> There is, therefore, no information or literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for schizophrenia and psychosis.
<ABS> There is a need for large scale research and trials that compare brief CBTp with standard CBTp.
<ABS> This research needs to evaluate costs, have clear definitions of standard and brief CBTp and focus on the time period or number of sessions, i.e. the ‘effective dose’ of CBTp.
<ABS> This plain language summary has been written by a consumer, Ben Gray, Service User Expert, Rethink Mental Illness.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia is a psychotherapeutic approach that establishes links between thoughts, emotions and behaviours and challenges dysfunctional thoughts.
<INT> There is some evidence to suggest that cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis (CBTp) might be an effective treatment for people with schizophrenia.
<INT> There are however, limitations in its provision due to available resource and training issues.
<INT> One way to tackle this issue might be to offer a brief version of CBTp.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (August 21, 2013) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials.
<MaM> There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register.
<MaM> We inspected all references of the selected articles for further relevant trials.
<MaM> We also contacted experts in the field regarding brief CBTp studies.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No studies could be included.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Currently there is no literature available to compare brief with standard CBTp for people with schizophrenia.
<CON> We cannot, therefore, conclude whether brief CBTp is as effective, less effective or even more effective than standard courses of the same therapy.
<CON> This lack of evidence for brief CBTp has serious implications for research and practice.
<CON> Well planned, conducted and reported randomised trials are indicated.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Unprotected sex can result in disease and death in many areas of the world, due to sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV.
<ABS> The male condom is one of the oldest birth control methods and the earliest method that works to prevent HIV.
<ABS> When used correctly, condoms can provide dual protection against pregnancy and HIV/STI.
<ABS> We examined behavioral programs to improve condom use.
<ABS> Through September 2013, we did computer searches for studies of programs to improve condom use.
<ABS> We wrote to researchers for missing data.
<ABS> The studies could have various designs.
<ABS> The education program addressed preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI.
<ABS> The intervention was compared with a different program, usual care, or no intervention.
<ABS> The studies had a clinical outcome such as pregnancy, HIV, or STI tests.
<ABS> We did not use self-reports of condom use.
<ABS> We found seven randomized trials.
<ABS> Six assigned groups (clusters) and one randomized individuals.
<ABS> Four trials took place in African countries, two in the USA, and one in England.
<ABS> The studies were based in schools, community settings, a clinic, and a military training setting.
<ABS> Five trials examined pregnancy, four studied HIV and HSV-2 (herpes), and three assessed other STI.
<ABS> We found no major differences between study groups for pregnancy or HIV.
<ABS> Some results were seen for STI outcomes.
<ABS> Two studies showed fewer HSV-2 cases with the behavioral program compared to the control group.
<ABS> One also reported fewer cases of syphilis and gonorrhea with the behavioral program plus STI management.
<ABS> Another study reported a higher gonorrhea rate for the intervention group.
<ABS> The researchers believed the result was due to a subgroup that did not have the full program.
<ABS> We found little clinical effect of improving condom use.
<ABS> The studies provided moderate to low quality information.
<ABS> Losses to follow up were high.
<ABS> We need good programs on condom use to prevent pregnancy and HIV/STI.
<ABS> Programs should be useful for settings with few resources.
<ABS> Interventions should be tested with valid outcome measures.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Unprotected sex is a major risk factor for disease, disability, and mortality in many areas of the world due to the prevalence and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV.
<INT> The male condom is one of the oldest contraceptive methods and the earliest method for preventing the spread of HIV.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We examined comparative studies of behavioral interventions for improving condom use.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We wrote to investigators for missing data.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies could be either randomized or nonrandomized.
<MaM> They examined a behavioral intervention for improving condom use.
<MaM> The comparison could be another behavioral intervention, usual care, or no intervention.
<MaM> The experimental intervention had an educational or counseling component to encourage or improve condom use.
<MaM> It addressed preventing pregnancy as well as the transmission of HIV/STI.
<MaM> The focus could be on male or female condoms and targeted to individuals, couples, or communities.
<MaM> Potential participants included heterosexual women and heterosexual men.
<MaM> Studies had to provide data from test results or records on a biological outcome: pregnancy, HIV/STI, or presence of semen as assessed with a biological marker, e.g., prostate-specific antigen.
<MaM> We did not include self-reported data on protected or unprotected sex, due to the limitations of recall and social desirability bias.
<MaM> Outcomes were measured at least three months after the behavioral intervention started.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors evaluated abstracts for eligibility and extracted data from included studies.
<MaM> For the dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> Cluster randomized trials used various methods of accounting for the clustering, such as multilevel modeling.
<MaM> Most reports did not provide information to calculate the effective sample size.
<MaM> Therefore, we presented the results as reported by the investigators.
<MaM> No meta-analysis was conducted due to differences in interventions and outcome measures.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Seven studies met our eligibility criteria.
<RES> All were randomized controlled trials; six assigned clusters and one randomized individuals.
<RES> Sample sizes for the cluster-randomized trials ranged from 2157 to 15,614; the number of clusters ranged from 18 to 70.
<RES> Four trials took place in African countries, two in the USA, and one in England.
<RES> Three were based mainly in schools, two were in community settings, one took place during military training, and one was clinic-based.
<RES> Five studies provided data on pregnancy, either from pregnancy tests or national records of abortions and live births.
<RES> Four trials assessed the incidence or prevalence of HIV and HSV-2.
<RES> Three trials examined other STI.
<RES> The trials showed or reported no significant difference between study groups for pregnancy or HIV, but favorable effects were evident for some STI.
<RES> Two showed a lower incidence of HSV-2 for the behavioral-intervention group compared to the usual-care group, with reported adjusted rate ratios (ARR) of 0.65 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.97) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.97), while HIV did not differ significantly.
<RES> One also reported lower syphilis incidence and gonorrhea prevalence for the behavioral intervention plus STI management compared to the usual-care group.
<RES> The reported ARR were 0.58 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.96) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.70), respectively.
<RES> Another study reported a negative effect on gonorrhea for young women in the intervention group versus the control group (ARR 1.93; 95% CI 1.01 to 3.71).
<RES> The difference occurred among those with only one year of the intervention.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found few studies and little clinical evidence of effectiveness for interventions promoting condom use for dual protection.
<CON> We did not find favorable results for pregnancy or HIV, and only found some for other STI.
<CON> The overall quality of evidence was moderate to low; losses to follow up were high.
<CON> Effective interventions for improving condom use are needed to prevent pregnancy and HIV/STI transmission.
<CON> Interventions should be feasible for resource-limited settings and tested using valid and reliable outcome measures.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV infection

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Micronutrient supplementation for children with HIV infection

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review includes 11 trials that tested the effectiveness and safety of various micronutrient supplements in children with HIV infection in a diversity of settings.
<ABS> All except one trial were conducted in African children.
<ABS> The primary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, and HIV-related hospitalisations, and secondary outcomes were HIV disease progession, measures of growth, and adverse effects of supplementation.
<ABS> The review found that vitamin A supplements are beneficial and safe, and halved mortality overall in an analysis of three trials in different African countries.
<ABS> Zinc appeared to be safe and reduced diarhoeal morbidity in one trial.
<ABS> Multiple micronutrient supplements reduced the duration of hospital admissions, and improved appetite and short-term growth in poorly nourished hospitalised children.
<ABS> Further research is needed on single supplements other than vitamin A, and on the long-term effects, optimal composition and dosing of multiple supplements.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread and compound the effects of HIV disease in children, especially in poor communities.
<INT> Micronutrient supplements may be effective and safe in reducing the burden of HIV disease.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Indicators of HIV disease progession, anthropometric measures, and any adverse effects of supplementation were secondary outcomes.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two reviewers independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias using standardised criteria, and extracted data.
<MaM> Review Manager 5.1 was used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data and the weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous data, and to perform random effects meta-analysis where appropriate.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three new studies in addition to the eight studies in the earlier version of the review (Irlam 2010).
<RES> Eleven studies with a total of 2412 participants were therefore included: five trials of vitamin A, one trial of vitamin D, two trials of zinc, and three trials of multiple micronutrient supplements.
<RES> All except one trial were conducted in African children.
<RES> Vitamin A halved all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis of three trials in African children, had inconsistent impacts on diarrhoeal and respiratory morbidity, and improved short-term growth in a Tanzanian trial.
<RES> No significant adverse effects were reported.
<RES> A single small trial of vitamin D in North American adolescents and children demonstrated safety but no clinical benefits.
<RES> Zinc supplements reduced diarrhoeal morbidity and had no adverse effects on disease progression in one small South African trial.
<RES> Another trial in South African children with and without HIV infection did not show benefit from the the prophylactic use of zinc or multiple supplements versus vitamin A in the small subgroup of children with HIV infection.
<RES> Multiple micronutrient supplements at twice the RDA did not alter mortality, growth, or CD4 counts at 12 months in Ugandan children aged one to five years.
<RES> Short-term supplementation until hospital discharge significantly reduced the duration of all hospital admissions in poorly nourished South African children, and supplementation for six months after discharge improved appetite and nutritional indicators.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Vitamin A supplementation is beneficial and safe in children with HIV infection.
<CON> Zinc is safe and appears to have similar benefits on diarrhoeal morbidity in children with HIV as in children without HIV infection.
<CON> Multiple micronutrient supplements have some clinical benefit in poorly nourished children with HIV infection.
<CON> Further trials of single supplements (vitamin D, zinc, and selenium) are required to build the evidence base.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced endometrial cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Chemotherapy after surgery for stage III and IV endometrial cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> The issue: Advanced endometrial cancer (FIGO stage III and IV) is cancer of the womb which has spread beyond the womb to the ovaries, vagina, other adjacent tissues, draining lymph nodes, or other organs.
<ABS> Women are usually treated by surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible.
<ABS> They are then offered adjuvant (meaning 'added') radiotherapy (high energy x-rays and other rays that destroy cancer cells), or chemotherapy (anti-cancer drugs), or both.
<ABS> There is uncertainty as to which treatment (radio- or chemotherapy or both) after surgery has the greatest effect on survival, and which anti-cancer drugs work best.
<ABS> The aim of the review: We aimed to determine whether chemotherapy after surgery is effective compared to radiotherapy, in women with advanced cancer of the womb.
<ABS> How was the review conducted?
<ABS> We searched the literature from 1966 to November 2013 for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
<ABS> We included four RCTs which were at low to moderate risk of bias and involved 1269 women.
<ABS> We wrote to the investigators of three trials for unpublished data.
<ABS> Three of the four trials compared similar interventions (chemotherapy versus radiotherapy after surgery).
<ABS> We pooled survival data (including the unpublished data) from two trials and await unpublished data for the third trial.
<ABS> The fourth trial compared two types of chemotherapy treatments after all women had received surgery and radiotherapy.
<ABS> What are the main findings?
<ABS> Women who received chemotherapy after surgery (starting within eight weeks of surgery) survived approximately 25% longer than those receiving radiotherapy after surgery.
<ABS> Assuming that 60% of women with stage III endometrial cancer usually survive at least five years after surgery and radiotherapy, this would increase to 75% if they receive surgery and chemotherapy instead, depending on other risk factors, such as age.
<ABS> The risk of death which might have been caused by treatment was low with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy but we could not be sure if one was more harmful than the other.
<ABS> Chemotherapy may be associated with more side-effects (low blood counts, nerve damage and hair loss) compared with radiotherapy.
<ABS> In the trial that compared two different chemotherapy treatments, there was no clear evidence that using three anti-cancer drugs was better than using two.
<ABS> However, the final overall survival results of this trial have not yet been reported.
<ABS> Severe side-effects were much more common in women treated with three anti-cancer drugs than two drugs.
<ABS> What are the conclusions?
<ABS> Chemotherapy appears to be more effective than radiotherapy after surgery for women with stage III and IV endometrial cancer but may cause more side-effects.
<ABS> More research is needed to determine whether the addition of radiotherapy to chemotherapy improves outcomes and which anti-cancer drugs are best.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Approximately 13% of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer present with advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III/IV).
<INT> The standard treatment of advanced endometrial cancer consists of cytoreductive surgery followed by radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, or both.
<INT> There is currently little agreement about which adjuvant treatment is the safest and most effective.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Also we searched electronic clinical trial registries for ongoing trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trials for risk of bias.
<MaM> Where necessary, we contacted trial investigators for relevant, unpublished data.
<MaM> We pooled data using the random-effects model in Review Manager (RevMan) software.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included four multicentre RCTs involving 1269 women with primary FIGO stage III/IV endometrial cancer.
<RES> We considered the trials to be at low to moderate risk of bias.
<RES> All participants received primary cytoreductive surgery.
<RES> Two trials, evaluating 620 women (83% stage III, 17% stage IV), compared adjuvant chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy; one trial evaluating 552 women (88% stage III, 12% stage IV) compared two chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin/doxorubicin/paclitaxel (CDP) versus cisplatin/doxorubicin (CD) treatment) in women who had all undergone adjuvant radiotherapy; and one trial contributed no data.
<RES> Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant radiotherapy (OS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.99, I² = 22%; and PFS: HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92, I² = 0%).
<RES> Sensitivity analysis using adjusted and unadjusted OS data, gave similar results.
<RES> In subgroup analyses, the effects on survival in favour of chemotherapy were not different for stage III and IV, or stage IIIA and IIIC (tests for subgroup differences were not significant and I² = 0%).
<RES> This evidence was of moderate quality.
<RES> Data from one trial showed that women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to experience haematological and neurological adverse events and alopecia, and more likely to discontinue treatment (33/194 versus 6/202; RR 5.73, 95% CI 2.45 to 13.36), than those receiving adjuvant radiotherapy.
<RES> There was no statistically significant difference in treatment-related deaths between the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment arms (8/309 versus 5/311; Risk Ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 5.00).
<RES> There was no clear difference in PFS between intervention groups in the one trial that compared CDP versus CD (552 women; HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.17).
<RES> We considered this evidence to be of moderate quality.
<RES> Mature OS data from this trial were not yet available.
<RES> Severe haematological and neurological adverse events occurred more frequently with CDP than CD.
<RES> We found no trials to include of adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation in advanced endometrial cancer; however we identified one ongoing trial of this comparison.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate quality evidence that chemotherapy increases survival time after primary surgery by approximately 25% relative to radiotherapy in stage III and IV endometrial cancer.
<CON> There is limited evidence that it is associated with more adverse effects.
<CON> There is some uncertainty as to whether triplet regimens offer similar survival benefits over doublet regimens in the long-term.
<CON> Further research is needed to determine which chemotherapy regimen(s) are the most effective and least toxic, and whether the addition of radiotherapy further improves outcomes.
<CON> A large trial evaluating the benefits and risks of adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy in advanced endometrial cancer is ongoing.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Many cancerous and non-cancerous growths that develop in the liver are treated by removing part of the liver (elective liver resection), which is major surgery with high risk of complications.
<ABS> Severe blood loss is a contributing factor to the complications since blood vessels are cut and blood entering the liver from the general circulation escapes during liver resection.
<ABS> Several methods have been proposed to decrease blood loss during liver resection.
<ABS> This includes blocking the blood supply to the liver during the operation, a process known as vascular occlusion, which could be performed continuously or intermittently.
<ABS> Special equipment using ultrasound waves and high-frequency alternating current called radiofrequency waves have been proposed as alternatives to using simple surgical instruments in the division of the liver.
<ABS> Once the liver is divided, care is taken to ensure that there is no bleeding from the cut surface of the liver remaining in the body.
<ABS> This can be done by simply using the heat generated by standard alternating current (diathermy machine or electrocautery) or additional glue can be applied to the cut surface to prevent and control bleeding.
<ABS> However, the benefits that these special methods offer in liver resection are unknown.
<ABS> A surgeon typically uses one method from each of these three categories, that is, vascular occlusion (including no vascular occlusion), the use of special equipment to divide the liver, and the way that the cut surface is managed.
<ABS> Together, one can consider this combination of methods as a treatment strategy.
<ABS> The optimal treatment strategy for liver resection is unknown.
<ABS> We sought to clarify this information by performing a literature search to seek the differences in death, complications, quality of life, blood loss and blood transfusion requirements, length of hospital stay, intensive therapy unit stay, and time taken to return to work between the different treatment strategies.
<ABS> We used special statistical methods to compare the different treatments simultaneously as compared to the traditional Cochrane method of comparing two treatments at a time since there are multiple treatment strategies.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We identified nine trials with 617 participants that met our inclusion criteria.
<ABS> However, we were only able to include 496 participants randomised to seven different treatment strategies from seven trials in our network meta-analysis because of the complex statistical methodology that we used.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> There was an increase in the proportion of people with major complications when the liver was divided using radiofrequency as compared with using standard surgical instruments.
<ABS> Major complications developed in approximately 25% of people undergoing liver resection using radiofrequency.
<ABS> In comparison, one in 15 people (7%) undergoing liver resection by standard method developed major complications.
<ABS> There was modest reduction in blood loss and number of units of blood transfused when continuous vascular occlusion was used compared with no vascular occlusion or intermittent vascular occlusion.
<ABS> Liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion took about 50 minutes longer than liver resection performed with no vascular occlusion when the liver was divided using ultrasound.
<ABS> Quality of life and time needed to return to work were not reported in any of the trials.
<ABS> The differences in the other outcomes and other comparisons that were not mentioned above were imprecise.
<ABS> Quality of evidence
<ABS> All the trials were at high risk of bias, that is, there is possibility of arriving at wrong conclusions overestimating benefits or underestimating harms of one method or the other because of the way that the studies were conducted.
<ABS> The overall quality of evidence was very low.
<ABS> Conclusions
<ABS> We are unable to determine the comparative benefits and harms of different methods of liver resection.
<ABS> Liver resection using radiofrequency energy should be further assessed in randomised clinical trials in order to understand its safety profile better.
<ABS> The risk of serious adverse events following liver resection using no special equipment compared with more complex methods requiring special equipment is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence.
<ABS> However, there is considerable uncertainty about this and large benefits or harms with a specific method of liver resection cannot be ruled out.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Liver resection is a major surgery with significant mortality and morbidity.
<INT> Various methods have been attempted to decrease blood loss and morbidity during elective liver resection.
<INT> These methods include different methods of vascular occlusion, parenchymal transection, and management of the cut surface of the liver.
<INT> A surgeon typically uses only one of the methods from each of these three categories.
<INT> Together, one can consider this combination as a treatment strategy.
<INT> The optimal treatment strategy for liver resection is unknown.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to July 2012 to identify randomised clinical trials.
<MaM> We also handsearched the references lists of identified trials.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors identified trials and collected data independently.
<MaM> We assessed the risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's methodology.
<MaM> We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method in WinBUGS 1.4 following the guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance documents.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified nine trials with 617 participants that met our inclusion criteria.
<RES> Interventions in the trials included three different options for vascular occlusion, four for parenchymal transection, and two for management of the cut liver surface.
<RES> These interventions were combined in different ways in the trials giving 11 different treatment strategies.
<RES> However, we were only able to include 496 participants randomised to seven different treatment strategies from seven trials in our network meta-analysis, because the treatment strategies from the trials that used fibrin sealant for management of the raw liver surface could not be connected to the network for any outcomes.
<RES> Thus, the trials included in the network meta-analysis varied only in their approaches to vascular exclusion and parenchymal transection and none used fibrin sealant.
<RES> All the trials were of high risk of bias and the quality of evidence was very low for all the outcomes.
<RES> The differences in mortality between the different strategies was imprecise (seven trials; seven treatment strategies; 496 participants).
<RES> Five trials (six strategies; 406 participants) reported serious adverse events.
<RES> There was an increase in the proportion of people with serious adverse events when surgery was performed using radiofrequency dissecting sealer compared with the standard clamp-crush method in the absence of vascular occlusion and fibrin sealant.
<RES> The OR for the difference in proportion was 7.13 (95% CrI 1.77 to 28.65; 15/49 (adjusted proportion 24.9%) in radiofrequency dissecting sealer group compared with 6/89 (6.7%) in the clamp-crush method).
<RES> The differences in serious adverse events between the other groups were imprecise.
<RES> There was a high probability that 'no vascular occlusion with clamp-crush method and no fibrin' and 'intermittent vascular occlusion with Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator and no fibrin' are better than other treatments with regards to serious adverse events.
<RES> Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials.
<RES> The differences in the proportion of people requiring blood transfusion was imprecise (six trials; seven treatments; 446 participants).
<RES> Two trials (three treatments; 155 participants) provided data for quantity of blood transfused.
<RES> People undergoing liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion had higher amounts of blood transfused than people with continuous vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with the clamp-crush method and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD 1.2 units; 95% CrI 0.08 to 2.32).
<RES> The differences in the other comparisons were imprecise (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Three trials (four treatments; 281 participants) provided data for operative blood loss.
<RES> People undergoing liver resection using continuous vascular occlusion had lower blood loss than people with no vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with clamp-crush method and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD -130.9 mL; 95% CrI -255.9 to -5.9).
<RES> None of the trials reported the proportion of people with major blood loss.
<RES> The differences in the length of hospital stay (six trials; seven treatments; 446 participants) and intensive therapy unit stay (four trials; six treatments; 261 participants) were imprecise.
<RES> Four trials (four treatments; 245 participants) provided data for operating time.
<RES> Liver resection by intermittent vascular occlusion took longer than liver resection performed with no vascular occlusion when the parenchymal transection was carried out with Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator and no fibrin sealant was used for the cut surface (MD 49.6 minutes; 95% CrI 29.8 to 69.4).
<RES> The differences in the operating time between the other comparisons were imprecise.
<RES> None of the trials reported the time needed to return to work.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Very low quality evidence suggested that liver resection using a radiofrequency dissecting sealer without vascular occlusion or fibrin sealant may increase serious adverse events and this should be evaluated in further randomised clinical trials.
<CON> The risk of serious adverse events with liver resection using no special equipment compared with more complex methods requiring special equipment was uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence.


<H1> TITLE
<H1> Oxycodone for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Oxycodone for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Neuropathic pain is pain coming from damaged nerves.
<ABS> It differs from pain messages carried along healthy nerves from damaged tissue (as in a fall, a cut, or an arthritic knee).
<ABS> Neuropathic pain is treated by different medicines than pain from damaged tissue.
<ABS> Medicines such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are not effective in neuropathic pain, while medicines that are sometimes used to treat epilepsy or depression can be very effective in some people with neuropathic pain.
<ABS> Our understanding of fibromyalgia (a condition of persistent, widespread pain and tenderness, sleep problems, and fatigue) is poor, but fibromyalgia can respond to the same medicines as neuropathic pain.
<ABS> Oxycodone is used to treat acute and some forms of chronic pain, and so might be a useful medicine for neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.
<ABS> In 2013 we performed searches to look for clinical trials in which oxycodone was used to treat neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.
<ABS> We found three studies of modest quality that tested oxycodone against placebo for several weeks.
<ABS> Almost all of the 254 people in the studies had painful limbs because of damaged nerves caused by diabetes.
<ABS> Oxycodone was not convincingly shown to help relieve the pain (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Compared with placebo, fewer people stopped taking oxycodone because they felt it was not effective, but more people experienced adverse effects (very low quality evidence).
<ABS> Oxycodone has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia.
<ABS> No studies have examined its use in other types of neuropathic pain, or in fibromyalgia.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This review is one of a series on drugs used to treat neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.
<INT> These conditions are estimated to affect 3 to 10% of adults, and are difficult to treat.
<INT> Although they probably have different aetiologies, neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia can respond to the same therapies.
<INT> There have been substantial changes in the standards of evidence considered necessary for assessment of interventions to treat chronic pain, to provide data that are more robust and clinically relevant.
<INT> Oxycodone is a strong opioid agonist widely used to manage severe pain; this review assesses evidence for oxycodone using current standards of evidence designed to reduce bias.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of oxycodone for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> On 6 November 2013, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality, and assessed risk of bias.
<MaM> We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included three studies with 254 participants; 204 had painful diabetic neuropathy and 50 postherpetic neuralgia.
<RES> Study size ranged from 45 to 159 participants.
<RES> Two studies used a cross-over design and one a parallel group design; study duration was four or six weeks.
<RES> Controlled release oxycodone (oxycodone CR) was used in all three studies, with doses titrated up to a maximum of between 60 and 120 mg daily; mean doses achieved ranged between 37 and 45 mg daily.
<RES> All studies used a placebo comparator, although in one study, an active placebo (benztropine) was used.
<RES> All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias.
<RES> No study reported the proportion of participants experiencing at least 50% pain relief or who were very much improved, while one reported the proportion with at least 30% pain relief, two reported at least moderate pain relief, and one reported the number of participants who considered treatment to be moderately effective.
<RES> No study provided first or second tier evidence for an efficacy outcome.
<RES> Third tier evidence indicated greater pain intensity reduction and better patient satisfaction with oxycodone than with placebo in all three studies, but such evidence was derived mainly from group mean data, with last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation or completer analysis, in small studies lasting less than eight weeks (very low quality evidence).
<RES> Adverse events were more common with oxycodone CR than with placebo.
<RES> At least one adverse event was experienced by 86% of participants taking oxycodone CR and 63% taking placebo, and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful effect (NNH) was 4.3.
<RES> The effect of oxycodone on serious adverse events reported was uncertain in comparison with placebo (oxycodone 3.4% versus placebo: 7.0%; RR 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.23; very low quality evidence); one death was reported with oxycodone CR, but was not attributed to treatment.
<RES> Adverse event withdrawals did not differ significantly between groups, occurring in 11% of participants with oxycodone CR and 6.4% with placebo (RR 1.69 (0.83 to 3.43); very low quality evidence).
<RES> Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were less frequent with oxycodone CR (1.1%) than placebo (11%), with an NNT to prevent one withdrawal of 10 (RR 0.12 (0.03 to 0.45); very low quality evidence).
<RES> We found no relevant studies in chronic neuropathic pain conditions other than painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia, or in fibromyalgia.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No convincing, unbiased evidence suggests that oxycodone (as oxycodone CR) is of value in treating people with painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia.
<CON> There is no evidence at all for other neuropathic pain conditions, or for fibromyalgia.
<CON> Adverse events typical of opioids appear to be common.


<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Blood thinners for pulmonary hypertension

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> The heart has four chambers: two upper and two lower chambers.
<ABS> The lower right chamber, also known as the right ventricle, pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where the blood receives oxygen.
<ABS> Pulmonary hypertension occurs when pressure in the pulmonary arteries is increased to above normal (8 to 25 mmHg).
<ABS> When this happens over time, inflammation of the pulmonary artery occurs.
<ABS> The arteries may then become stiff and tighten.
<ABS> These changes make it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the lungs.
<ABS> The heart becomes weaker as it tries to push against this pressure; the resulting disturbance to blood flow can lead to blood clots.
<ABS> These clots can travel to the lungs, which can worsen the person's condition and may result in death.
<ABS> People with pulmonary hypertension may complain of tiredness, chest pain and shortness of breath during normal activities like walking and running, which may progress to affect all physical activities.
<ABS> Prospects of survival depend on several factors, but pregnancy is strongly associated with poor survival.
<ABS> Treatment of this disease is multi-faceted and includes rehabilitation, psychosocial support and surgical and medical treatment.
<ABS> Medical treatment includes the use of blood thinners such as warfarin, heparin, fondaparinux, argatroban, dabigatran, apixaban and rivaroxaban.
<ABS> Blood thinners work by preventing the formation of clot.
<ABS> The blood thinner of choice, warfarin, needs close monitoring with daily to weekly laboratory testing to maintain the therapeutic target; this monitoring may be difficult to keep up with.
<ABS> The major side effect of blood thinners is bleeding, which can manifest as easy bruising, bleeding in the digestive tract and bleeding into the brain; severe cases can be fatal.
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of blood thinners in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
<ABS> No eligible studies (randomised controlled trials) were found.
<ABS> Review of other studies (non-randomised controlled trials) shows the effectiveness of this intervention.
<ABS> However, these findings should be interpreted with caution because of the low quality of evidence provided by these studies.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> No randomised evidence is available.
<ABS> We decided to look at the results of other studies (non-randomised control trials).
<ABS> They provide only poor quality evidence of effectiveness of this intervention, and the results should be interpreted with caution.
<ABS> We are uncertain as to how far the results of studies with this design can be believed, and our own approach was not designed to properly look for them and incorporate them in our systematic review.
<ABS> This review therefore highlights the need for appropriately designed randomised controlled trials.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Elevation of pulmonary pressure is no longer a rare disease, given its multifactorial etiology.
<INT> However data on the actual incidence of this condition are still limited, and controversies regarding its management are ongoing.
<INT> Use of anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension is based on the presence of in situ thrombosis in the patient with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and on retrospective evidence of clinical benefit.
<INT> Current practice is dependent mostly on expert opinion and individualised experience.
<INT> The real benefit of its use in different types of pulmonary hypertension is still debatable, and the therapeutic target of the international normalised ratio (INR) among treated patients remains inconclusive.
<INT> Adverse outcomes associated with anticoagulants are significant and can include fatal haemorrhage.
<INT> Justification for the use of this intervention requires critical evaluation of randomised controlled trials.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> To evaluate the effectiveness of, and potential adverse events associated with, anticoagulation in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH).
<OBJ> 2.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified trials through searches of the following databases.
<MaM> Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid); EMBASE (Ovid); CINAHL (EBSCOhost); Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal.
<MaM> The trial search date was 28 March 2014.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We planned to include only randomised controlled trials.
<MaM> Participants with PH with co-morbidities including medical conditions requiring long-term anticoagulation were to be included.
<MaM> We also planned to include trials comparing any anticoagulant with placebo.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> IE and HE independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified potential studies for inclusion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No eligible trials were identified for inclusion in this review.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> No eligible studies were identified for inclusion in this review.
<CON> So that better decisions can be made regarding the effectiveness of this intervention, well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Review question
<ABS> We considered in this review whether vitamins C and E, when taken together daily, may be helpful for people with asthma or exercise-induced breathlessness.
<ABS> The condition affects quality of life.
<ABS> It is estimated that more than 300 million people suffer from asthma, and vitamins C and E have been suggested as supplements that might help to reduce symptoms.
<ABS> Four studies included adults, and one included children.
<ABS> The very limited number of studies available for review and their different designs meant that we were only able to describe individual studies, rather than pooling their results to determine an average result.
<ABS> In most study reports, the design was not well described; therefore it was impossible to assess the risk of bias for most of the studies.
<ABS> In terms of our key outcomes, very few relevant data were provided by the trial authors.
<ABS> However, at this stage, it is not possible to form any clear conclusions based on these findings, as available evidence is insufficient to allow proper assessment of the use of vitamins C and E as treatment for patients with asthma.
<ABS> Additional well-designed research is required to answer this question.
<ABS> This may mean that the studies were not well randomised, which can affect the results.
<ABS> A second concern is that the designs of the studies were different, which means that we cannot be certain that the studies were measuring the same thing.
<ABS> By taking this into account, we judged the evidence in this review overall to be of low to moderate quality.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The association between dietary antioxidants and asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is not fully understood.
<INT> Vitamin C and vitamin E are natural antioxidants that are predominantly present in fruits and vegetables; inadequate vitamin E intake is associated with airway inflammation.
<INT> It has been postulated that the combination may be more beneficial than either single antioxidant for people with asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of supplementation of vitamins C and E versus placebo (or no vitamin C and E supplementation) on exacerbations and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in adults and children with chronic asthma.
<OBJ> To also examine the potential effects of vitamins C and E on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in people with asthma and in people without a diagnosis of asthma who experience symptoms only on exercise.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> Searches were conducted in September 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised controlled trials of adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma.
<MaM> We separately considered trials in which participants had received a diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (or exercise-induced asthma).
<MaM> Trials comparing vitamin C and E supplementation versus placebo were included.
<MaM> We included trials in which asthma management for treatment and control groups included similar background therapy.
<MaM> Short-term use of vitamins C and E at the time of exacerbation or for cold symptoms in people with asthma is outside the scope of this review.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methods as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> It was not possible to aggregate the five included studies (214 participants).
<RES> Four studies (206 participants) addressed the question of whether differences in outcomes were seen when vitamin C and E supplementation versus placebo was provided for participants with asthma, and only one of those studies (160 children) included a paediatric population; the remaining three studies included a combined total of just 46 adults.
<RES> An additional study considered the question of whether differences in outcomes were noted when vitamin C and E supplementation was compared with placebo for exercise-induced asthma; this trial included only eight participants.
<RES> The randomisation process of the trials were unclear leading us to downgrade the quality of the evidence.
<RES> Four of the studies were double blind while the other study was single blind.
<RES> None of these studies provided data on our two prespecified primary outcome measures: exacerbations and HRQL.
<RES> Lung function data obtained from the studies were inconclusive.
<RES> The only studies that provided any suggestion of an effect, and only with some outcomes, were the paediatric study, especially for children with moderate to severe asthma, and the small study on exercise-induced asthma.
<RES> Even so, this evidence was judged to be at moderate/low quality.
<RES> Only one study contributed data on asthma symptoms and adverse events, reporting no evidence of an effect of the intervention for symptoms and that one participant in the treatment group dropped out due to cystitis.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> It is not possible to draw firm conclusions from this review with respect to the comparison of vitamin C and E supplementation versus placebo in the management of asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
<CON> We found only one study relevant to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction; most included participants came from studies designed to assess the effect of vitamin supplementation on the impact of atmospheric pollutants (such as ozone).
<CON> Evidence is lacking on the comparison of vitamin C and E supplementation versus placebo for asthma with respect to outcomes such as HRQL and exacerbations, which were not addressed by any of the included studies.
<CON> When compared with lung function tests alone, HRQL scores and exacerbation frequency are better indicators of the severity of asthma, its impact on daily activities and its response to treatment in a patient population.
<CON> These end points are well recognised in good quality studies of asthma management.

<H1> Anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Researchers in The Cochrane Collaboration conducted a review of research about the effects of anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) on fibromyalgia (FM).
<ABS> After searching for all relevant studies, they found eight studies with up to 3579 people.
<ABS> The anticonvulsants that they studied were gabapentin, lacosamide, levetiracetam and pregabalin.
<ABS> They found reliable conclusions for pregabalin only.
<ABS> Key results: pregabalin compared with fake medication after an average of 13 weeks
<ABS> - Pregabalin slightly reduces pain and sleep problems.- Pregabalin slightly reduces fatigue.- Pregabalin increases medication side effects, in particular dizziness.- Pregabalin does not differ from fake medication in serious side effects.
<ABS> Possible side effects may include drowsiness, weight gain, swelling in the legs, blurred vision and co-ordination problems.
<ABS> Rare complications may include angio-oedema (swelling that happens just below the surface of the skin, most often around the lips and eyes), allergies and diseases of the immune system, worsening of heart failure, impairment of a person's ability to drive or operate machinery, and abuse or dependency on pregabalin.
<ABS> Serious side effects, such as suicidal thoughts, are very rare.
<ABS> What is FM and what are anticonvulsants?
<ABS> People with FM suffer from chronic widespread pain, sleep problems and fatigue.
<ABS> There is no cure for FM at present.
<ABS> Treatments aim at relieving the symptoms and improving quality of life.
<ABS> Anticonvulsants are medications which help people with epileptic seizures.
<ABS> Neurons are cells that send messages to the brain.
<ABS> For example some neurons send messages about light, sound or touch to the brain.
<ABS> If something goes wrong and the neurons send too many messages quickly, then people may feel pain more strongly.
<ABS> Anticonvulsants can help slow the neurons down in the spinal cord and the brain.
<ABS> Some anticonvulsants can reduce pain and sleep problems in chronic pain due to nerve damage and can stabilize mood in people with anxiety and depressive disorders.
<ABS> People with fibromyalgia can have more brain activity and stronger reactions to the stimulus from their senses, so anticonvulsants might help with that.
<ABS> Pregabalin is approved for use in FM patients in most countries of North and South America and Asia, but not in Europe.
<ABS> Best estimate of what happens to people with FM when they take pregabalin
<ABS> Pain:
<ABS> - 9 more people out of 100 who took pregabalin reached 50% or greater pain reduction than people who took fake medication (9% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 23 out of 100 people had their pain reduced by 50% or greater when they took pregabalin compared with 14 out of 100 people when they took a fake medication.
<ABS> Global improvement:
<ABS> - 11 more people out of 100 who took pregabalin improved 'much' and 'very much' globally than people who took fake medication (12% absolute improvement).
<ABS> - 39 out of 100 people improved 'much' and 'very much' globally when they took pregabalin compared with 28 out of 100 people when they took a fake medication.
<ABS> Fatigue (measured on a 1 to 50 scale):
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin reported a slight reduction of fatigue (2.7% absolute improvement) than people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin rated their fatigue as 34.6 compared with 35.6 in people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> Sleep problems (measured on a 0 to 100 scale):
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin reported a reduction of sleep problems (6.2% absolute improvement) than people who took a fake medication.
<ABS> - People who took pregabalin rated their sleep problems to be 54.9 compared with 58.6 in people who took fake medication
<ABS> Stopping medication due to side effects:
<ABS> - 7 more people out of 100 stopped pregabalin compared with fake medication because of side effects (8% absolute deterioration).
<ABS> - 18 people out of 100 who took anticonvulsants stopped medication due to side effects compared with 11 people out of 100 who took a fake medication.
<ABS> Serious side effects:
<ABS> - There were no differences between pregabalin (5.2%) and fake medication (4.1%) in the number of serious adverse events.
<ABS> Dizziness:
<ABS> - 24 more people out of 100 reported dizziness as a side effect of pregabalin (28% absolute deterioration).
<ABS> - 35 people out of 100 who took pregabalin reported dizziness as a side effect compared with 11 people out of 100 who took a fake medication.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue.
<INT> People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
<INT> Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving HRQoL.
<INT> Anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) are drugs frequently used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the benefits and harms of anticonvulsants for treating FM symptoms.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted the data of all included studies and assessed the risks of bias of the studies.
<MaM> We resolved discrepancies by discussion.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included eight studies: five with pregabalin and one study each with gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam.
<RES> A total of 2480 people were included into anticonvulsants groups and 1099 people in placebo groups.
<RES> The median therapy phase of the studies was 13 weeks.
<RES> The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM.
<RES> The amount and quality of evidence was sufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in FM.
<RES> Therefore,
<RES> we focused on our interpretation of the evidence for pregabalin due to our greater certainty about its effects and its greater relevance to clinical practice.
<RES> All pregabalin studies had a low risk of bias.
<RES> Reporting a 50% or greater reduction in pain was more frequent with pregabalin use than with a placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33 to 1.90; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12; 95% CI 9 to 21).
<RES> The number of people who reported being 'much' or 'very much' improved was higher with pregabalin than with placebo (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.55; NNTB 9; 95% CI 7 to 15).
<RES> Pregabalin did not substantially reduce fatigue (SMD -0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; 2.7% absolute improvement on a 1 to 50 scale) compared with placebo.
<RES> Pregabalin had a small benefit over placebo in reducing sleep problems by 6.2% fewer points on a scale of 0 to 100 (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.27).
<RES> The dropout rate due to adverse events was higher with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.07; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 13; 95% CI 9 to 23).
<RES> There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between pregabalin and placebo use (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49).
<RES> Dizziness was reported as an adverse event more frequently with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 3.77; 95% CI 3.06 to 4.63; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 5).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> The anticonvulsant, pregabalin, demonstrated a small benefit over placebo in reducing pain and sleep problems.
<CON> Pregabalin use was shown not to substantially reduce fatigue compared with placebo.
<CON> Study dropout rates due to adverse events were higher with pregabalin use compared with placebo.
<CON> Dizziness was a particularly frequent adverse event seen with pregabalin use.
<CON> At the time of writing this review, pregabalin is the only anticonvulsant drug approved for treating FM in the US and in 25 other non-European countries.
<CON> However, pregabalin has not been approved for treating FM in Europe.
<CON> The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Babies born too early (preterm birth) are at high risk of poor outcomes, and the earlier they are born the greater their risk.
<ABS> Preterm babies are more likely to die or have serious disability as children, including cerebral palsy and other similar conditions.
<ABS> Women who go into very early labour (before 34 weeks) and have their contractions stopped by intravenous drugs are at high risk of going back into preterm labour.
<ABS> Terbutaline is a drug that can relax the uterus and possibly stop contractions.
<ABS> Taken orally, though, it does not seem to prevent contractions returning.
<ABS> Another option is to use a small portable pump that feeds a continuous dose of terbutaline under the skin.
<ABS> This has the advantage of using a lower daily dose with faster onset of action and good tolerability because of fewer side effects than when taken by mouth.
<ABS> We found four studies involving 234 women who had been in preterm labour and had their contractions stopped.
<ABS> We found no evidence of terbutaline maintenance therapy offering any advantages over saline placebo pump or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labour.
<ABS> The review found there are not enough large trials to show whether terbutaline pump maintenance therapy is safe or effective.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> After successful inhibition of threatened preterm labour women are at high risk of recurrent preterm labour.
<INT> Terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has been used to reduce adverse neonatal outcomes.
<INT> This review replaces an earlier Cochrane review, published in 2002, which is no longer being updated by the team.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Four studies were included with a total of 234 women randomised.
<RES> The overall methodological quality of the included studies was mixed; two studies provided very little information on study methods, there was high sample attrition in one study and in three studies the risk of performance bias was high.
<RES> We found no strong evidence that terbutaline maintenance therapy offered any advantages over saline placebo or oral terbutaline maintenance therapy in reducing adverse neonatal outcomes by prolonging pregnancy among women with arrested preterm labour.
<RES> The mean difference (MD) for gestational age at birth was -0.14 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.66 to 1.38) for terbutaline pump therapy compared with saline placebo pump for two trials combined.
<RES> One trial reported a risk ratio (RR) of 1.17 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.73) for preterm birth (less than 37 completed weeks) and a RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.51 to 1.84) of very preterm birth (less than 34 completed weeks) for terbutaline pump compared with saline placebo pump.
<RES> We found no evidence that terbutaline pump therapy was associated with statistically significant reductions in infant respiratory distress syndrome, or neonatal intensive care unit admission compared with placebo.
<RES> Compared with oral terbutaline, we found no evidence that pump therapy increased the rate of therapy continuation, or reduced the rate of infant complications or maternal hospital re-admissions.
<RES> One study suggested that pump therapy resulted in significantly increased weekly cost/woman, $580 versus $12.50 (P < 0.01).
<RES> No data were reported on long-term infant outcomes.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence that terbutaline pump maintenance therapy decreased adverse neonatal outcomes.
<CON> Future use should only be in the context of well-conducted, adequately powered randomised controlled trials.

<H1> Combined oral contraceptives: venous thrombosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Contraceptive pills and venous thrombosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Contraceptive pills are among the most popular contraception methods worldwide.
<ABS> A combined oral contraceptive pill contains two components, the estrogen and the progestagen compound.
<ABS> Despite its reliable contraception action, these pills may present side-effects including obstruction of leg and pulmonary vessels by clots (venous thrombosis).
<ABS> This side-effect is rare but the most frequently occurring serious adverse effect.
<ABS> Different combination pills show different vessel clotting obstruction tendencies (venous thrombosis risk).
<ABS> Evaluation of these different tendencies may play an important role in choosing the safest pill when starting pill use.
<ABS> COC containing higher estrogen doses (>30 μg) with levonorgestrel (a progestagen) or containing cyproterone acetate or drospirenone as progestagen are associated with higher VT risk than the oral contraceptive pill with 30 μg estrogen and levonorgestrel as progestagen.
<ABS> All combined monophasic oral contraceptive pills have the same effectiveness, that is preventing unwanted pregnancies.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Combined oral contraceptive (COC) use has been associated with venous thrombosis (VT) (i.e., deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism).
<INT> The VT risk has been evaluated for many estrogen doses and progestagen types contained in COC but no comprehensive comparison involving commonly used COC is available.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The primary outcome of interest was a fatal or non-fatal first event of venous thrombosis with the main focus on deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
<MaM> Publications with at least 10 events in total were eligible.
<MaM> The network meta-analysis was performed using an extension of frequentist random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> 3110 publications were retrieved through a search strategy; 25 publications reporting on 26 studies were included.
<RES> Incidence of venous thrombosis in non-users from two included cohorts was 0.19 and 0.37 per 1 000 person years, in line with previously reported incidences of 0,16 per 1 000 person years.
<RES> Use of combined oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis compared with non-use (relative risk 3.5, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 4.3).
<RES> The relative risk of venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with 30-35 μg ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, or drospirenone were similar and about 50-80% higher than for combined oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel.
<RES> A dose related effect of ethinylestradiol was observed for gestodene, desogestrel, and levonorgestrel, with higher doses being associated with higher thrombosis risk.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> All combined oral contraceptives investigated in this analysis were associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis.
<CON> The effect size depended both on the progestogen used and the dose of ethinylestradiol.
<CON> Risk of venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with 30-35 μg ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone were similar, and about 50-80% higher than with levonorgestrel.
<CON> The combined oral contraceptive with the lowest possible dose of ethinylestradiol and good compliance should be prescribed—that is, 30 μg ethinylestradiol with levonorgestrel.

<H1> Screening for peripheral arterial disease

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Screening for peripheral arterial disease

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is caused by fatty deposits on the walls of the arteries (or atherosclerosis) that leads to narrowing of the arteries (or stenosis) and obstructions in the major vessels supplying the lower legs.
<ABS> PAD can cause discomfort or pain in the lower legs when walking.
<ABS> People with PAD have an increased risk of death, heart and cerebrovascular disease and often receive treatment to manage their cardiac risk.
<ABS> They suffer from significant functional limitations in their daily activities, and the most severely affected are at risk of limb loss.
<ABS> Many people with PAD do not have any symptoms.
<ABS> Only some people have discomfort or pain in the lower legs when walking, so PAD often goes undetected.
<ABS> One possible way to identify this disease is to screen the population at increased risk of PAD.
<ABS> It is important to determine the effectiveness of screening in preventing heart and cerebrovascular diseases or further progression of PAD.
<ABS> This review found no randomised controlled trial evidence on screening for PAD.
<ABS> High quality research is required to help healthcare providers decide whether screening for PAD in asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals is effective in terms of reduction of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (for example myocardial infarction and stroke), morbidity from PAD (intermittent claudication, amputation, reduced walking distance) and improvement in quality of life.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> In the general population, up to 10% of people younger than 70 years and 15% to 20% of people older than 70 years have peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
<INT> Symptomatic and asymptomatic PAD has an estimated prevalence of 13% in the over 50 years age group.
<INT> However, asymptomatic PAD can account for up to 75% of PAD patients and only 10% of PAD patients have typical intermittent claudication.
<INT> People with PAD are at an increased risk of death, heart and cerebrovascular disease and are recommended to receive treatment to manage their cardiac risk.
<INT> They suffer from significant functional limitations in their daily activities and the most severely affected are at risk of limb loss.
<INT> Many people with PAD do not have any symptoms.
<INT> Only some people have discomfort or pain in the lower legs when walking, so PAD often goes undetected.
<INT> Given the high incidence of asymptomatic and undiagnosed PAD, it is important to determine the effectiveness of a screening intervention in preventing cardiovascular adverse outcomes, both fatal and non-fatal.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Studies identified for potential inclusion in the review were independently assessed by both review authors.
<MaM> We planned to conduct data collection and analysis in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> No RCTs were identified that met the inclusion criteria.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Unfortunately, no randomised controlled trial data are available regarding screening for PAD.
<CON> Therefore, we are unable to determine the effects of screening for PAD in order to guide decision making by healthcare providers and planners.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this question important?
<ABS> Inhaled drugs for COPD have been shown to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and prevent or treat flare-ups.
<ABS> Treatment with these inhaled drugs tends to begin with one inhaler, and additional therapies are introduced as necessary.
<ABS> For persistent or worsening symptoms, long-acting inhaled drugs taken once or twice daily are preferred over short-acting ones.
<ABS> Several Cochrane reviews have looked at the risks and benefits of specific long-acting inhaled therapies compared with placebo or other treatments.
<ABS> However for patients and clinicians, it is important to understand the benefits of these treatments relative to each other, and whether a particular type of inhaled therapy is more beneficial than the others.
<ABS> How did we answer the question?
<ABS> We looked for studies in existing Cochrane reviews and performed detailed electronic searches up to September 2013.
<ABS> Studies were included if they lasted at least six months and compared any of the following treatments versus any other for people with COPD: long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs—formoterol, indacaterol, salmeterol); long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs—aclidinium, glycopyrronium, tiotropium); inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs—budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone); combination long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid (LABA/ICS—formoterol/budesonide, formoterol/mometasone, salmeterol/fluticasone); and placebo.
<ABS> We conducted a network meta-analysis to assess the benefits of each type of treatment (e.g. long-acting beta2-agonists) relative to the others for quality of life and lung function.
<ABS> We assessed the data for six months and 12 months separately and reported six months as the primary findings.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> We found 71 relevant studies, but not all measured the outcomes we were interested in.
<ABS> Forty-two studies were included in the quality of life analyses (measured on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), and 46 were included in the lung function analyses.
<ABS> Evidence from good quality and similar trials supported LABA/ICS combinations as the most likely treatment strategy to bring the greatest improvement to quality of life and lung function.
<ABS> Combination therapy gave an average benefit of 3.9 units over placebo at six months.
<ABS> LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months (-2.63 and -2.29 units, respectively), especially when unreliable trials were not included, but a large degree of overlap in the estimates was noted.
<ABS> Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class for trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), with mean improvement over placebo of 133 mL at six months (95% credible Interval (CrI) 101 to 164).
<ABS> As was the case for SGRQ, LAMAs (mean difference (MD) 104, 95% CrI 82 to 125) were ranked just ahead of LABAs (MD 99, 95% CrI 72 to 128) at six months, and ICSs were the lowest ranked class (MD 65, 95% CrI 33 to 97).
<ABS> For both outcomes, the effects of LABA and ICS used alone appeared to increase when used together for six months, but initial differences between the treatment classes were less obvious after a year of treatment.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and 12 months.
<ABS> Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months.
<ABS> The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1 that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been shown by other reviews) require consideration.
<ABS> Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Pharmacological therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is aimed at relieving symptoms, improving quality of life and preventing or treating exacerbations.
<INT> Treatment tends to begin with one inhaler, and additional therapies are introduced as necessary.
<INT> Several Cochrane reviews have looked at the risks and benefits of specific long-acting inhaled therapies compared with placebo or other treatments.
<INT> However for patients and clinicians, it is important to understand the merits of these treatments relative to each other, and whether a particular class of inhaled therapies is more beneficial than the others.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the efficacy of treatment options for patients whose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cannot be controlled by short-acting therapies alone.
<OBJ> The review will not look at combination therapies usually considered later in the course of the disease.
<OBJ> As part of this network meta-analysis, we will address the following issues.
<OBJ> 1.
<OBJ> How does long-term efficacy compare between different pharmacological treatments for COPD?2.
<OBJ> Are there limitations in the current evidence base that may compromise the conclusions drawn by this network meta-analysis?
<OBJ> If so, what are the implications for future research?

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in existing Cochrane reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR).
<MaM> The most recent searches were conducted in September 2013.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included parallel-group RCTs of at least 6 months' duration recruiting people with COPD.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We conducted a network meta-analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for two efficacy outcomes: St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
<MaM> We modelled the relative effectiveness of any two treatments as a function of each treatment relative to the reference treatment (placebo).
<MaM> We assumed that treatment effects were similar within treatment classes (LAMA, LABA, ICS, LABA/ICS).
<MaM> We present estimates of class effects, variability between treatments within each class and individual treatment effects compared with every other.
<MaM> To justify the analyses, we assessed the trials for clinical and methodological transitivity across comparisons.
<MaM> We tested the robustness of our analyses by performing sensitivity analyses for lack of blinding and by considering six- and 12-month data separately.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 71 RCTs randomly assigning 73,062 people with COPD to 184 treatment arms of interest.
<RES> Trials were similar with regards to methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria and key baseline characteristics.
<RES> Participants were more often male, aged in their mid sixties, with FEV1 predicted normal between 40% and 50% and with substantial smoking histories (40+ pack-years).
<RES> The risk of bias was generally low, although missing information made it hard to judge risk of selection bias and selective outcome reporting.
<RES> Fixed effects were used for SGRQ analyses, and random effects for Trough FEV1 analyses, based on model fit statistics and deviance information criteria (DIC).
<RES> SGRQ
<RES> SGRQ data were available in 42 studies (n = 54,613).
<RES> At six months, 39 pairwise comparisons were made between 18 treatments in 25 studies (n = 27,024).
<RES> Combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked intervention, with a mean improvement over placebo of -3.89 units at six months (95% credible interval (CrI) -4.70 to -2.97) and -3.60 at 12 months (95% CrI -4.63 to -2.34).
<RES> LAMAs and LABAs were ranked second and third at six months, with mean differences of -2.63 (95% CrI -3.53 to -1.97) and -2.29 (95% CrI -3.18 to -1.53), respectively.
<RES> Inhaled corticosteroids were ranked fourth (MD -2.00, 95% CrI -3.06 to -0.87).
<RES> Class differences between LABA, LAMA and ICS were less prominent at 12 months.
<RES> Indacaterol and aclidinium were ranked somewhat higher than other members of their classes, and formoterol 12 mcg, budesonide 400 mcg and formoterol/mometasone combination were ranked lower within their classes.
<RES> There was considerable overlap in credible intervals and rankings for both classes and individual treatments.
<RES> Trough FEV1
<RES> Trough FEV1 data were available in 46 studies (n = 47,409).
<RES> At six months, 41 pairwise comparisons were made between 20 treatments in 31 studies (n = 29,271).
<RES> As for SGRQ, combination LABA/ICS was the highest ranked class, with a mean improvement over placebo of 133.3 mL at six months (95% CrI 100.6 to 164.0) and slightly less at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 100, 95% CrI 55.5 to 140.1).
<RES> LAMAs (MD 103.5, 95% CrI 81.8 to 124.9) and LABAs (MD 99.4, 95% CrI 72.0 to 127.8) showed roughly equivalent results at six months, and ICSs were the fourth ranked class (MD 65.4, 95% CrI 33.1 to 96.9).
<RES> As with SGRQ, initial differences between classes were not so prominent at 12 months.
<RES> Indacaterol and salmeterol/fluticasone were ranked slightly better than others in their class, and formoterol 12, aclidinium, budesonide and formoterol/budesonide combination were ranked lower within their classes.
<RES> All credible intervals for individual rankings were wide.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This network meta-analysis compares four different classes of long-acting inhalers for people with COPD who need more than short-acting bronchodilators.
<CON> Quality of life and lung function were improved most on combination inhalers (LABA and ICS) and least on ICS alone at 6 and at 12 months.
<CON> Overall LAMA and LABA inhalers had similar effects, particularly at 12 months.
<CON> The network has demonstrated the benefit of ICS when added to LABA for these outcomes in participants who largely had an FEV1 that was less than 50% predicted, but the additional expense of combination inhalers and any potential for increased adverse events (which has been established by other reviews) require consideration.
<CON> Our findings are in keeping with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.

<H1> Surgical treatment of stage IA2 cervical cancer

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Surgical treatment of stage IA2 cervical cancer

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide.
<ABS> Cervical cancer is staged (classified using a universally adopted system called International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging) according to how advanced the disease is and whether the cancer has spread beyond the cervix.
<ABS> Stage I cervical cancer is confined to the cervix.
<ABS> Stage I is divided into stage IA and IB.
<ABS> Stage IA is the earliest stage of cervical cancer where the cancer is so small it cannot be seen with the naked eye.
<ABS> Stage IA is subdivided further to stages IA1 and IA2.
<ABS> Stage IA2 means the cancer has grown between 3 and 5 mm into the cervical tissues, but it is still less than 7 mm wide.
<ABS> It is well recognised that survival rates from the disease decrease as the stage at which the diagnosis is made increases.
<ABS> In women with stage IA2 cervical cancer it has been reported that between 95% and 98% survived five years after diagnosis with standard surgery.
<ABS> For stage IA2 disease, surgery or radiotherapy have been the treatment of choice.
<ABS> Standard surgery is a radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.
<ABS> It involves the removal of the womb, the cervix, the upper part of the vagina and the tissues around the cervix (parametrial tissue), as well as the lymph nodes (glands) in the pelvis (pelvic lymphadenectomy).
<ABS> Although this type of surgery has excellent results, it can result in side effects, such as organ injury (bladder, bowel, blood vessel, nerve) and long-term side effects, such as sexual or bladder dysfunction, pelvic cyst formation and lymphoedema (swelling) of the legs.
<ABS> One main disadvantage of radical hysterectomy is that it leaves the woman incapable of bearing children.
<ABS> As cervical cancer is common in women aged 25 to 35 years, this is an important consideration for many women.
<ABS> The alternative surgical treatment is a radical trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy.
<ABS> Radical trachelectomy involves removing the cervix, the upper part of the vagina and the parametrial tissue and the pelvic lymph glands, but retaining the body of the womb.
<ABS> This treatment is well established and appears to be safe and effective in preserving fertility and has a high chance of conception.
<ABS> Late miscarriage and premature labour are the most serious side effects in pregnancies where the woman has had a trachelectomy.
<ABS> Methods
<ABS> This review aimed to assess less invasive types of surgery such as simple hysterectomy, conisation (removal of the central cervical tissue) with or without pelvic lymphadenectomy for women with stage IA2 disease.
<ABS> We searched the literature from 1966 to September 2013.
<ABS> We then checked 982 titles and abstracts, but found no relevant completed clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria only one on-going trial.
<ABS> Findings
<ABS> We identified one large ongoing, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT, a study in which women are allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive one of two treatments: standard versus less radical treatment) that looked at this subject.
<ABS> The results of this trial will be published in the future.
<ABS> Currently there is absence of evidence that any form of surgical technique is better, equal or worse in prolonging survival, improving quality of life or are associated with fewer side effects.
<ABS> The review highlights the need to assess, once completed, the results of the ongoing RCT in order to compare different types of surgery.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women up to 65 years of age and is the most frequent cause of death from gynaecological cancers worldwide.
<INT> Women with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA2 cervical cancer have measured stromal invasion (when the cancer breaks through the basement membrane of the epithelium) of greater than 3 mm and no greater than 5 mm in depth with a horizontal surface extension of no more than 7 mm.
<INT> For stage IA2 disease, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy or radiotherapy is the standard treatment.
<INT> In order to avoid complications of more radical surgical methods, less invasive options, such as simple hysterectomy, simple trachelectomy or conisation, with or without pelvic lymphadenectomy, may be feasible for stage IA2 disease, considering the relative low risk of local or distant metastatic disease.
<INT> The evidence for less radical tumour excision and for the role of systematic lymphadenectomy in stage IA2 cervical cancer is not clear.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group trials register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to September 2013.
<MaM> We also searched registers of clinical trials and abstracts of scientific meetings.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently assessed whether potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria.
<MaM> We found no trials and, therefore, no data were analysed.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> The search strategy identified 982 unique references, which were all excluded on the basis of title and abstract because it was clear that they did not meet the inclusion criteria.
<RES> We identified one relevant large ongoing trial, so it is anticipated that we will be able to add this evidence to this review in the future.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no evidence to inform decisions about different surgical techniques in women with stage IA2 cervical cancer.
<CON> In the future, the results of one large ongoing RCT should allow comparison of different types of surgery.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Platinum-based chemotherapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin, or a combination of these, is used to treat different types of childhood cancer.
<ABS> Unfortunately, one of the most important adverse effects of platinum chemotherapy is hearing loss.
<ABS> This can occur not only during treatment but also years after the end of treatment.
<ABS> Although it is not life-threatening, the loss of hearing, especially during the first three years of life, may lead to difficulties with school performance and psychosocial functioning.
<ABS> Therefore, prevention of platinum-induced hearing loss is very important and might improve the quality of life of children undergoing cancer treatment and those who have survived treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.
<ABS> The review authors identified one randomised study comparing a continuous cisplatin infusion with a one hour cisplatin bolus infusion in children with neuroblastoma.
<ABS> For the continuous infusion, cisplatin was administered on days 1 to 5 of the treatment cycle but it is not clear if the infusion duration was a total of 5 days.
<ABS> The study had methodological problems and only results from shortly after induction therapy were available.
<ABS> At the moment there is no evidence showing that the use of a different cisplatin infusion duration prevents hearing loss or adversely affects tumour response and adverse effects.
<ABS> No data were available for the other outcomes of interest (i.e. tinnitus, overall survival, event-free survival and quality of life) or for other (combinations of) infusion durations or other platinum analogues.
<ABS> We need more high quality research before definite conclusions can be made about the usefulness of different platinum infusion durations to prevent hearing loss in children with cancer.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Platinum-based therapy, including cisplatin, carboplatin or oxaliplatin, or a combination of these, is used to treat a variety of paediatric malignancies.
<INT> Unfortunately, one of the most important adverse effects is the occurrence of hearing loss or ototoxicity.
<INT> In an effort to prevent this ototoxicity, different platinum infusion durations have been studied.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> To assess the effects of different durations of platinum infusion to prevent hearing loss or tinnitus, or both, in children with cancer.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We searched the electronic databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1945 to 4 December 2013) and EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to 4 December 2013).
<MaM> In addition, we handsearched reference lists of relevant articles and the conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (2009 to 2013).
<MaM> We scanned ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) for ongoing trials (both searched on 13 December 2013).

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing different platinum infusion durations in children with cancer.
<MaM> Only the platinum infusion duration could differ between the treatment groups.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and GRADE assessment of included studies, and data extraction including adverse effects.
<MaM> Analyses were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified one RCT and no CCTs.
<RES> The RCT (total number of children = 91) evaluated the use of a continuous cisplatin infusion (N = 43) versus a one hour bolus cisplatin infusion (N = 48) in children with neuroblastoma.
<RES> For the continuous infusion, cisplatin was administered on days 1 to 5 of the cycle but it is unclear if the infusion duration was a total of 5 days.
<RES> Methodological limitations were present.
<RES> Only results from shortly after induction therapy were provided.
<RES> No clear evidence of a difference in hearing loss (defined as asymptomatic and symptomatic disease combined) between the different infusion durations was identified as results were imprecise (RR 1.39; 95% CI 0.47 to 4.13, low quality evidence).
<RES> Although the numbers of children were not provided, it was stated that tumour response was equivalent in both treatment arms.
<RES> With regard to adverse effects other than ototoxicity we were only able to assess toxic deaths.
<RES> Again, the confidence interval of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude differences between the treatment groups (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.07 to 17.31, low quality evidence).
<RES> No data were available for the other outcomes of interest (i.e. tinnitus, overall survival, event-free survival and quality of life) or for other (combinations of) infusion durations or other platinum analogues.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> Since only one eligible RCT evaluating the use of a continuous cisplatin infusion versus a one hour bolus cisplatin infusion was found, and that had methodological limitations, no definitive conclusions can be made.
<CON> It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'.
<CON> For other (combinations of) infusion durations and other platinum analogues no eligible studies were identified.
<CON> More high quality research is needed.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> A number of policy directives are aimed at enabling people with drug problems to live healthy, crime-free lives.
<ABS> Drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems represent a group of people who access treatment for a variety of different reasons.
<ABS> The complexity of the two problems makes the treatment and rehabilitation of this group of people particularly challenging.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> The review authors searched scientific databases and internet resources to identify randomised controlled trials (where participants are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) of interventions to reduce, eliminate, or prevent relapse or criminal activity of drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental illness.
<ABS> We included people of any gender, age or ethnicity.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We identified eight trials (three of which are awaiting classification) evaluating treatments for drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental illness.
<ABS> The interventions included case management via a mental health court, a therapeutic community and an evaluation of motivational interviewing techniques and cognitive skills (a person's ability to process thoughts) in comparison to relaxation training.
<ABS> Overall, the combined interventions were not found to reduce self report drug use, but did have some impact on re-incarceration rates, but not re-arrest.
<ABS> A specific analysis of therapeutic community interventions did subsequently reduce re-incarceration but proved to be less effective for re-arrest and self report drug use.
<ABS> Two single studies evaluating case management via a mental health drug court and motivational interviewing and cognitive skills did not show significant reductions in criminal activity and self report drug use respectively.
<ABS> Little information is provided on the costs and cost-effectiveness of such interventions and trial evaluations focusing specifically on the needs of drug misusing offenders with co-occurring mental health problems are required.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> This review was limited by the lack of information reported in this group of trials and the quality of the evidence is unclear.
<ABS> The evidence is current to March 2013.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> This is an updated version of an original Cochrane review published in Issue 3 2006 (Perry 2006).
<INT> The review represents one from a family of four reviews focusing on interventions for drug-using offenders.
<INT> This specific review considers interventions aimed at reducing drug use or criminal activity, or both for drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental illness.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We contacted experts in the field for further information.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We also reported data on the cost and cost effectiveness of interventions.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified 76 trials across the four reviews.
<RES> Following a process of pre-screening, we judged eight trials to meet the inclusion criteria for this specific review (three of the five trials are awaiting classification).
<RES> The five included 1502 participants.
<RES> The interventions reported on case management via a mental health drugs court, a therapeutic community, and an evaluation of a motivational interviewing technique and cognitive skills in comparison to relaxation training.
<RES> The methodological quality of the trials was generally difficult to rate due to a lack of clear reporting.
<RES> On most risk of bias items, we rated the majority of studies as unclear.
<RES> Overall, the combined interventions did not show a statistically significant reduction in self reported drug use (2 studies, 715 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.55).
<RES> A statistically significantly reduction was shown for re-incarceration (4 studies, 627 participants; RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67 and mean difference (MD) 28.72, 95% CI 5.89 to 51.54) but not re-arrest (2 studies, 518 participants; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12).
<RES> A specific subgroup analysis combining studies using therapeutic community interventions showed a statistically significant reduction in re-incarceration (2 studies, 266 participants; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.54) but not re-arrest (1 study, 428 participants; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.33).
<RES> Case management via a mental health court and motivational interviewing with cognitive skills did not show a statistically significant reduction in criminal activity (1 study, 235 participants; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22) or self reported drug misuse (1 study, 162 participants; MD -7.42, 95% CI -20.12 to 5.28).
<RES> Due to the small number of studies, we were unable to analyse the impact of setting on outcome.
<RES> Some cost information was provided in the trials but not sufficient to be able to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the interventions.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review highlights the paucity of evidence for drug misusing offenders with co-occurring mental health problems.
<CON> Two of the five trials showed some promising results for the use of therapeutic communities and aftercare, but only in relation to reducing subsequent re-incarceration.
<CON> The studies overall, showed a high degree of statistical variation demonstrating a degree of caution in the interpretation of the magnitude of effect and direction of benefit for treatment outcomes.
<CON> More evaluations are required to assess the effectiveness of interventions for drug-using offenders with co-occurring mental health problems.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Why is this question important?
<ABS> Asthma is a long-term condition that causes coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness.
<ABS> When symptoms significantly worsen, often referred to as an attack or 'exacerbation,' this can be life threatening.
<ABS> Management of exacerbations in the emergency department (ED) varies, and some guidelines recommend the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) when other treatments have not helped.
<ABS> However, it is unclear whether IV MgSO4 is effective, particularly in less severe cases, and we wanted to answer this question.
<ABS> How did we answer the question?
<ABS> We looked for trials that compared IV MgSO4 versus placebo in adults attending the ED with an asthma exacerbation.
<ABS> The most recent searches were done on 2 May 2014.
<ABS> We were interested primarily in whether IV MgSO4 reduced the number of people needing to be admitted to hospital, and we looked at several other measures as well, including time spent in the ED, lung function and symptom scores.
<ABS> What did we find?
<ABS> Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 2313 people.
<ABS> These studies varied in terms of how bad exacerbations had to be for people to be included and in terms of what other treatments were provided before IV MgSO4was given, but almost all trials gave participants at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting medications and steroid tablets or injection.
<ABS> Overall, IV MgSO4 reduced the need for hospital admission compared with placebo (seven fewer per 100 treated; 95% confidence interval two to 13 fewer).
<ABS> Not enough information was available to show whether the reduction in hospital admissions was associated with severity of the asthma exacerbation, or whether it made a difference what other treatments were given.
<ABS> Evidence suggests that IV MgSO4 improved some lung function parameters, but for other measures such as heart rate, variation among study findings reduced our confidence in the results.
<ABS> We did not find a difference between IV MgSO4 and placebo in most other measures (including time spent in the ED, respiratory rate and blood pressure), and adverse events generally were poorly reported.
<ABS> Conclusion
<ABS> This review showed that IV MgSO4 reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with exacerbations of asthma when other first-line medications have not relieved the acute symptoms (i.e. oxygen, inhaled short-acting medications and IV steroids).
<ABS> Evidence for other measures of benefit and safety was limited.
<ABS> Researchers should clearly define the severity of the asthma condition among people in their studies while carefully recording adverse events.
<ABS> This plain language summary is current as of May 2014.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible.
<INT> Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services.
<INT> Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment.
<INT> However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014.
<MaM> We also searched www.ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data.
<MaM> Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information.
<MaM> We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models.
<MaM> We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1.
<MaM> We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication.
<MaM> Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review.
<RES> Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo.
<RES> Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials.
<RES> Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide.
<RES> Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years.
<RES> Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I2 = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence).
<RES> In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer).
<RES> The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I2 = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I2 = 0%, P value 0.82).
<RES> Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions.
<RES> Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4.
<RES> No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure).
<RES> Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed.
<RES> The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids.
<CON> Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4.
<CON> Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety.
<CON> Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events.
<CON> Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Use of two contraceptive methods (dual-method use) refers to using condoms plus another modern method of contraception.
<ABS> The latter method is usually hormonal (like birth control pills) or a non-hormonal intrauterine system.
<ABS> Unprotected sex results in disease and death in many areas of the world due to HIV/STI.
<ABS> Millions of women, especially in lower-resource areas, also have an unmet need for preventing unplanned pregnancy.
<ABS> We examined studies of dual-method use, which can better prevent pregnancy and protect against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
<ABS> Through January 2014, we did computer searches for studies of programs to improve use of dual-methods.
<ABS> We wrote to researchers to find missing data.
<ABS> Studies examined a behavioral intervention for improving dual-method use.
<ABS> The educational program had to address preventing pregnancy and HIV/STI by using condoms plus another modern contraceptive.
<ABS> The intervention was compared with a different program, usual care, or no intervention.
<ABS> We only found four studies to include.
<ABS> Three were randomized trials and the fourth was a pilot study for one of the included trials.
<ABS> The programs differed from one another.
<ABS> They included computer-delivered sessions tailored for each person; phone counseling added to clinic counseling; and case management plus a peer-leadership program.
<ABS> In the latter study, more women in the intervention group reported regular use of dual methods, namely birth control pills plus condoms, than the control group.
<ABS> The pilot study reported a trend toward more regular dual-method use for the intervention group compared to the control group.
<ABS> The other two trials did not show any major difference between the study groups in reported use of dual methods or in test results for pregnancy or STIs.
<ABS> We found few programs to improve use of dual methods, and only one showed an effect.
<ABS> The reports gave enough information on how the interventions were conducted.
<ABS> The studies had adequate follow-up periods of 12 to 24 months.
<ABS> However, the overall quality of results was low, mainly due to study design and losing many women to follow up.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Dual-method contraception refers to using condoms as well as another modern method of contraception.
<INT> The latter (usually non-barrier) method is commonly hormonal (e.g., oral contraceptives) or a non-hormonal intrauterine device.
<INT> Use of two methods can better prevent pregnancy and the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared to single-method use.
<INT> Unprotected sex increases risk for disease, disability, and mortality in many areas due to the prevalence and incidence of HIV/STI.
<INT> Millions of women, especially in lower-resource areas, also have an unmet need for protection against unintended pregnancy.

<OBJ> ABS OBJECTIVES
<OBJ> We examined comparative studies of behavioral interventions for improving use of dual methods of contraception.
<OBJ> Dual-method use refers to using condoms as well as another modern contraceptive method.
<OBJ> Our intent was to identify effective interventions for preventing pregnancy as well as HIV/STI transmission.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP for current trials and trials with relevant data or reports.
<MaM> We examined reference lists of pertinent papers, including review articles, for additional reports.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> Studies could be either randomized or non-randomized.
<MaM> They examined a behavioral intervention with an educational or counseling component to encourage or improve the use of dual methods, i.e., condoms and another modern contraceptive.
<MaM> The intervention had to address preventing pregnancy as well as the transmission of HIV/STI.
<MaM> The program or service could be targeted to individuals, couples, or communities.
<MaM> The comparison condition could be another behavioral intervention to improve contraceptive use, usual care, other health education, or no intervention.
<MaM> Studies had to report use of dual methods, i.e., condoms plus another modern contraceptive method.
<MaM> We focused on the investigator’s assessment of consistent dual-method use or use at last sex.
<MaM> Outcomes had to be measured at least three months after the behavioral intervention began.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors evaluated abstracts for eligibility and extracted data from included studies.
<MaM> For the dichotomous outcomes, the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was calculated using a fixed-effect model.
<MaM> Where studies used adjusted analysis, we presented the results as reported by the investigators.
<MaM> No meta-analysis was conducted due to differences in interventions and outcome measures.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We identified four studies that met the inclusion criteria: three randomized controlled trials and a pilot study for one of the included trials.
<RES> The interventions differed markedly: computer-delivered, individually tailored sessions; phone counseling added to clinic counseling; and case management plus a peer-leadership program.
<RES> The latter study, which addressed multiple risks, showed an effect on contraceptive use.
<RES> Compared to the control group, the intervention group was more likely to report consistent dual-method use, i.e., oral contraceptives and condoms.
<RES> The reported relative risk was 1.58 at 12 months (95% CI 1.03 to 2.43) and 1.36 at 24 months (95% CI 1.01 to 1.85).
<RES> The related pilot study showed more reporting of consistent dual-method use for the intervention group compared to the control group (reported P value = 0.06); the investigators used a higher alpha (P < 0.10) for this pilot study.
<RES> The other two trials did not show any significant difference between the study groups in reported dual-method use or in test results for pregnancy or STIs at 12 or 24 months.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found few behavioral interventions for improving dual-method contraceptive use and little evidence of effectiveness.
<CON> A multifaceted program showed some effect but only had self-reported outcomes.
<CON> Two trials were more applicable to clinical settings and had objective outcomes measures, but neither showed any effect.
<CON> The included studies had adequate information on intervention fidelity and sufficient follow-up periods for change to occur.
<CON> However, the overall quality of evidence was considered low.
<CON> Two trials had design limitations and two had high losses to follow up, as often occurs in contraceptive trials.
<CON> Good quality studies are still needed of carefully designed and implemented programs or services.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> This review summarises trials evaluating the effects of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) compared to other artemisinin-based combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization.
<ABS> After searching for relevant trials up to July 2013, we included 27 randomized controlled trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children and conducted between 2002 and 2010.
<ABS> What is uncomplicated malaria and how might dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine work
<ABS> Uncomplicated malaria is the mild form of malaria which usually causes a fever, with or without headache, tiredness, muscle pains, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting.
<ABS> If left untreated, uncomplicated malaria can develop into severe malaria with kidney failure, breathing difficulties, fitting, unconsciousness, and eventually death.
<ABS> DHA-P is one of five artemisinin-based combination therapies the World Health Organization currently recommends to treat malaria.
<ABS> These combinations contain an artemisinin component (such as dihydroartemisinin) which works very quickly to clear the malaria parasite from the person's blood, and a longer acting drug (such as piperaquine) which clears the remaining parasites from the blood and may prevent new infections with malaria for several weeks.
<ABS> What the research says
<ABS> DHA-P versus artemether lumefantrine
<ABS> In studies of people living in Africa, both DHA-P and artemether-lumefantrine are very effective at treating malaria (high quality evidence).
<ABS> However, DHA-P cures slightly more patients than artemether-lumefantrine, and it also prevents further malaria infections for longer after treatment (high quality evidence).
<ABS> DHA-P and artemether-lumefantrine probably have similar side effects (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<ABS> In studies of people living in Asia, DHA-P is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at treating malaria (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Artesunate plus mefloquine probably causes more nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations than DHA-P (moderate quality evidence).
<ABS> Overall, in some people, DHA-P has been seen to cause short term changes in electrocardiographs tracing the conduction of the heart rhythm (low quality evidence), but these small changes on the electrocardiograph resolved within one week without serious consequences.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
<INT> This review aims to assist the decision-making of malaria control programmes by providing an overview of the relative effects of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) versus other recommended ACTs.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes were effects on gametocytes, haemoglobin, and adverse events.
<MaM> We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 27 trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children, and conducted between 2002 and 2010.
<RES> Most trials excluded infants aged less than six months and pregnant women.
<RES> DHA-P versus artemether-lumefantrine
<RES> In Africa, over 28 days follow-up, DHA-P is superior to artemether-lumefantrine at preventing further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.39, nine trials, 6200 participants, high quality evidence), and although PCR-adjusted treatment failure was below 5% for both ACTs, it was consistently lower with DHA-P (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62, nine trials, 5417 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P has a longer prophylactic effect on new infections which may last for up to 63 days (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78, two trials, 3200 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> In Asia and Oceania, no differences have been shown at day 28 (four trials, 1143 participants, moderate quality evidence), or day 63 (one trial, 323 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> Compared to artemether-lumefantrine, no difference was seen in prolonged QTc (low quality evidence), and no cardiac arrhythmias were reported.
<RES> The frequency of other adverse events is probably similar with both combinations (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquine
<RES> In Asia, over 28 days follow-up, DHA-P is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at preventing further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: eight trials, 3487 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> Once adjusted by PCR to exclude new infections, treatment failure at day 28 was below 5% for both ACTs in all eight trials, but lower with DHA-P in two trials (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.41 95% CI 0.21 to 0.80, eight trials, 3482 participants, high quality evidence).
<RES> Both combinations contain partner drugs with very long half-lives and no consistent benefit in preventing new infections has been seen over 63 days follow-up (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: five trials, 2715 participants, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> In the only trial from South America, there were fewer recurrent parastaemias over 63 days with artesunate plus mefloquine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.40 to 27.35, one trial, 445 participants, low quality evidence), but no differences were seen once adjusted for new infections (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: one trial, 435 participants, low quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P is associated with less nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations compared to artesunate plus mefloquine (moderate quality evidence).
<RES> DHA-P was associated with more frequent prolongation of the QTc interval (low quality evidence), but no cardiac arrhythmias were reported.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> In Asia, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine, and is better tolerated.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> In the United States of America, current guidelines do not recommend YF vaccine for individuals with HIV infection or AIDS; these recommendations, however, are targeted mostly at travellers to the parts of Latin America and Africa where YF occurs and who have the option of not going.
<ABS> For HIV-infected patients living in these areas where exposure is inevitable, it is important to weigh the risks of vaccination against the risk of developing YF.
<ABS> There are no known medicines for YF, further highlighting the importance of vaccine.
<ABS> The purpose of this review was to assess the risks and benefits of YF vaccine for people living with HIV.
<ABS> We found three cohort studies that addressed this question.
<ABS> One study in children, from a time before effective widespread use of antiretroviral drugs, found that YF vaccine worked much less well in children with HIV than it did in those without HIV.
<ABS> Two studies in adults found that the immune response to yellow fever vaccine was slightly lower in HIV-infected patients.
<ABS> No severe adverse events were observed in patients in these studies.
<ABS> However, because the numbers of people with HIV who have received YF vaccine is small, and serious side effects are uncommon in people without HIV infection, we are not positive about its safety.
<ABS> When it does need to be used, it should be given to people whose viral loads are low and CD4 counts are high.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease prevalent in tropical Africa and Latin America.
<INT> The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 200,000 cases of YF and 30,000 deaths worldwide annually.
<INT> Treatment for YF is supportive, but a live attenuated virus vaccine is effective for preventing infection.
<INT> WHO recommends immunisation for all individuals > 9 months living in countries or areas at risk.
<INT> However, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) advises that YF vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with HIV.
<INT> Given the large populations of HIV-infected individuals living in tropical areas where YF is endemic, YF vaccine may be an important intervention for preventing YF in immunocompromised populations.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors screened abstracts of references identified by electronic or bibliographic searches according to inclusion and exclusion criteria as detailed in the protocol.
<MaM> We identified 199 references and examined 19 in detail for study eligibility.
<MaM> Data were abstracted independently using a standardised abstraction form.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Three cohort studies were included in the review.
<RES> They examined 484 patients with HIV infection who received YF immunisation.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> YF vaccination can produce protective levels of neutralising antibodies in HIV patients.
<CON> Immunogenicity of YF vaccine is slightly less in HIV-infected patients compared to HIV-uninfected patients.
<CON> No serious adverse events related to YF vaccine were observed in HIV-infected study participants.
<CON> At time of immunisation, higher CD4 cell counts and lower HIV RNA levels in patients with HIV infection seem to be key determinants for development of protective titres of neutralising antibodies.
<CON> The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was low to very low.
<CON> YF vaccine may potentially be used safely in HIV-infected patients, although our conclusions are limited by small numbers of patients who have been reported.
<CON> To assure maximum effectiveness YF vaccine should be given to HIV-infected patients after HIV replication has been suppressed.

<H1> Laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis

<H1> SUMMARY TITLE
<H1> Laparoscopic surgery for pain and subfertility associated with endometriosis

<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Endometriosis is the presence in inappropriate sites of tissue that normally lines the uterus.
<ABS> It can cause pain and subfertility.
<ABS> Different treatments for endometriosis are available, one of which is laparoscopic ('key hole') surgery, performed to remove visible areas of endometriosis.
<ABS> Cochrane review authors assessed the evidence on the use of laparoscopic surgery to treat pain and fertility problems in women with endometriosis.
<ABS> Laparoscopic surgical techniques include ablation, which means destruction of a lesion (for example by burning), and excision, which means cutting a lesion out.
<ABS> Study characteristics
<ABS> We included 10 randomised controlled trials (involving 973 participants).
<ABS> They were conducted in Australia, Canada, Egypt, Iran and the United Kingdom.
<ABS> Most compared laparoscopic ablation or excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only.
<ABS> Four of the 10 studies reported their source of funding.
<ABS> The evidence was current to July 2013.
<ABS> Key results
<ABS> We found that laparoscopic surgery may be of benefit in treating overall pain and subfertility associated with mild to moderate endometriosis.
<ABS> Laparoscopic excision and ablation were similarly effective in relieving pain, although this result came from a single study.
<ABS> There was insufficient evidence on adverse events to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety.
<ABS> Quality of the evidence
<ABS> The quality of the evidence was moderate with regard to the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery.
<ABS> Additional studies are needed in this field, and these should report adverse events as an outcome.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Surgical interventions aim to remove visible areas of endometriosis and restore the anatomy.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> The quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methods.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Ten RCTs were included in the review.
<RES> The studies randomised 973 participants experiencing pain or subfertility associated with endometriosis.
<RES> Five RCTs compared laparoscopic ablation or excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only.
<RES> Two RCTs compared laparoscopic excision versus diagnostic laparoscopy only.
<RES> Two RCTs compared laparoscopic excision versus ablation.
<RES> Common limitations in the primary studies included lack of clearly-described blinding, failure to fully describe methods of randomisation and allocation concealment, and risk of attrition bias.
<RES> Two studies collected data on adverse events (including infection, vascular and visceral injury and conversion to laparotomy) and reported no events in either arm.
<RES> Other studies did not report this outcome.
<RES> The similar effect of laparoscopic surgery and diagnostic laparotomy on the rate of miscarriage per pregnancy was imprecise (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.54, 2 studies, 112 women, moderate quality evidence).
<RES> The difference between laparoscopic ablation and laparoscopic excision in the proportion of women reporting overall pain relief at 12 months on a VAS 0 to 10 pain scale was 0 (95% CI -1.22 to 1.22, P = 1.00, 1 RCT, 103 participants, low quality evidence).

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> There is moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic surgery to treat mild and moderate endometriosis reduces overall pain and increases live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates.
<CON> There is low quality evidence that laparoscopic excision and ablation were similarly effective in relieving pain, although there was only one relevant study.
<CON> More research is needed considering severe endometriosis, different types of pain associated with endometriosis (for example dysmenorrhoea (pain with menstruation)) and comparing laparoscopic interventions with holistic and medical interventions.
<CON> There was insufficient evidence on adverse events to allow any conclusions to be drawn regarding safety.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Care pathways are packages of care designed to ensure patients have appropriate and effective care.
<ABS> They are commonly used, and often produce good results, but they can also be used as a tick box solution that acts as a barrier to good care.
<ABS> Care pathways have been used to ensure appropriate care for dying people in hospice settings.
<ABS> One, the Liverpool Care Pathway, devised for use in hospices, has been used in general hospital settings to care for dying patients.
<ABS> Its use has been criticised.
<ABS> A review of the use of end-of-life care pathways in the NHS in the UK recommended they be discontinued, one reason being that they were being misused.
<ABS> A concern, mainly raised by relatives, was that opioids were over-prescribed, used to hasten death, to reduce consciousness, and diminish the patient's desire or ability to accept food or drink.
<ABS> This review was commissioned to look at adverse events associated with the use of opioids to treat cancer pain.
<ABS> This clinical trial data set is the most relevant we have to people at the end of life, though people treated for cancer pain are not usually at the end of their lives.
<ABS> The studies are the closest we can get in the absence of clinical studies at the end of life in (mostly) older people.
<ABS> We included randomised trials from Cochrane reviews of four opioids used to treat cancer pain: morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine.
<ABS> This provided 77 studies with over 5,000 people randomised to various treatments.
<ABS> Trial quality was generally poor; particular problems included small study size, and not reporting adverse events in all patients, or all recorded adverse events.
<ABS> Known problems with adverse event measurement, recording, and reporting made assessment even more difficult.
<ABS> The population in the cancer pain trials were mainly aged between 50 and 70 years.
<ABS> For all four opioids together, 1 in 4 people experienced constipation and somnolence (sleepiness, drowsiness), 1 in 5 experienced nausea and dry mouth, and 1 in 8 experienced vomiting, anorexia, and dizziness.
<ABS> Weakness, diarrhoea, insomnia, mood change, hallucinations and dehydration occurred at rates of 1 in 20 people and below.
<ABS> Some of these may be good markers for the effects of opioids on consciousness, appetite, and thirst in end-of-life care in all patients deemed to be dying.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> There is increasing focus on providing high quality care for people at the end of life, irrespective of disease or cause, and in all settings.
<INT> In the last ten years the use of care pathways to aid those treating patients at the end of life has become common worldwide.
<INT> The use of the Liverpool Care Pathway in the UK has been criticised.
<INT> In England the LCP was the subject of an independent review, commissioned by a Health Minister.
<INT> In July 2013, the Department of Health released a statement that stated the use of the LCP should be "phased out over the next 6-12 months and replaced with an individual approach to end of life care for each patient".
<INT> The impact of opioids was a particular concern because of their potential influence on consciousness, appetite and thirst in people near the end of life.
<INT> There was concern that impaired patient consciousness may lead to an earlier death, and that effects of opioids on appetite and thirst may result in unnecessary suffering.
<INT> This rapid review, commissioned by the National Institute for Health Research, used standard Cochrane methodology to examine adverse effects of morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine in cancer pain studies as a close approximation to possible effects in the dying patient.

<MaM> ABS SELECTION CRITERIA
<MaM> We included randomised studies using multiple doses of four opioid drugs (morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and codeine) in cancer pain.
<MaM> These were taken from four existing or ongoing Cochrane reviews.
<MaM> Participants were adults aged 18 and over.
<MaM> We included only full journal publication articles.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two review authors independently extracted adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality.
<MaM> The primary outcomes sought were numbers of participants experiencing adverse events of reduced consciousness, appetite, and thirst.
<MaM> Secondary outcomes were possible surrogate measures of the primary outcomes: delirium, dizziness, hallucinations, mood change and somnolence relating to patient consciousness, and nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, anorexia, asthenia, dehydration, or dry mouth relating to appetite or thirst.
<MaM> Comparative measures of harm were known to be unlikely, and we therefore calculated the proportion of participants experiencing each of the adverse events of interest with each opioid, and for all four opioid drugs combined.

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> We included 77 studies with 5619 randomised participants.
<RES> There was potential bias in most studies, with small size being the most common; individual treatment groups had fewer than 50 participants in 60 studies.
<RES> Participants were relatively young, with mean age in the studies typically between 50 and 70 years.
<RES> Direct measures of patient consciousness, patient appetite, or thirst were not apparent.
<RES> For opioids used to treat cancer pain adverse event incidence rates were 25% for constipation, 23% for somnolence, 21% for nausea, 17% for dry mouth, and 13% for vomiting, anorexia, and dizziness.
<RES> Asthenia, diarrhoea, insomnia, mood change, hallucinations and dehydration occurred at incidence rates of 5% and below.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> We found no direct evidence that opioids affected patient consciousness, appetite or thirst when used to treat cancer pain.
<CON> However, somnolence, dry mouth, and anorexia were common adverse events in people with cancer pain treated with morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, or codeine.
<CON> We are aware that there is an important literature concerning the problems that exist with adverse event measurement, reporting, and attribution.
<CON> Together with the known complications concerning concomitant medication, data collection and reporting, and nomenclature, this means that these adverse events cannot always be attributed unequivocally to the use of opioids, and so they provide only a broad picture of adverse events with opioids in cancer pain.
<CON> The research agenda includes developing definitions for adverse events that have a spectrum of severity or importance, and the development of appropriate measurement tools for recording such events to aid clinical practice and clinical research.


<ABS> SUMMARY
<ABS> Background
<ABS> Hepatitis C virus is mainly transmitted by contact to infected blood.
<ABS> Chronic hepatitis C infection affects around 3% of the world population and progresses slowly.
<ABS> Most patients present without symptoms, or with symptoms like fatigue or liver-related morbidity.
<ABS> Frequently, the disease is discovered by coincidence because of abnormal laboratory results.
<ABS> Around 5% to 40% of all infected patients will develop severe liver damage which can cause severe liver-related morbidities and eventually death.
<ABS> Current treatment consists of pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin and in some subgroups of patients these agents are combined with telaprevir or boceprevir, or other direct acting antivirals.
<ABS> In about 70% of patients with chronic hepatitis C, it is possible to eradicate the virus from the blood, but the clinical effects are not known.
<ABS> Aminoadamantanes (another group of antiviral drugs), mostly amantadine, have been tested in several clinical trials.
<ABS> The authors have previously systematically reviewed amantadine versus placebo or no intervention and found no significant effects of amantadine.
<ABS> Review questions and study characteristics
<ABS> The primary outcomes were the composite of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events.
<ABS> This review includes six randomised clinical trials with a total of 581 patients.
<ABS> Key results and quality of evidence
<ABS> All the included trials were with high risk of bias.
<ABS> This review did not demonstrate any benefits or harms of amantadine on all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and on adverse events, but data were sparse.
<ABS> Compared with ribavirin, amantadine seemed to lead to more participants who fail to achieve sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment).
<ABS> This may be real or due to bias (systematic errors), but it does not seem to be due to play of chance (random errors), as trial sequential analysis confirmed the result.
<ABS> Compared with mycophenolate mofetil, amantadine seemed less effective in achieving end-of-treatment virological response.
<ABS> Compared with interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma, amantadine did not seem to offer benefits.
<ABS> Accordingly, the evidence from this review does not support the routine clinical use of amantadine.
<ABS> Therefore, it is probably better to examine the effects of other direct acting antivirals in the hepatitis C field than to conduct more randomised clinical trials on amantadine.
<ABS> We found no randomised clinical trials assessing other aminoadamantanes, for example rimantadine.

<INT> ABS BACKGROUND
<INT> Hepatitis C virus infection affects around 3% of the world population or approximately 160 million people.
<INT> A variable proportion (5% to 40%) of the infected people develop clinical symptoms.
<INT> Hence, hepatitis C virus is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality with hepatic fibrosis, end-stage liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma as the dominant clinical sequelae.
<INT> Combination therapy with pegylated (peg) interferon-alpha and ribavirin achieves sustained virological response (that is, undetectable hepatitis C virus RNA in serum by sensitivity testing six months after the end of treatment) in approximately 40% to 80% of treated patients, depending on viral genotype.
<INT> Recently, a new class of drugs have emerged for hepatitis C infection, the direct acting antivirals, which in combination with standard therapy or alone can lead to sustained virological response in 80% or more of treated patients.
<INT> In this review, we systematically review aminoadamantanes versus other antiviral drugs.

<MaM> ABS SEARCH STRATEGY
<MaM> The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (1996 to December 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11 of 12, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to December 2013), EMBASE (1974 to December 2013), Science Citation Index EXPANDED (1900 to December 2013), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp), Google Scholar, and Eudrapharm up to December 2013.
<MaM> Furthermore, full text searches were conducted until December 2013.

<MaM> ABS DATA COLLECTION
<MaM> Two authors independently extracted data.
<MaM> RevMan Analysis was used for statistical analysis of dichotomous data using risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
<MaM> Methodological domains were used to assess the risk of systematic errors ('bias').
<MaM> We used trial sequential analysis to assess risk of random errors ('play of chance').

<RES> ABS RESULTS
<RES> Six randomised clinical trials with 581 participants with chronic hepatitis C were included.
<RES> All trials had high risk of bias.
<RES> The included trials compared amantadine versus other antiviral drugs: ribavirin, mycophenolate mofetil, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma.
<RES> Standard antiviral therapy (interferon-alpha, interferon-alpha plus ribavirin, or peg interferon alpha) was administered equally to the intervention and the control groups in five trials, depending on when the trial was conducted.
<RES> Four trials compared amantadine versus ribavirin.
<RES> There were no deaths or liver-related morbidity in the two intervention groups (0/216 (0%) versus 0/211 (0%); 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence).
<RES> The lower estimated risk for (serious) adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with amantadine was imprecise (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; based on 10/216 (5%) versus 18/211 (9%) participants in 4 trials; very low quality of the evidence).
<RES> There were more participants with failure of sustained virological response in the amantadine group than in the ribavirin group (206/216 (96%) versus 176/211 (84%); RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.22, 4 trials; low quality of the evidence).
<RES> Amantadine versus ribavirin more often failed to achieve end-of follow-up biochemical response (41/46 (89%) versus 31/46 (67%); RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.63; 2 trials; very low quality of the evidence).
<RES> One trial compared amantadine versus mycophenolate mofetil.
<RES> There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups, except that amantadine was inferior to mycophenolate mofetil regarding the outcome failure to achieve end-of treatment virological response (low quality of evidence).
<RES> One trial each compared amantadine versus interferon-alpha or interferon-gamma.
<RES> Both comparisons showed no significant differences in the treatment outcomes (very low quality of the evidence).
<RES> The observed effects could be due to real effects, systematic errors (bias), or random errors (play of chance).
<RES> This possible influence on the observed effect by play of chance is due to the fact that trial sequential analyses could not confirm our findings.
<RES> We were not able to perform meta-analyses on failure of histological improvement and quality of life due to lack of valid data in all trial comparisons.

<CON> ABS CONCLUSIONS
<CON> This systematic review has identified evidence of very low quality for the key outcomes of all-cause mortality or liver-related morbidity and adverse events in people with chronic hepatitis C when treated with amantadine compared with ribavirin, mycophenolate, interferon-alpha, or interferon-gamma.
<CON> The timeframe for measuring the composite outcome was insufficient in the included trials.
<CON> There was low quality evidence that amantadine led to more participants who failed to achieve sustained virological response compared with ribavirin.
<CON> This observation may be real or caused by systematic errors (bias), but it does not seem to be caused by random error (play of chance).
<CON> We found no evidence assessing other aminoadamantanes in randomised clinical trials in order to recommend or refute their use.
