Title
Knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and practices towards diabetes mellitus in Kuwait.
Background
Rates of diabetes in Kuwait are among the highest in the world.
Aims
To inform prevention initiatives, this study assessed diabetes knowledge, attitudes towards it, and personal behaviour relating to risk factors among the Kuwaiti population.
Methods
A cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices survey of 1124 people was performed between July and September 2015. Descriptive analysis and χ2 tests were performed.
Results
Although most participants (94%) had heard of diabetes and 87% believed type 2 diabetes to be preventable, knowledge of risk factors was poor [family history (87%), age (44%), low exercise (10%), obesity (4%), diet (0%) and stress (0%)]. Dietary patterns in Kuwait were variable and, of concern, 42% of those with diabetes had been eating more since diagnosis.
Lifestyle, particularly among Kuwaitis and people with diabetes, was sedentary - 47% of participants walked < 20 minutes per day.
Conclusions
Despite the importance of diet and exercise for diabetes prevention, significant gaps in public education clearly exist.
At a policy level, much remains to be done and intensified intersectoral programmes are required to improve public awareness.
Title
Prevalence and determinants of Caesarean delivery in Punjab, Pakistan.
Background
Caesarean section (C-section) is a life-saving obstetric procedure that reduces maternal mortality and improves reproductive health.
Although, vaginal delivery is still an important safe and low-cost method of delivery, C-section is sometimes performed when it is not even required, which creates health challenges for pregnant women and their newborn infants.
Aims
To estimate the effect of a set of institutional, demographic, socioeconomic and spatial variables on C-section delivery (n = 2424) in Punjab, Pakistan.
Methods
We used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Punjab 2014 and multiple logistic regression analysis.
Analysis was carried out using STATA version 12.
Results
Higher maternal age at first marriage, higher number of antenatal care visits, and higher wealth quintiles were associated with higher risk of C-section.
Women in Punjab were more likely to deliver through C-section in private health facilities and there was no significant difference between urban and rural areas.
There was a significant difference in the risk of C-section in different divisions of Punjab, for example, DG Khan and Rawalpindi showed the lowest risk compared with the reference division of Bahawalpur, which is partially explained by the developmental disparities and access to public healthcare facilities.
Conclusions
The government should facilitate access to healthcare facilities in areas that are easily accessible, especially, to rural women.
OBJECTIVE
Substance use services and supports have traditionally been funded without the benefit of a comprehensive, quantitative planning model closely aligned with population needs.
This article describes the methodology used to develop and refine key features of such a model, gives an overview of the resulting Canadian prototype, and offers examples and lessons learned in pilot work.
METHOD
The need for treatment was defined according to five categories of problem severity derived from national survey data and anticipated levels of help-seeking estimated from a narrative synthesis of international literature.
A pan-Canadian Delphi procedure was used to allocate this help-seeking population across an agreed-upon set of treatment service categories, which included three levels each of withdrawal management, community, and residential treatment services.
Projections of need and required service capacity for Canadian health planning regions were derived using synthetic estimation by age and gender.
The model and gap analyses were piloted in nine regions.
RESULTS
National distribution of need was estimated as Tier 1: 80.7%; Tier 2: 10.4%; Tier 3: 6.1%; Tier 4: 2.6%; and Tier 5: 0.2%.
Pilot work of the full estimation protocol, including gap analysis, showed the results triangulated with other indicators of need and were useful for local planning.
CONCLUSIONS
Lessons learned from pilot testing were identified, including challenges with the model itself and those associated with its implementation.
The process of estimation developed in this Canadian prototype, and the specifics of the model itself, can be adapted to other jurisdictions and contexts.
Abstract
The criminal record is a tool to combat repeated infringement. It is a list of infringements committed by a single person.
The second report is accessible to the French National Medical Council and to hospital administration for doctors working in the public healthcare sector.
There is no text establishing prohibition of medical practice with an infringement registered in the criminal record.
However, to be qualified and licensed in the practice of medicine, doctors must be recorded to the French National Medical Council. This one verify the content of the criminal record.
In contrast, any suspension or medical practice prohibition, pronounced through a verdict of the court or a professional order, must be entered in the criminal record.
Medical blunders with criminal sanction can be entered on the criminal record and therefore suspend a permission to medical practice; even whithout a disciplinary sanction.
Must be free from criminal convictions is not a legislative or regulatory necessity but an ordinal requirement.
As it was, a medical student can continue his studies with an infringement registered in the criminal record, if he is not a French National Medical Council registrant and if he is in fact not working in the public healthcare sector.
Abstract
Endurance athletes, either professional or amateur, are consuming non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during their training and races.
The goal is to decrease pain or to prevent a potential pain.
These athletes, especially, the amateurs, do not do not know the side effects and have no medical supervision.
In association with other risks factors such as overhydratation, NSAIDs increase the risk of exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH).
Its frequency increases as the number of long distance events is increasing but it is still unknown.
Risk of acute kidney injury increases also with the use of NSAIDs.
These risks have to be known by physicians and athletes.
Abstract
This narrative review summarizes the current literature on early sport specialization and changes that occur in the musculoskeletal system throughout growth and maturation.
It discusses the impact of development on the motor and sensory systems and how this contributes to movement and coordination in the young athlete.
With the increasing number of youth athletes in organized sport and the popularization of early sport specialization, the purpose of this paper is to educate those involved with the youth and adolescent athlete to important changes that are occurring at this time in development and the implications they have on movement, performance and injury.
It is important for coaches, parents and athletes to understand and acknowledge the changes that are occurring, and to expect some difficulty in adaptation, which may be evident as either a plateau or deterioration in performance, or typical overuse injuries that are seen in the adolescent athlete.
Title
Perceived healthcare workforce needs in Lebanon: a step towards informed human resources planning and professional development.
Background
Research in various countries has previously investigated the competencies required for effective management of health care organizations.
Yet, limited information is available on the skills and knowledge areas, which are currently lacking among the healthcare workforce employed in environments with limited resources.
Aims
The aim of this study was to assess the perceived healthcare workforce needs at the management and clinical/practice levels in Lebanon.
Methods
We conducted an exploratory Delphi study involving two panels of health care professionals and a nationwide survey of hospital directors to assess the skills needed and the healthcare occupations and specialties that are limited.
Results
Based on the Delphi study, the top five needed skills/knowledge areas were: professionalism, ethics, quality management and improvement, strategic planning, and communication.
The need for information management and technology skills was reported by more than 50% of urban hospitals, and highlighted by the two panels in the Delphi study.
Healthcare professionals reported willingness to take continuing education courses.
Hospitals further indicated the availability of financial support and willingness to collaborate with educational institutions for employee training and continuing education.
Conclusions
Our findings set the ground for future research investigating healthcare workforce issues in Lebanon and support evidence-based planning for health human resources.
They may inform the development of national and local policies in the country, which address the human resources needs of the health care system to meet regional and national demands.
Universities, professional syndicates, and nongovernmental organizations may leverage these findings to develop continuing education training and diplomas incorporating the competencies critical for the healthcare workforce.
Abstract
A global approach is mandatory for people with epilepsy.
Epileptic seizures occur with unpredictable frequency in unexpected place.
Patients with epilepsy have fourfold risk of comorbidities (especially cognitive and psychiatric) which reduce quality of life.
For improving the lives of persons with epilepsy the stigma and social burden associated withepilepsy must be reduced.
Arriving at a more comprehensive and integrative treatment concept is important.
Title
Assessment of undernutrition using Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure among children aged < 5 years in rural Yemen.
Background
Impaired nutritional status is a major health problem affecting young children in developing countries that has a significant impact on child morbidity and mortality.
Aims
This study aimed to assess the prevalence of undernutrition among children aged < 5 years, using conventional indices and the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF), and then comparing their estimated results.
Methods
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted and information was collected through house-tohouse visits using precoded structured records.
We analysed data from 1292 children aged 6-59 months, from Ahwar and Al-Mahfed rural districts in Abyan Governate, South Yemen, with reference to the 2006 World Health Organization growth standards.
Results
CIAF identified undernutrition in 70.1% of children, while conventional anthropometric indices revealed 38.5% stunting, 39.9% wasting, and 55.1% underweight.
Compared with conventional indices, CIAF aggregate recognized 31.6%, 30.2% and 15% more undernourished children than stunting, wasting and underweight separately.
According to CIAF, 21% had a single anthropometric failure and 49.2% exhibited multiple failures.
Stunting Index, Wasting Index and Underweight Index were 0.55, 0.57 and 0.79, respectively.
Conclusions
CIAF gives a better estimate of undernutrition than currently used conventional indices; identifies more children with multiple anthropometric failures; and reflects a wider view of the extent and pattern of undernutrition of children living in communities with limited resource settings.
Abstract
Fighting leukemia using the immune system (antibodies, lymphocytes) is an old idea, which has already been fulfilled in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
To limit the adverse effects on bystander organs (graft-versus-host disease), autologous T cells can be engineered to express synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with artificially redirected antigen specificity.
Autologous T cells engineered to express a CAR targeting CD19 have shown unprecedented efficacy in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.
In this review article, we describe the therapeutic strategies, clinical trial results, side effects and future direction of CAR T cell therapy in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other pediatric cancers and its future role in the Swiss setting.
Abstract
The strategy for the management of hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes was updated in October 2018 by a group of experts of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD).
They are triggered by the results of cardiovascular outcome trials published since 2015, which demonstrated a cardiovascular (and renal) protection with two classes of medications, SGLT2 inhibitors (gliflozins) and some GLP-1 receptor agonists (mainly liraglutide) in patients with established cardiovascular disease.
Thus, after failure of lifestyle and metformin, the addition of one of these agents is recommended in presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
In case of heart failure or renal disease, the preference is given to a SGLT2 inhibitor, provided that estimated glomerular filtration rate is adequate (superior to 45-60 ml/min/1.73 m²).
In all other patients, the choice is guided by the main objective, in concertation with the patient : to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (gliptin, gliflozin, pioglitazone or GLP1 receptor agonist), body weight excess (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor) or medication cost (sulphonylurea, pioglitazone).
If oral treatment is insufficient, the preference is now given to a GLP-1 receptor agonist rather than basal insulin.
Thus, instead of a glucocentric and metabolic viewpoint predominant in the previous position statement, a paradigm change is proposed, focusing on cardiovascular and renal protection, within a patient-centred approach.
Background
Despite recent investments into reducing errors and adverse events in health care, methods for quality improvement in surgery are outdated and ineffective.
Most current efforts in this field are centred around morbidity and mortality conferences (MMCs), which have remained unchanged for over 100 years.
The present study aimed to quantify the recall bias associated with details from surgical cases.
Methods
We gathered immediate postoperative questionnaires from 1 surgeon, 1 fellow and 11 trainees following 25 routine surgical cases.
Information elicited included their perceived level of concentration, mental preparedness and assessment of whether the procedure deviated from its expected course, including any intraoperative adverse events.
We readministered the questionnaire 7−9 days later to assess participants’ ability to recall important aspects of the procedure.
Results
After 1 week, members of the surgical team were universally inaccurate in their recollection of even major details from the operating room.
Although most participants felt mentally prepared and perceived no issues with concentration during the case, all participants misclassified operations as having been performed with or without adverse events in almost every included case.
Conclusion
Our findings show that recall bias regarding surgical safety events is exceedingly common.
This likely has a major impact on the integrity of data presented at MMCs.
Abstract
Diagnosis and treatment of HIV primary infection : the earlier, the better !
In France, the HIV epidemic is far from being controlled and it is estimated that more than 7000 new infections still occur each year.
HIV primary infection is a critical time in terms of the risk of contagion of the partners.
The risk of evolution of the infection is clearly decreased if the treatment is initiated at the earliest since the benefits of early treatment are now well established. Moreover, the low toxicity of actual treatments facilitates long-term adherence.
The challenges of reducing the HIV epidemic in France are therefore to encourage the medical community to widely offer an HIV test to those exposed and to initiate treatment as soon as possible.
Abstract
Canadian provincial and territorial governments have enacted legislation in response to health risks of artificial ultraviolet radiation from indoor tanning.
Areas of strength across jurisdictions are youth access restrictions (n = 11), posting of warning signs (n = 11), penalties (n = 11) and restrictions on advertising and marketing targeted to youth (n = 7).
Background
Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) has several advantages over deceased donor kidney transplantation.
Yet rates of living donation are declining in Canada and there exists significant interprovincial variability.
Efforts to improve living donation tend to focus on the patient and barriers identified at their level, such as not knowing how to ask for a kidney or lack of education.
These efforts favor those who have the means and the support to find living donors.
Thus, a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)-organized workshop recommended that education efforts to understand and remove barriers should focus on health professionals (HPs).
Despite this, little attention has been paid to what they identify as barriers to discussing LDKT with their patients.
Objective
Our aim was to explore HP-identified barriers to discuss living donation with patients in 3 provinces of Canada with low (Quebec), moderate (Ontario), and high (British Columbia) rates of LDKT.
Design
This study consists of an interpretive descriptive approach as it enables to move beyond description and inform clinical practice.
Setting
Purposive criterion and quota sampling were used to recruit HPs from Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia who are involved in the care of patients with kidney disease and/or with transplant coordination.
Patients
Not applicable.
Measurements
Semistructured interviews were conducted.
The interview guide was developed based on a preliminary analytical framework and a review of the literature.
Methods
Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data stemming from the interviews. The coding process comprised of a deductive and inductive approach, and the use of a qualitative analysis software (NVivo 11).
Following this, themes were identified and developed. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was obtained.
In total, we conducted 16 telephone interviews as thematic saturation was attained.
Results
Six predominant themes emerged: (1) lack of communication between transplant and dialysis teams, (2) absence of referral guidelines, (3) role perception and lack of multidisciplinary involvement, (4) HP's lack of information and training, (5) negative attitudes of some HP toward LDKT, (6) patient-level barriers as defined by the HP. HPs did mention patients' attitudes and some characteristics as the main barriers to discussions about living donation; this was noted in all provinces.
HPs from Ontario and British Columbia indicated multiple strategies being implemented to address some of these barriers.
Those from Ontario mentioned strategies that center on the core principles of provincial-level standardization, while those from British Columbia center on engaging the entire multidisciplinary team and improved role perception.
We noted a dearth of such efforts in Quebec; however, efforts around education and promotion, while tentative, have emerged.
Limitations
Social desirability and selection bias. Our analysis might not be applicable to other provinces.
Conclusions
HPs involved with the referral and coordination of transplantation play a major role in access to LDKT. We have identified challenges they face when discussing living donation with their patients that warrant further assessment and research to inform policy change.
Abstract
Rabies control in Europe: an overview of past, current and future strategies. Europe's step-by-step approach to tackling canine and wildlife-mediated rabies has proven that the disease can be controlled and eliminated at the animal source.
A decade of development work and support by the European Union has resulted in a successful oral rabies vaccination campaign for foxes and raccoon dogs, and provided the blueprint for eliminating wildlife-mediated rabies.
In this paper, the authors examine the historical stages of animal rabies control and its eventual elimination in parts of Europe, particularly Western Europe.
In addition, they consider current control measures and predict future challenges, many of which are faced by the vast and sparsely populated, rabies-endemic areas of Eastern Europe.
Abstract
While the legitimacy of medical treatments is more and more questioned, one sees a paradoxical increase in nonconventional approaches, notably so in psychiatry.
Over time, approaches that were considered valuable by the scientific community were found to be inefficacious, while other approaches, labelled as alternative or complementary, were finally discovered to be useful in a few indications.
From this observation, we propose to classify therapies as orthodox (scientifically validated) or heterodox (scientifically not validated).
To illustrate these two categories, we discuss the place, the role, the interest, and also the potential risks of nonconventional approaches in the present practice of psychiatry.
Abstract
Suliqua® (iGlarLixi) is a fixed ratio combination of basal insulin glargine U100 and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist lixisenatide.
Both molecules exert complementary antihyperglycaemic effects : insulin glargine mainly targets fasting glycaemia while lixisenatide mainly targets postprandial hyperglycaemia.
Thus, iGlarLixi is associated with a greater reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) than each individual component and thereby results in a greater percentage of patients reaching HbA1c ? 7 %. It has a good tolerance profile, with a more favourable effect on body weight compared with insulin glargine alone and less gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with lixisenatide alone, because of a more progressive titration of the GLP-1 receptor agonist component. iGlarLixi (Suliqua®) is presented as two different prefilled pens, one allowing to titrate glargine up to 40 IU/day, the other up to 60 IU/day, both with lixisenatide uptitrated to a maximum of 20 µg/day. This dual presentation facilitates a personalized approach according to patient's needs.
Suliqua® is currently reimbursed, under conditions, for the management of type 2 diabetes not well controlled with basal insulin associated or not with oral antidiabetic agents.
Title
Prevalence and workplace correlates of tobacco smoking among male expatriate workers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Background
Immigrant populations in Saudi Arabia face significant health inequalities, including higher smoking prevalence and lower tobacco cessation rate, but little is known about smoking among expatriate workers.
Aims
To identify the prevalence and workplace correlates of current smoking to enable targeted anti-smoking interventions.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey of 4575 male expatriate workers was used to investigate the associations between self-reported tobacco smoking, sociodemographic characteristics, industry and occupation groups, health insurance status and overall health status using logistic regression analyses.
Results
Current smoking prevalence was 22.9% among male expatriate workers, which was lower than the estimated prevalence in the general population (25.9%). Factors significantly associated with current smoking included being married but not living with family [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.278, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.048-1.560), health insurance coverage (AOR = 1.326, 1.124-1.565), manual (AOR=1.600, 1.234-2.075) and unskilled (AOR=1.788, 1.341-2.383) occupations, monthly income > 2000 Saudi riyal and duration of stay ≥ 1 year.
Conclusions
Concerted efforts at the national (health policies)and employers' levels are required to reduce smoking prevalence among male expatriate workers, including provision of comprehensive health insurance with tobacco cessation therapy as benefits, enforcement of workplace smoking ban, anti-tobacco heal th programmes and web/telephone smoking cessation counselling.
Objective
To obtain an estimate of the size of, and human immunodeficiency (HIV) prevalence among, young people and children living on the streets of Eldoret, Kenya.
Methods
We counted young people and children using a point-in-time approach, ensuring we reached our target population by engaging relevant community leaders during the planning of the study.
We acquired point-in-time count data over a period of 1 week between the hours of 08:00 and 23:00, from both a stationary site and by mobile teams.
Participants provided demographic data and a fingerprint (to avoid double-counting) and were encouraged to speak with an HIV counsellor and undergo HIV testing.
We used a logistic regression model to test for an association between age or sex and uptake of HIV testing and seropositivity.
Findings
Of the 1419 eligible participants counted, 1049 (73.9%) were male with a median age of 18 years.
Of the 1029 who spoke with a counsellor, 1004 individuals accepted HIV counselling and 947 agreed to undergo an HIV test.
Combining those who were already aware of their HIV-positive status with those who were tested during our study resulted in an overall HIV seroprevalence of 4.1%.
The seroprevalence was 2.7% (19/698) for males and 8.9% (23/259) for females.
We observed an increase in seroprevalence with increasing age for both sexes, but of much greater magnitude for females.
Conclusion
By counting young people and children living on the streets and offering them HIV counselling and testing, we could obtain population-based estimates of HIV prevalence.
Abstract
In the first half of the 20th century, rabies in dogs affected Canada, Mexico and the United States of America (USA).
However, the role of wildlife in the transmission of the rabies virus was also recognised and outbreaks affecting both wildlife and domestic animals were documented.
Canine rabies has since been eliminated from Canada and the USA, and is now only found sporadically in a few southern states of Mexico.
Wildlife variant rabies viruses, found throughout the continent and geographically associated with specific reservoir species, have notable public and animal health, as well as economic, impacts.
Early rabies control efforts included legislated dog management strategies and wildlife population reduction, which met with varying success.
In the last 30 years, programmes for the control of rabies in dogs and wildlife have benefited from an 'Integrated Management Approach', combining education, vaccination (parenteral and oral), strategic population control, responsible pet ownership and effective stewardship of natural resources, in addition to cooperation and collaboration among local, national and international stakeholders.
Looking ahead, the goal of eliminating specific wildlife virus variants will be challenged by the potential range expansion of reservoir species, due to climate change and other factors, and the risk of re-introducing eliminated virus variants.
To be successful, programmes must be sustained and accompanied by advances in vaccines, enhanced distribution strategies, monitoring in the field and effective modelling of disease spread.
They should also be informed by robust case surveillance, phylogenetics and an increased knowledge of vector ecology.
Abstract
While the incidence of cholera is decreasing in Haiti, the time required to render stool culture results with antibiogram using the standard method practiced at the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP) remains at an average of 80 hours.
This delay can be further lengthened by the process of rendering the analysis reports to the sites of care which significantly delays the community responses to cholera.
Through this study, we have aimed to assess the reliability of partial results.
We have studied 250 stool samples that were analyzed between January and September 2017 at the LNSP by determining the specificity, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio of i) the identification of yellowish colonies and ii) the identification of yellowish colonies with a positive oxidase assay in comparison to the stool culture.
Compared to the entire process, the identification of yellowish colonies showed a specificity of 56%, a positive predictive value of 69% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.27. The identification of yellowish colonies with a positive oxidase assay showed a specificity of 77%, a positive predictive value of 81% and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.31. The communication of partial results at these steps would likely guide community interventions despite a relative decrease in reliability of the results.
Abstract
Traditionally, the doctor has focused his efforts on mastering medical knowledge.
Given the challenges facing him, the medical institutions and the society, it becomes clear that his concern must also be about how this medical knowledge hits the patients and the general population.
Knowing how to deliver our care is now as important as having the medical knowledge !
In this article, we present new models of healthcare delivery that we implemented or plan to implement in Geneva, Switzerland.
Abstract
Rabies is an ancient zoonotic disease caused by infection with the rabies virus (RABV).
While the circulation of RABV in domestic dogs has been appreciated for centuries, the recognition of bat and wild carnivore reservoirs began in the early part of the 20th century.
Bats are the ancestral reservoir of RABV and a remarkable diversity of species perpetuate distinct lineages of the virus, despite the fact that circulation in bats is geographically limited to the New World fauna.
The circulation of RABV in domestic dogs likely represents a historic shift from a bat reservoir, although the timing and details of such an ancient event have been difficult to resolve from the virus genetic evidence.
Since becoming established in the domestic dog population, RABV has undergone repeated host shifts to wild carnivores globally.
These shifts have most frequently been to species within families of the Caniformia suborder of carnivores.
The circulation of RABV in bats has been linked to host shifts to wild carnivore reservoirs in North and South America.
It is clear that RABV has been incredibly successful at exploiting diverse chiropteran and carnivore hosts.
With improved control of circulation in domestic dogs, surveillance is likely to yield additional discoveries regarding the diversity of wildlife reservoirs and vectors of RABV.
OBJECTIVE
We modeled the impact of changing Specialist Treatment Access Rates to different treatment pathways on the future prevalence of alcohol dependence, treatment outcomes, service capacity, costs, and mortality.
METHOD
Local Authority numbers and the prevalence of people "potentially in need of assessment for and treatment in specialist services for alcohol dependence" (PINASTFAD) are estimated by mild, moderate, severe, and complex needs.
Administrative data were used to estimate the Specialist Treatment Access Rate per PINASTFAD person and classify 22 different treatment pathways.
Other model inputs include natural remission, relapse after treatment, service costs, and mortality rates.
"What-if" analyses assess changes to Specialist Treatment Access Rates and treatment pathways.
Model outputs include the numbers and prevalence of people who are PINASTFAD, numbers treated by 22 pathways, outcomes (successful completion with abstinence, successfully moderated nonproblematic drinking, re-treatment within 6 months, dropout, transfer, custody), mortality rates, capacity requirements (numbers in contact with community services or staying in residential or inpatient places), total treatment costs, and general health care savings.
Five scenarios illustrate functionality: (a) no change, (b) achieve access rates at the 70th percentile nationally, (c) increase access by 25%, (d) increase access to Scotland rate, and (e) reduce access by 25%.
RESULTS
At baseline, 14,581 people are PINASTFAD (2.43% of adults) and the Specialist Treatment Access Rate is 10.84%.
The 5-year impact of scenarios on PINASTFAD numbers (vs. no change) are (B) reduced by 191 (-1.3%), (C) reduced by 477 (-3.3%), (D) reduced by almost 2,800 (-19.2%), and (E) increased by 533 (+3.6%).
The relative impact is similar for other outputs.
CONCLUSIONS
Decision makers can estimate the potential impact of changing Specialist Treatment Access Rates for alcohol dependence.
Abstract
Since four decades epidemiological research has emphasised the necessity to consider social determinants and the social distribution of illnesses in the Swiss population, particularly by gender.
Gender influences social position, living conditions as well as health behaviours over the life-course which all together influence health outcomes.
Despite this evidence, national health policies and strategies tend to consider gender as a background factor, if not to omit its influence on health.
The Health2020 policy and the recent specific national strategies are particularly illustrative.
To exclude or reduce gender as a mere biological factor however hampers the implementation of specific interventions aiming at reducing health inequalities in the name of the social justice principle.
Abstract
Rabies is entirely preventable. All deaths are the result of failed prophylaxis.
Rabies encephalomyelitis has never been reported in anyone who received both pre-exposure vaccination and a post-exposure booster.
Awareness of the risk of contact with rabid animals is crucial.
A lack of basic knowledge and the inaccessibility of expensive rabies vaccines can discourage patients bitten by suspected rabid animals from seeking prompt post-exposure prophylaxis.
Similarly, people working with mammals, residents of areas where dog rabies is endemic, travellers, and others at risk often fail to take advantage of pre-exposure prophylaxis.
However, since human infection by a dog rabies virus has always proved fatal in unvaccinated patients, there is understandable reluctance to accept any change in vaccine protocols.
The intramuscular route of delivery is wasteful and the current, low-dose intradermal (ID) regimen is not always economical or universally trusted.
A new, one-week ID regimen, using less vaccine, injected at multiple sites, and involving two clinic visits, could increase the accessibility of highly immunogenic prophylaxis and reduce the prohibitive cost.
The recent 2018 World Health Organization recommendations for rabies prophylaxis are included.
Title
Implementing an interprofessional education programme in Lebanon: overcoming challenges.
Background
The Lebanese American University has a well-functioning inter-professional education (IPE) programme; this is a fundamental pedagogical approach in healthcare education in which students from different professions learn together, ultimately leading to improving the skills of the health care workforce and thus improving patient outcomes.
The programme includes nursing, nutrition, medicine, pharmacy and social work students, and has now been running for 6 years.
Aims
This paper aims at describing the implementation of an IPE programme in Lebanon by focusing on how to overcome the main challenges.
Methods
We describe our experience using the categories of challenges developed by Sunguya et al.
(2014), where they analysed published reports of IPE programmes in developed countries.
We identified three additional challenges that might be relevant throughout the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region or in countries with similar socioeconomic characteristics.
Results
The challenges encountered in designing and implementing the IPE programme were similar to other programmes: curriculum, leadership, resources, stereotypes and attitudes, variety of students, IPE concept, teaching, enthusiasm, professional jargon and accreditation as well as assessment of learning, security and logistics.
Conclusions
This paper provides data and successful strategies that can be used by planned or implemented programmes in similar socioeconomic contexts in the MENA region.
OBJECTIVE
Minimal knowledge exists on the factors that affect implementation of performance measurement systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
To address this, we describe the implementation of a performance measurement system for South Africa's substance abuse treatment services known as the Service Quality Measures (SQM) initiative.
METHOD
We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of system implementation.
We surveyed 81 providers about the extent of system implementation within their agencies and the factors that facilitated implementation.
We conducted 26 in-depth interviews of providers' perceived barriers and facilitators to implementation.
RESULTS
The overall penetration of this system was high.
Almost all providers viewed the system as feasible to implement, acceptable, appropriate for use in their context, and useful for guiding service improvements.
However, the extent of implementation varied significantly across sites (p < .05).
Leadership support (p < .05) was associated with increased implementation in multivariable analyses.
Providers reflected that high rates of patient attrition, variability in willingness to implement the system, and limited capacity for interpreting performance feedback affected the extent of system implementation.
CONCLUSIONS
It is feasible to implement a performance measurement system in LMICs if the system is acceptable, appropriate, and useful to providers.
To ensure the utility of this system for treatment service strengthening, system implementation must be optimized.
Efforts to enhance target population coverage, strengthen leadership support for performance measurement, and build capacity for performance feedback utilization may enhance the implementation of this performance measurement system.
Abstract
Acute renal failure by acute tubular necrosis.
In adults, acute tubular necrosis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI).
Secondary to ischemia and/or tubular toxicity, the commonly found histological lesions are desquamation of tubular epithelial cells and hyaline intra-tubular deposits.
AKI is frequently observed with a non-altered urine output and associated with a proteinuria less than 1.5 g/24h without albuminuria, hematuria or leucocyturia.
The association of an evocative clinical context and a spontaneous improvement of the AKI confirmed the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis.
The prognosis mimics that of the AKI and is often severe.
Despite a functional recovery, the cellular repair is abnormal.
This "maladaptive repair" phenomenon leads to accelerated renal aging and increase the susceptibility to nephrotoxicity. Consequently, the risk of chronic kidney disease becomes more important.
Actually, no specific treatment of the acute tubular necrosis exists, however, because the "maladaptive repair" phenomenon, for patients exposed to more severe acute tubular necrosis, including those that have functionally recovered, a regular monitoring of renal function associated with simple nephroprotection's measures are recommended over the course of AKI.
Abstract
The year 2018 has been incredibly prolific regarding novelties.
Several studies have given impressive results and offer new anticancer perspectives.
Immunotherapy is gaining more and more place defining a new standard of care for different types of cancer.
In parallel with a new approach combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy that is emerging, new forms of adoptive immunotherapy are on the path of approval by regulatory authorities.
At the decision-making level, a large somatic genetic analysis is becoming dominant, whereas the addition of more specific biomarkers is still needed regarding immunotherapy.
This article aims to summarize the significant new developments in oncology for 2018 concerning the five most common cancers and adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
Abstract
Acute kidney injury related to acute vascular disorders.
A broad spectrum of vascular disease characterized by primary vessel involvement may be associated with acute renal failure.
These diseases are usually classified according to the size of the injured vessel that include the small vessels (thrombotic microangiopathy, kidney injury due to malignant hypertension, scleroderma renal crisis, and cholesterol crystal embolism disease), the medium vessels (polyarteritis nodosa) or the large size vessels (acute renal infarction).
Regardless of the primary pathogenic mechanisms and/or the size of the involved vessels, increased of blood pressure associated with acute kidney injury is a major and common feature of these acute renal disorders.
A prompt diagnosis of the vascular disease causing acute kidney damage is required to reduce the risk of morbi-mortality due to renal impairment and to the systemic consequences of the underlying disease and to start an appropriate therapeutic management that should systematically include blood pressure control.
Abstract
A diagnostic procedure for acute kidney injury.
The definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) is universal since 2011. It is simple, based on the increase in serum creatinine on a short time period.
AKI may be life-threatening, which is why the priority is to rule out hyperkalemia, pulmonary edema, or severe acidosis.
Basically, a three steps process is suggested: an obstruction of the urinary cavities is looked for; circumstances of renal hypoperfusion are considered, and urinary electrolytes measured; by elimination, a diagnosis of parenchymal AKI is eventually made. In that case AKI is in most cases due to an acute tubular necrosis, which implies to collect positive and negative signs: a recent history of hypotension, intake of toxic drugs, etc.
In the presence of extra-renal symptoms, and of urinary abnormalities such as abundant proteinuria and hematuria or leucocyturia, a specialized care is urgently needed and a renal biopsy often indicated.
Title
Trends in occupational injuries and diseases among Saudi and non-Saudi insured workers.
Background
The ongoing industrial and infrastructural development in Saudi Arabia carries a high risk of occupational injuries/diseases.
Aims
To compare trends in occupational injuries and diseases among Saudi and non-Saudi insured workers.
Methods
We used the index values method and slope (S) calculation to analyse the occupational injuries/diseases trends from data in the annual statistical reports published by the General Organization for Social Insurance between 2004 and 2014. Data for 10 565 993 (18.5%) Saudi insured workers (SIWs) and 46 402 079 (81.5%) non-Saudi insured workers (NSIWs) and 896 627 occupational injuries/diseases were analysed.
Results
The distribution of incidences of occupational injuries/diseases among NSIWs (93.5%) was 14 times higher than that of SIWs (6.5%). Occupational injuries/diseases were more likely to increase among NSIWs than SIWs, particularly in the construction, trade, financing and real estate economic activities, and engineering, technicians and service workers occupations.
There was a general decreasing trend in occupational injuries/diseases until 2013.
Conclusions
Non-Saudi insured workers were at high risk of occupational injuries/diseases, therefore, implementation of an effective injury prevention programme is required.
Abstract
Food allergy reduces the quality of allergic children life because of a lethal risk.
Current recommendations are favouring introduction of potentially allergenic foods according to usual, non-delayed, practices.
In allergic children, intramuscular epinephrine is the key treatment of anaphylaxis. A self-injectable device must be prescribed in the presence of a severe reaction risk.
Allergen avoidance is currently best to avoid an allergic reaction.
Specific immunotherapy, essentially oral, is the only treatment for tolerance induction in allergic patients, and may be discussed to prevent severe reactions in the case of accidental ingestion.
Abstract
Screening for chromosomal abnormality such as trisomy 18 in a bichorial-biamniotic twin pregnancy is based on ultrasound and a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) from 12 weeks of gestation.
An invasive examination such as amniocentesis is necessary for a diagnostic confirmation.
The management of these complicated cases consists in performing a selective feticide in the first or third trimester of pregnancy.
Trisomy 18 most often results from a chromosomal nondisjunction of maternal origin.
Indeed, advanced maternal age is a major cause of chromosomal abnormality and a promoting factor of twin pregnancies.
This is a severe condition with a very high stillbirth rate, even though there are certain cases where babies have managed to survive for several years.
Abstract
Acute interstital nephritis.
Acute interstitial nephritis represents 10 to 30% of all biopsy-proven acute kidney injury cases.
This disease is characterised by infiltration of renal interstitial tissue by in- flammatory cells, leading to oedema, tubulopathy and subsequent fibrotic lesions.
There are multiples causes, such as drug-induced nephropathy (either from direct toxicity or immuno- allergic reaction), infectious diseases, auto-immune processes or malignancy-associated kidney involvement.
Extrarenal symptoms are often absent and proteinuria is usually mild with no albuminuria, associated with aseptic leukocyturia.
Treatment of this condition frequently requires corticosteroids, together with withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, initiation of anti-infectious agents or cytotoxic chemotherapy, depending on the cause of nephropathy.
Abstract
Developing a national competency-based curriculum for technical nurses in Egypt.
Nursing in Egypt has evolved over recent decades.
Development has accelerated following recent government recognition of the contribution nurses make to healthcare access, quality and delivery.
A vision to enhance nursing capacity resulted in a recent mandate requiring all nursing curricula to be competency based.
Concurrently, the Educational Development Fund of the Egyptian Cabinet of Ministers drafted a nursing educational plan including a strategy to develop and implement a contextually congruent educational model with proven success comparable to international standards.
This report discusses the 4-year curriculum development project designed to upgrade the current technical-level nursing curriculum to a consistent competency-based model.
The competency-based educational model will be trialled in 3 technical institutes before nationwide rollout and implementation.
Details of the project plan are described, including an overview of curriculum development considerations.
This report provides insights for policy-makers and educators embarking on similar health workforce reform and capacity development initiatives.
Objective
To examine how multimorbidity might affect progression along the continuum of care among older adults with hypertension, diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in rural South Africa.
Methods
We analysed data from 4447 people aged 40 years or older who were enrolled in a longitudinal study in Agincourt sub-district.
Household-based interviews were completed between November 2014 and November 2015. For hypertension and diabetes (2813 and 512 people, respectively), we defined concordant conditions as other cardiometabolic conditions, and discordant conditions as mental disorders or HIV infection.
For HIV infection (1027 people) we defined any other conditions as discordant.
Regression models were fitted to assess the relationship between the type of multimorbidity and progression along the care continuum and the likelihood of patients being in each stage of care for the index condition (four stages from testing to treatment).
Findings
People with hypertension or diabetes plus other cardiometabolic conditions were more like to progress through the care continuum for the index condition than those without cardiometabolic conditions (relative risk, RR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-1.20, and RR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.52-3.26, respectively).
Having discordant comorbidity was associated with greater progression in care for those with hypertension but not diabetes.
Those with HIV infection plus cardiometabolic conditions had less progress in the stages of care compared with those without such conditions (RR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92).
Conclusion
Patients with concordant conditions were more likely to progress further along the care continuum, while those with discordant multimorbidity tended not to progress beyond diagnosis.
Abstract
Discovered in the 1970s, human noroviruses (NoV) are the leading cause of foodborne disease and gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide.
NoV affect people of all ages.
In children less than 5 years old, despite rotavirus remains the main enteropathogen responsible for viral gastroenteritis, NoV become the first etiological virus in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was introduced.
Treatment of viral gastroenteritis is symptomatic.
The key element in front of NoV infection is limiting their transmission.
A rapid NoV detection during outbreak is important in the aim to rapidly implement hygiene measures to limit the size of the outbreak. Prevention of NoV infections relies on the use of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of contaminated environmental surfaces.
In face of an acute gastroenteritis outbreak, the early NoV identification with rapid laboratory tests or molecular biology methods is needed in the aim to implement as soon as possible hygiene measures to limit the size of the NoV outbreak.
Due to antigenically diverse NoV strains and the lack of long term immunity, the development of an effective vaccine is difficult.
Abstract
The skin is the largest human organ playing an important role in protection, thermoregulation and sensation.
Recent studies suggest that a new function has to be added: the storage of sodium. There is increasing evidence that sodium can accumulate in the skin, which suggests that the skin contributes to the regulation of sodium balance in humans, and possibly to the control of extracellular volume and blood pressure homeostasis.
The main product of the skin is sweat.
Body sweat contains electrolytes and urea. Their concentration can increase considerably when sweat production is stimulated by saunas or hot baths.
This finding has motivated studies investigating the effect of stimulated sweating on volume control in patients suffering from kidney disease or heart failure.
Abstract
While the use of fructose as a sweetener and its consumption are associated with increased fat storage prompted by the action of insulin, fructose alone does not acutely stimulate insulin exocytosis from the pancreatic beta-cell, as opposed to the chief secretagogue glucose.
We investigated the effects of chronic exposure to fructose on beta-cell function.
Our results reveal that chronic fructose induces extracellular ATP signaling in the beta-cell, resulting in the potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
This effect is mediated by the activation of the purinergic P2Y1 receptors and is associated with the release of cellular ATP through pannexin-1 channels. Consequently, the interplay between pannexin channels and purinergic receptors, through ATP signaling, represents a novel cellular target with potential therapeutic implications.
Title
Screening of congenital hyperthyroidism in Morocco: a pilot study.
Background
In Morocco we have no reliable information on the incidence of congenital hypothyroidism (HC).
Aims
The aim of our study was to explore the feasibility of a neonatal screening program for this disease in Morocco.
Methods
We conducted a screening campaign in the HC 15 615 newborns in the wilaya of Fez in north-central Morocco.
Results
Twelve cases of hypothyroidism have been confirmed, a frequency 1p1301 births.
When excluding 4 cases of hypothyroidism transients, the frequency of HC becomes 1p1952 births, athyreosis represents 25% of cases, partial agenesis 25% of cases and 50 % of cases had normal thyroid glands in place; 67% are female and 33% male.
The average age of testing was 17.1 ± 6.6 days and the start of treatment was 43.4 ± 8.7 days.
Tracking cases brought under replacement therapy showed a good evolution of anthropometric parameters and psychomotor.
The qualitative study found that parents are monitoring their babies very seriously despite the very low socio-economic class of the vast majority of them.
Conclusions
The results of our study support the need for the establishment of a neonatal screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism in Morocco.
Abstract
Fertility preservation.
The treatment used to treat cancer or other non-cancer diseases have improved the prognosis of these pathologies.
However, these treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy or even surgery) have a toxicity on the ovary or on the testicle with consequently a decrease or an arrest of the production of mature oocyte or spermatozoa.
Fertility preservation uses freezing procedures of gametes (oocytes, spermatozoa), embryos or germinal tissues (ovary or testicle) in order to restore the fertility of cured patients.
The French national sperm banking network (CECOS) is a national network of assisted reproductive technology centers that manage, in a coordinated manner, all of these fertility preservation techniques.
Background
Among older inpatients, the highest incidence of delirium is within the surgical population.
Limited data are available regarding postoperative delirium risk in the acute care surgical population.
The purpose of our study was to establish the incidence of and risk factors for delirium in an older acute care surgery population.
Methods
Patients aged 65 years or more who had undergone acute care surgery between April 2014 and September 2015 at 2 university-affiliated hospitals in Alberta were followed prospectively and screened for delirium by means of a validated chart review method.
Delirium duration was recorded.
We used separate multivariable logistic regression models to identify independent predictors for overall delirium and longer episodes of delirium (duration ≥ 48 h).
Results
Of the 322 patients included, 73 (22.7%) were identified as having experienced delirium, with 49 (15.2%) experiencing longer episodes of delirium.
Postoperative delirium risk factors included Foley catheter use, intestinal surgery, gallbladder surgery, appendix surgery, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mild to moderate frailty.
Risk factors for prolonged postoperative delirium included Foley catheter use and mild to moderate frailty.
Surgical approach (open v. laparoscopic) and overall operative time were not found to be significant.
Conclusion
In keeping with the literature, our study identified Foley catheter use, frailty and ICU admission as risk factors for delirium in older acute care surgical patients.
We also identified an association between delirium risk and the specific surgical procedure performed.
Understanding these risk factors can assist in prevention and directed interventions for this high-risk population.
Abstract
Canine osteosarcoma is a devastating disease with an overall poor prognosis.
Radiation therapy and bisphosphonates are currently used in combination for palliative treatment, despite a paucity of literature that investigates their combined use.
The objectives of this study were to assess the in vitro effects of radiation therapy and bisphosphonates on canine osteosarcoma cells when used in combination.
Canine osteosarcoma cell lines D17 and Dharma were treated with radiation and pamidronate or zoledronate, both alone and in combination.
The effects of these treatments were assessed using clonogenic survival and cell viability assays.
Dose-dependent decreases in clonogenic survival and cell viability were observed for both radiation and bisphosphonate treatment.
Combination index analysis revealed antagonistic interactions when radiation and bisphosphonates were used in combination at specific doses for both D17 and Dharma osteosarcoma cells.
Further investigation of the combined effects of radiation and bisphosphonates for the palliative treatment of canine osteosarcoma is warranted.
Title
From workforce intelligence to workforce development: advancing the Eastern Mediterranean pharmaceutical workforce for better health outcomes.
Background
The pharmaceutical workforce in the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region plays a key role in improving health outcomes through responsible use of drugs and optimizing effective choice and use.
Investment in this workforce's development and planning is fundamental to achieving universal health coverage.
Aims
To provide an overview of the pharmacy workforce capacity trends in the Region and emphasize the importance of workforce intelligence for strategic development.
Methods
A review of the literature and global pharmacy workforce studies conducted by the International Pharmaceutical Federation to identify trends and issues in the Region.
Results
The Region has high workforce production capacity compared to other WHO regions but challenges in workforce planning and intelligence strategies persist.
Effective workforce planning relies not only on quality intelligence, but also on cross-sectoral coordination and stewardship, and the Pharmaceutical Workforce Development Goals provide countries within the Region with a framework for development.
Conclusion
There is no workforce development without workforce intelligence.
Abstract
Acute or chronic leg pain is a common reason for consultation.
It is not a specific symptom and several potential causes have to be considered.
Both functional and vital prognosis can be engaged.
The diagnosis is often based on patient history and clinical examination, whereas the overuse of complementary investigations can lead to confusion.
A good knowledge of anatomy, as well as the different etiologic entities, is essential to evaluate acute or chronic leg pain and to guide the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
Abstract
Current rabies vaccines are safe and, when administered properly, they are highly effective.
In addition, they elicit long-lasting immunity, with virus-neutralising antibody titres persisting for years after vaccination.
However, current regimens require multiple doses to achieve high neutralising titres and they are costly, which means that it is difficult for developing countries, where rabies deaths are highest, to implement widespread vaccination.
New innovations are the only way to reduce rabies disease to acceptable rates.
Numerous preclinical and clinical studies are under way, testing novel vaccines, adjuvants and injection methods.
Research into the use of live vaccines and alternative vaccine vectors is ongoing, while attempts to develop DNA vaccines have so far failed to match the immunogenicity and neutralising capability of traditional vaccines.
The development of molecular adjuvants that induce faster, stronger immune responses with less antigen has yielded exciting preclinical results and appears to edge us closer to a better rabies vaccine.
However, steep challenges remain: molecular adjuvants require administration with live vaccines, and differences in species specificity of immune molecules complicate development.
Over all, the array of research undertaken over the past decade is impressive and encouraging, but most new vaccines have yet to be tested in clinical trials, and the viability of such experimental vaccines in the global market remains to be seen.
Only a vaccine that outperforms currently available vaccines in every area will have a chance at widespread adoption.
Nevertheless, the authors are confident that some vaccine candidates will meet these criteria.
OBJECTIVE
Postpartum Depression (PPD) affects over 15% new mothers.
Its etiology is multifactorial and still partly unknown.
Some hypotheses suggest a link with inflammation.
This review aims to explore the existence of inflammatory biomarkers associated with PPD. The possibility of potential adjunct treatments, linked with these biomarkers, will be discussed.
METHOD
The systematic review of literature was performed using in PubMed, PsycInfo and Embase, and 25 articles were included.
Various biomarkers were identified.
The most often studied are C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins 6 and 10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma.
RESULTS
Although few results appear as significant during the various testing times, the dosage of some inflammation biomarkers, including CRP, at the very end of pregnancy or immediately after delivery could predict PPD. Interactions between inflammation and the corticotropic axis could explain PPD onset. Epigenetic mechanisms could lead to pro-inflammatory state.
Several therapeutics provide interest due to their anti-inflammatory property.
CONCLUSIONS
Further studies are needed to assess these biomarkers value as predictive factors of PPD and to consider adjunct treatments to antidepressants.
If this value is confirmed, the inflammatory marker dosage, in particular CRP, could help to provide early screening of women at risk of PPD, parallel of the clinical evaluation.
A zinc supplementation could then be offered.
