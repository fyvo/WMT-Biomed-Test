Title
Use of complementary and alternative medicine among paediatric patients with hepatogastrointestinal diseases.
Background
The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is becoming increasingly popular in Middle Eastern countries; it is often used for paediatric medical conditions such as chronic gastrointestinal complaints and failure to thrive.
It is also commonly used in patients with chronic hepatic conditions such as cirrhosis and in hepatic transplant patients.
Aims
This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, types and associated factors of CAM use in children with hepatogastrointestinal disease in Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Methods
In a cross-sectional study carried out during September 2013-January 2014, 238 parents of children attending a paediatric gastroenterology and hepatology clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences received a self-administered questionnaire covering associated factors of complementary and alternative medicine use; 210 questionnaires were completed and returned.
Results
Complementary and alternative medicine was used by 103 patients (49%); 74 (71.8%) of these used herbal remedies.
Older age of the child significantly increased CAM use.
Those with previous positive experience of CAM (62.1% of users, 40.2% of non-users) and those who had received recommendation for CAM by health care providers (24.3% of users, 6.6% of non-users) were significantly more likely to use CAM.
Conclusions
This survey demonstrated the high prevalence of CAM use (especially herbal remedies) in paediatric patients with hepatogastrointestinal diseases.
Abstract
The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) is a national cooperative quality-improvement initiative designed to evaluate processes of care and outcomes in vascular surgery.
The purpose of this report is to show the utility of such a database to provide insight into the standard of care provided, to highlight areas of local quality improvement, to benchmark our data against local, regional and national trends, and to ultimately improve safety in Canadian patients undergoing vascular surgery.
We present the history of the database, its spread in the Canadian health care system and examples of quality improvements achieved from analyses of data recorded and retrieved from the VQI.
Using the VQI, our institution was able to decrease the length of stay after endovascular aneurysm repair, decrease the contrast volume in endovascular aneurysm repair, save on costs, and provide medium-term outcome data on peripheral vascular interventions and smoking cessation strategies.
The VQI is a powerful tool to improve patient safety and quality in vascular surgery.
Its ability to create local regional improvement groups fosters a quality-focused culture and is important for Canadian patients.
Abstract
Controversy about dissociation and the dissociative disorders (DD) has existed since the beginning of modern psychiatry and psychology.
Even among professionals, beliefs about dissociation/DD often are not based on the scientific literature.
Multiple lines of evidence support a powerful relationship between dissociation/DD and psychological trauma, especially cumulative and/or early life trauma.
Skeptics counter that dissociation produces fantasies of trauma, and that DD are artefactual conditions produced by iatrogenesis and/or socio-cultural factors.
Almost no research or clinical data support this view.
DD are common in general and clinical populations and represent a major underserved population with a substantial risk for suicidal and self-destructive behavior.
Prospective treatment outcome studies of severely ill DD patients show significant improvement in symptoms including suicidal/self-destructive behaviors, with reductions in treatment cost.
A major public health effort is needed to raise awareness about dissociation/DD, including educational efforts in all mental health training programs and increased funding for research.
Abstract
Glucids are ubiquitous and yet controversial components of our nutrition.
This narrative review focuses on the potential harmful effects of sugars on health, particularly as a risk factor for overweight, obesity or diabetes mellitus.
Current guidelines recommend a daily limit of intake, and notably a restriction on added sugars.
« Keto » diets and intermittent fasting are trending in this era of sugar mistrust.
However, the metabolic benefits are not yet clearly established, and the underlying risks should restrain the prescription of these diets to a population of carefully selected patients.
Abstract
Genomic sequencing, evolution and molecular epidemiology of rabies virus. Advances in sequencing techniques, improved computational methods of sequence interrogation and more accurate collection of epidemiological data through Global Positioning System (GPS) technology are improving our ability to monitor rabies outbreaks and better understand the processes that affect viral spread, evolution and host restriction.
Whole-genome sequencing of rabies viruses (RABVs), using a range of different methodological approaches, is becoming more widespread and permits evolutionary and epidemiological studies at an unprecedented rate.
Such studies are yielding insights into the fundamental processes of viral evolution, including molecular mechanisms of host adaptation and viral emergence in novel hosts.
In addition, sequence data are revealing the importance of both landscape features and anthropomorphic activities as drivers of rabies spread; knowledge that is crucial for disease control efforts.
This review summarises the state of the RABV genomics field and suggests how the above-mentioned approaches can be used to further understand and develop intervention strategies for rabies in the future.
Abstract
Transmission of an infection from health care workers to patients.
The transmission of a communicable disease from a HCW to one or more patients has been demonstrated for airborne transmission disease like flu or tuberculosis and also for blood borne infections like HIV, HBV and HCV through an accidental blood exposure.
The risk is globally controlled by vaccination in HCWs for flu and HBV infections but also by PCI infections control procedures as standard precautions, air precautions, and rapid specific treatment among infected professionals.
The occurrence of a case can be an indicator of a failure in quality in care.
Occupational medicine in Health care settings is crucial in prevention of HCW infection to patient.
Background
On the basis of pharmacokinetic modelling, high-dose acetaminophen by rectal administration has been recommended for neonates needing antipyretic or analgesic therapy, but the safety and efficacy of this approach have not been established in vivo.
Objectives
The primary objective was to assess the safety of rectal acetaminophen administration for neonates, as indicated by changes in the results of hepatic and renal function tests.
The secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of rectal acetaminophen administration in terms of the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R) score.
Methods
This single-centre retrospective chart analysis was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit at a quaternary care children's hospital.
Neonates who received all prescribed doses of acetaminophen by continu - ous rectal administration for 24 h or more, from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012, were included.
For the primary objective, hepatotoxicity was assessed in terms of changes in liver enzyme levels, and nephrotoxicity was assessed in terms of changes from baseline serum creatinine values.
Results
Twenty-five patients, who received a total of 27 courses of acetaminophen by rectal administration, met the inclusion criteria.
Median gestational age at initiation of acetaminophen was 37.0 weeks (interquartile range 35.0-39.8 weeks).
Values of alanine aminotransferase remained within normal limits during acetaminophen therapy for all but 3 patients, for whom the changes were attributable to confounding factors.
Renal function remained unchanged.
The secondary outcome of efficacy (based on PIPP-R score) could not be evaluated because of concurrent use of opioids for most patients.
Conclusions
Continuous rectal administration of acetaminophen over a short period (< 48 h) appeared to be well tolerated.
The conclusions that can be drawn from these results are limited because of small sample size, the prescribing of doses lower than those recommended by the hospital's formulary, and limited blood sampling.
Further studies are required.
Abstract
The long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been promulgated to compensate the low re-impregnation rate of conventional mosquito nets.
Today, the cornerstone of the fight against malaria vectors is based on a large distribution of these LLINs for universal coverage.
Despite this promotion, the question of their effective life in operational conditions remains unresolved.
Between September and October 2013, a survey was conducted in 11 districts of Senegal where LLINs were sampled and routed to the laboratory for assessing their physical integrity and biological effectiveness.
A total of 207 LLINs that were sampled in the 11 districts have been monitored during this study.
These two major brands have a good biological efficiency providing a high rate of knockdown despite their failing physical integrity.
Abstract
The use of the emergency department (ED) by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults undergoes an evolution following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Improving our knowledge about ED use characteristics will contribute to a correct diagnosis and therapeutic approach in this patient group, at the moment they are discharged from the ED.
We conducted a one-year retrospective study on characteristics of ED use involving 1026 patients living with HIV.
The majority of them was treated with antiretroviral therapy (95 %) and had a viral load lower than 50 copies (73.6 %). Among them, 117 patients (11.8 %) were admitted at least once to the ED.
The most common ED discharge diagnoses were related to trauma (30 %). This study shows that the great majority of diagnoses were not related to infectious diseases (6.3 %, of which half were HIV-related).
One hypothesis to explain these results would be that HIV-positive adults in this study had excellent antiretroviral coverage and were well controlled in terms of HIV.
Background
Standardized care protocols offer the potential to reduce postoperative complication rates.
The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was an additive benefit associated with the sequential implementation of the evidence-based surgical site infection bundle (SSIB) and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for patients undergoing colorectal surgery in a community hospital.
Methods
Patients at a single institution who underwent elective colorectal surgery between Apr. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2015, were identified by means of American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data.
Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to the protocol implementation dates: pre-SSIB/pre-ERAS (control), post-SSIB/pre-ERAS and post-SSIB/post-ERAS.
Primary outcomes assessed were length of stay and wound complication rates.
We used inverse proportional weighting to control for possible differences between the groups.
Results
There were 368 patients included: 94 in the control group, 95 in the post-SSIB/pre-ERAS group and 179 in the post-SSIB/post-ERAS group.
In the adjusted analyses, mean length of stay (control group 7.6 d, post-SSIB/post-ERAS group 5.5 d, p = 0.04) and overall wound complication rates (14.7% and 6.5%, respectively, p = 0.049) were reduced after sequential implementation of the protocols.
Conclusion
Sequential implementation of quality-improvement initiatives yielded additive benefit for patients undergoing colorectal surgery in a community hospital, with a decrease in length of stay and wound complication rates.
The amount of improvement attributable to either initiative is difficult to define as they were implemented sequentially.
The improved outcomes were realized after the introduction of the ERAS protocol in adjusted analyses.
OBJECTIVE
Two studies were designed to evaluate the potential cosmetic benefit of a biomimetic, niacinamide-containing moisturizing cream for the first time in humans.
METHODS
In both studies, healthy women were randomized to use two treatments, one for the left side of the body and one for the right, from three options: the test cream, a positive control or no treatment (use of standard cleanser only).
Treatments were applied twice daily for 4 weeks to the face and forearms (Study 1) or the face only (Study 2).
Instrumental and clinical skin assessments were performed by trained technicians.
Study 1 involved tape stripping and a 5-day no-treatment ('regression') period at the end of the 4 weeks.
Independent lay graders were asked to grade the skin texture of subjects in Study 2 from high-resolution photographs.
RESULTS
In Study 1 (n = 66), the test cream significantly decreased the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values on the forearm, and in the cheek area of the face, relative to baseline and compared to no treatment, and increased skin Corneometer values.
The improvements were partially retained during a subsequent 5-day period of no treatment.
Increases in TEWL values on skin subjected to tape stripping were significantly lower after 4 weeks of using the test cream compared to no treatment.
In Study 2 (n = 72 subjects with visible signs of ageing), there was a favourable trend in the change from baseline of a skin roughness parameter, Ra , for the test cream compared to no treatment.
There were statistically significant improvements in the Fitzpatrick wrinkle score compared to no treatment, decreases in TEWL and increased Corneometer values and Cutometer values (R5 elasticity parameter).
Grading of high-resolution images failed to detect the improvements in skin texture (defined as pores, smoothness and unevenness) for the test cream vs. no treatment.
No treatment-related serious or severe adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION
Twice daily application of the test cream over 4 weeks had beneficial effects on skin barrier function, moisturization, wrinkle dimensions and elasticity compared to no treatment.
These studies provide proof-of-concept evidence and highlight the cosmetic benefit of the biomimetic lamellar cream formulation.
STUDY REGISTRATION: NCT03216265, NCT03180645.
Objective
To estimate the association between legal age of consent and coverage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing among adolescents in countries with high HIV-burden.
Methods
We analysed data from adolescents aged 15-18 years, who participated in Demographic and Health Surveys or AIDS Indicator Surveys between 2011 and 2016, in 15 sub-Saharan African countries.
To improve balance in the distribution of measured individual- and country-level characteristics, we used propensity score matching between adolescents in countries with more versus less restrictive age-of-consent laws (≤ 15 years versus ≥ 16 years).
We estimated the percentage of individuals who self-reported that they have done an HIV test in the past 12 months and compared the differences in such testing rates among adolescents exposed to lower versus higher age-of-consent laws.
We also investigated effect modifications by sex and age.
Findings
Legal age of consent below 16 years was associated with an 11.0 percentage points higher coverage of HIV testing (95% confidence interval, CI: 7.2 to 14.8), corresponding to a rate ratio of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.35 to 2.13).
HIV testing rate had a stronger association with lower age of consent among females than males.
The testing rates differences were 14.0 percentage points (95% CI: 8.6 to 19.4) for females and 6.9 percentage points (95% CI: 1.6 to 12.2) for males (P-value for homogeneity = 0.07).
Conclusion
This study provides evidence to support the recent World Health Organization's recommendations that countries should examine current laws and address age-related barriers to uptake of sexual and reproductive health services.
INTRODUCTION
Many Canadians continue to drink alcohol in excess of the recommended low-risk guidelines.
In this study, we visualized the geographic variation of licensed premises alcohol expenditures in Toronto and examined the effects of area-level socioeconomic characteristics, alcohol availability and built environment influences on alcohol expenditures at the Dissemination Area (DA) level.
METHODS
Dissemination Area average total household expenditures on alcohol from licensed premises, from the 2010 Survey of Household Spending, was the main outcome variable.
Moran's I and Local Moran's I were used to quantify geographic variation and determine hot spots and cold spots of expenditure.
We used DA-level socioeconomic characteristics from the 2006 Census of Canada, and the density of licensed premises and other built environment characteristics from the 2008 DMTI Spatial and 2010 CanMap datasets to predict alcohol expenditures in multivariate spatial regression models.
RESULTS
The results indicated that the most significant area-level predictors of alcohol expenditure were the percentage of individuals in management or finance occupations and the percentage with postsecondary education (one-unit increases associated with 78.6% and 35.0% increases in expenditures respectively).
Presence of subway lines in the immediate and neighbouring areas was also significant (one-unit increases resulted in 5% and 28% increases respectively).
Alcohol outlet density was also positively associated with alcohol expenditures.
CONCLUSION
The associations identified between licensed premises alcohol expenditures and small-area-level characteristics highlight the potential importance of small-area-level factors in understanding alcohol use.
Understanding the small-area-level characteristics of expenditures and geographic variation of alcohol expenditures may provide avenues for alcohol use reduction initiatives and policies.
Abstract
The situation of the Amerindian village of Camopi in French Guiana is particular because of its geographical isolation and its socio-cultural environment.
Abstract
Pulmonary artery aneurysm is a rare and multiform pathology related to multiple etiologies and therefore different pathophysiological mechanisms.
Delineating homogenous sub-groups is a pre-requisite to refine medico-surgical management.
The case of a giant PAA without pulmonary hypertension but associated to a dysplastic pulmonary valve is reported.
This association could be in some instances the result of a congenital anomaly in the development of both the pulmonary valve and the root creating the conditions for further development of a pulmonary artery aneurysm.
Whilst minor forms are usually asymptomatic, they can lead to lethal complications in huge sizes and are frequently associated via pulmonary valve insufficiency to right ventricular dysfunction.
This specific association is discussed and a diagnostic algorithm for nosologic classification and management is proposed.
OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to evaluate how performance is defined, conceptualized, and measured in mental health and addiction service systems around the world.
METHOD
We conducted a systematic scoping review of English-language scientific and gray literature published from 2005 to 2015. Eligible documents (n = 222) described performance measurement systems and outlined the theory or empirical evidence for indicators.
We used a structured approach for data extraction and descriptive and thematic analysis, supplemented with stakeholder consultation.
RESULTS
We identified seven themes in the literature: similarity in performance domains across frameworks; the ability of frameworks to inform care quality at client, program/facility, and system levels; the predominance of indicators of process and outcome, over structure; the lack of evidence on the links between domains and/or indicators; common, but limited, evaluation of family/caregiver involvement; equity as a cross-cutting domain of performance; and limited attention to performance measurement in peer support services.
CONCLUSIONS
The literature on performance measurement in mental health and addictions services is vast, and a wide variety of indicators is available to those designing a measurement system.
Evaluations of commonly used performance indicators have yielded mixed evidence on their ability to discriminate high- and low-performing service providers, and their sensitivity to changes in policies and practices.
As performance measurement efforts grow in scope and complexity, work will be needed to ensure that indicators are fair, appropriate, and suited to support quality improvement in services of different types.
Title
Factors influencing medical specialists' dual practice in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Background
Dual practice (DP) is performing several different jobs at the same time and has effects on healthcare services delivery.
Aims
To identify the causes of medical specialists' tendency towards DP in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Methods
We used a qualitative approach to identify the factors affecting DP in medical specialists in 2016. We used a purposive and outlier sampling method to conduct semistructured deep interviews with 14 key informants.
The data analysis was performed simultaneously with data collection using thematic content analysis by MAXQDA (version 10.0).
Interviews continued up to data saturation.
The quality of the study was ensured by addressing the criteria of Guba and Lincoln.
Results
The results of the interviews showed six themes and 16 subthemes for specialists' propensity to DP. Major themes included financial incentives, cultural attitudes about professional identity of physicians, experience and academic level of specialists, controlling approaches in the public sector, available infrastructure for responding to the population needs in the public sector, and regional characteristics of health service locations.
Conclusions
Medical specialists' DP is a multidimensional issue, influenced by different factors such as financial incentives, cultural attitudes and available infrastructure.
Considering the capacities and conditions of each country, control and management of this phenomenon require regulatory and incentive mechanisms, which in the long term can modify private and public sector differences and increase the willingness of doctors to work in the public sector.
Abstract
Handicap related to blindness.
The interest of vision professionals in visual impairment is recent, dating back to the early 1990s. This interest led to the creation in 1996 of the French society for low-vision patients, ARIBa.
The epidemiological figures remain unclear, but the number of people in France with visual disabilities is around one million, together with the major public health concern of age-related macular degeneration and the risk of dependence of the elderly in activities of daily living.
This is a major medical and social, but also economic concern.
Other causes of visual impairment remain numerous, despite advances in the means of prevention and medical or surgical treatment.
Moreover, the investment in basic and clinical research raises high expectations for the decades to come.
It should be noted that despite the development of rehabilitation facilities, in which the French school for low-vision patients has particularly been active, the territorial network of rehabilitation responses to visual impairment remains extremely inadequate and unequal.

Abstract
In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, dogs are the main reservoir for rabies.
In this region, rabies affects more domestic carnivores (50% of cases) than farm animals (40% of cases).
Rabies in large livestock animals, which are infected mainly by dogs, results in economic losses, undermines food safety and poses a risk for humans.
In the MENA region, rabies is largely an urban problem, the virus being transmitted to humans by free-roaming dogs, 30% of which are less than one year old.
In cities, the density of the free-roaming dog population varies between 0.6 and 1.5 dogs per km2, and almost double this figure in suburban and rural areas, where 80% of canine rabies cases occur.
In the Maghreb, the annual average number of confirmed human deaths from rabies is around 47, showing a strong correlation with the number of animal cases declared (approximately 1,442 cases a year).
In the Middle East, only a few rabies cases in humans are officially reported, suggesting that rabies cases in humans are grossly underreported.
National strategies to control rabies include vaccination, controlling the freeroaming dog population and raising awareness among the human population at risk.
Owing to limited resources and poor coordination between the different stakeholders, these strategies are only partially implemented.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in close collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the World Health Organization, supports countries in formulating and implementing coordinated strategies between the ministries concerned, local authorities and non-governmental organisations.
Background
The Limberg flap reconstruction and the Karydakis flap reconstruction are the 2 most used off-midline closure techniques in pilonidal sinus surgery.
The current evidence is inconclusive as to which is the optimal technique.
The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare differences in outcomes between these 2 flap-based techniques.
Methods
We identified studies by a systematic literature search of the Embase, MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases and studies selected as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist.
Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the Limberg flap (standard or modified) and the Karydakis flap were included in this review.
Results
Operative time was shorter by 7 minutes in the Karydakis group than in the Limberg group (mean difference 7.00 min, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53 to 13.48).
The seroma formation rate was significantly higher in the Karydakis cohort (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.56); however, after excluding studies with a high risk of bias, the sensitivity analysis showed no significant differences in seroma formation rate between the 2 techniques (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85).
Other outcomes of interest showed no significant differences between the Limberg and Karydakis techniques.
Conclusion
There were no significant differences between the Limberg and Karydakis techniques.
Future RCTs with strict adherence to CONSORT guidelines will further elucidate the efficacy of these surgical procedures.
Abstract
The therapy for LT is easy but the diagnosis remains a challenge for the pathologist and the laryngologist because of the absence of specific signs.
The objective was to analyze the epidemiological and pathological profiles of LT cases in Dakar (Senegal) with a view to better understand this pathology.
This study was a retrospective and descriptive of LT cases diagnosed in pathology laboratories in Senegal during five years (2011-2015).
The LT was found in 9 cases.
The mean age at diagnosis was 41.9 years (18/58) without sex predominance (sex-ratio = 0.8).
Tobacco intoxication (3/9), tuberculosis contagion (1/9), HIV immunodepression (2/9), and diabetes (1/9) were the various risk factors found.
Dysphonia was a constant symptom (9/9) associated with dysphagia (2/9) and cervical adenopathy (1/9).
The macroscopic presentation was tumoral-like (7/9) and erythematosus and fibrinoid (2/9).
The LT was of glottic seat in all the cases (9/9) with participation on top-glottic in two of the cases.
The biopsy was performed in all patients. It reported tuberculous granuloma in four cases (4/9), tuberculoid granuloma in one case (1/9), and chronic lymphocytic laryngitis in four cases (4/9).
The diagnosis of LT requires a high collaboration between the laryngologist and the pathologist.
Abstract
New drugs available in a click, plethora of games, new regulations on cannabis, addiction medicine has a lot to do !
In 2018, Switzerland recognized a training certificate in addiction medicine, pathological gambling entered into ICD-11 and vaping, first considered with suspicion, found a place in the pharmacopoeia of the fight against tobacco.
That's not all, on the alcohol front, we realized that even a small glass can hurt and the medicine of addictions evolved towards models of recovery that aim to improve quality of life with chronic diseases.
Finally, the American opioid prescription epidemic is worrying in Switzerland, even if the situation and the context are very different.
Problem
Both sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the incidence of obesity have increased in the Philippines in recent years.
Approach
A proposal to tax sugar-sweetened beverages was introduced in the House of Representatives and merged into a proposed comprehensive Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Bill to increase the likelihood of acceptance.
The health department and finance department recommended a policy that would maximize benefits to both public health and government revenue.
To advance discussions, the health department expanded the health argument to include the country's poor performance in oral health.
The approved TRAIN Law adopted the term sweetened beverage to emphasize that the tax covers both sugar and non-sugar sweetened beverages.
The tax rate was set to 6.00 Philippine pesos (0.111 United States dollars) per litre of sweetened beverages.
The sugar industry successfully lobbied for higher tax rates on beverages containing high-fructose corn syrup, resulting in a differential rate of 12.00 Philippine pesos per litre.
Local setting
Despite a 12% value-added tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, sales had been sustained by enhanced marketing and product variants being offered in small portions.
Relevant changes
One month after implementation of the tax in 1 January 2018, prices of taxable sweetened beverages had increased by 16.6 to 20.6% and sales in sari-sari (convenience) stores had declined 8.7%.
Lessons learnt
The tax benefited from high-level government commitment and support, keeping policy simple reduced opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, and taking both health and non-health considerations into account were helpful in arguing for the tax.
Objective
To evaluate a project that integrated essential primary health-care services into the oral polio vaccine programme in hard-to-reach, underserved communities in northern Nigeria.
Methods
In 2013, Nigeria's polio emergency operation centre adopted a new approach to rapidly raise polio immunity and reduce newborn, child and maternal morbidity and mortality.
We identified, trained and equipped eighty-four mobile health teams to provide free vaccination and primary-care services in 3176 hard-to-reach settlements.
We conducted cross-sectional surveys of women of childbearing age in households with children younger than 5 years, in 317 randomly selected settlements, pre- and post-intervention (March 2014 and November 2015, respectively).
Findings
From June 2014 to September 2015 mobile health teams delivered 2 979 408 doses of oral polio vaccine and dewormed 1 562 640 children younger than 5 years old; performed 676 678 antenatal consultations and treated 1 682 671 illnesses in women and children, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria.
The baseline survey found that 758 (19.6%) of 3872 children younger than 5 years had routine immunization cards and 690/3872 (17.8%) were fully immunized for their age.
The endline survey found 1757/3575 children (49.1%) with routine immunization cards and 1750 (49.0%) fully immunized.
Children vaccinated with 3 or more doses of oral polio vaccine increased from 2133 (55.1%) to 2666 (74.6%).
Households' use of mobile health services in the previous 6 months increased from 509/1472 (34.6%) to 2060/2426(84.9%).
Conclusion
Integrating routine primary-care services into polio eradication activities in Nigeria resulted in increased coverage for supplemental oral polio vaccine doses and essential maternal, newborn and child health interventions.
Background
Depression and anxiety are common and underrecognized in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), are associated with poor outcomes and reduced health-related quality of life, and are potentially treatable.
Simple, accurate screening tools are needed.
Objective
We examined the operating characteristics of single questions for anxiety and depression from the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in hemodialysis.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Two outpatient hemodialysis units (1 tertiary, 1 community) in Hamilton, Canada.
Patients
Adult prevalent hemodialysis patients.
Measurements
ESAS and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Methods
Participants were asked the degree to which they experienced anxiety and depression using the ESAS.
ESAS single questions for anxiety and depression were compared with the reference standard of the HADS using dialysis population specific cutoffs (HADS anxiety subscale ≥6 and HADS depression subscale ≥7).
Logistic regression was used to create receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.
Results
We recruited 50 participants with a mean age of 64 (SD = 12.4) years, of whom 52% were male and 96% were on ≥3× weekly hemodialysis.
Using the reference standards, 28 (56%) had a diagnosis of anxiety and 27 (54%) had a diagnosis of depression.
Areas under the ROC curves were 0.83 for anxiety and 0.81 for depression using ESAS scores of ≥2.
Limitations
Sample size and the lack of a reference gold standard.
Conclusions
The ESAS single questions for anxiety and depression have reasonable discrimination in a hemodialysis population.
The use of more complex and time-consuming screening instruments could be reduced by adopting the ESAS questions for anxiety and depression in hemodialysis.
Abstract
Despite tremendous therapeutic innovations during the last decade, the prognosis of metastatic melanoma remains uncertain.
Adjuvant therapy following resection of high-risk melanoma is currently under intense investigation.
Both small-molecules targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, initially developed for metastatic disease, have proven to be efficient in the adjuvant setting in phase 3 trials. The results of this research are already considered as practice-changing.
In this article we summarize this ongoing clinical research and its consequences for the practical management of high-risk melanoma patients.
Abstract
The Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (previously algodystrophy) is a rare affliction that usually affects a distal extremity (hand, foot).
It occurs most frequently within weeks following a traumatic injury or stroke.
It is a syndromic entity whose diagnosis is based on precise criteria, known as the Budapest criteria, excluding any disease that better explains the symptoms.
The treatment must be given early.
Functional restoration (physiotherapy, occupational therapy) is at the heart of the treatment, along with psychoeducation.
Inappropriate disuse and avoidance, often encountered, must be combated.
Bisphosphonates or steroids are first-line drugs at early stages.
The evolution is often long, but the prognosis is favorable in about 75 % of cases (≤ 1 year).
INTRODUCTION
Based on self-determination theory, the Children's Intrinsic Needs Satisfaction Scale (CINSS) measures autonomy, competence and relatedness at school, home and with peers.
The factor structure and criterion-related validity of the CINSS in the Canadian youth population are tested using data from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS).
METHODS
Data from the 2014/2015 CSTADS were analyzed for evidence of convergent and discriminant validity and for method variance.
A multitrait multimethod (MTMM) confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to account for the conceptual structure of the measure.
Criterion-related validity was demonstrated through correlations between related constructs, prosocial behaviours and behavioural problems, and the CINSS subscale scores.
Mean differences on CINSS subscale scores between those who reported and did not report being bullied or bullying others were also examined.
RESULTS
Correlation analyses demonstrated that, in general, correlations were higher between concept/context item pairs and lowest between items measuring different concepts and contexts.
Cronbach's alpha for concept and context subscales were high: α = 0.77 for autonomy, α = 0.85 for competence and α = 0.79 for relatedness.
A MTMM CFA demonstrated that the model fit the data well, with no modifications.
Criterion-related validity was demonstrated through correlations between CINSS subscales and related concepts or mean differences on CINSS subscales between groups.
CONCLUSION
The CINSS demonstrates good internal consistency, factorial validity and criterion-related validity in this sample of Canadian students.
The measurement of positive mental health among Canadian youth is central to surveillance efforts which will help inform mental health promotion activities across Canada.

The role of the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator triple therapy, including a long acting ß2-agonist (LABA), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), in the prevention of the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is still not clearly established, and requires comparison with dual therapy (LABA-CSI or LABA-LAMA).
IMPACT is a phase 3, double-blind randomized study comparing the tritherapy (LABA-LAMA-ICS) in a single inhaler (vilanterol 25 ?g/umeclidinium 62.5 ?g/fluticasone furoate 100 ?g) with the LABA-ICS association (vilanterol 25 ?g-fluticasone furoate 100 ?g) and the combination LABA-LAMA (vilanterol 25 ?g/umeclidinium 62.5 ?g) on the reduction of the rate of exacerbation as the primary outcome, but also on the pulmonary function, the quality of life, the dyspnea and the mortality.
Triple therapy by comparison with dual therapy (LABA-ICS or LABA-LAMA) improves numerous parameters such as the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations, the symptoms, the respiratory function, the quality of life, while being well tolerated.
Finally, the IMPACT study gives an "evidence base" for the GOLD guidelines proposing triple therapy in symptomatic COPD patients presenting exacerbations despite dual therapy.
Abstract
Technological advances in ophthalmology are becoming more and more important.
New imaging instruments and software analysis allow ultra-wide field visualization of the retina non-invasively.
This creates important clinical advantages for an aging population affected by chronic pathologies such as cataract, age related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. In particular, it will be possible to organize screening programs and an individualized approach and follow up of the patients.
While new retinal implants are under development a new drug is now available for the treatment of corneal scars.
Abstract
Originating from South-East Asian tropical forests, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a mosquito of great genetic plasticity, which allowed it to adapt to a large variety of environments including the urban ones.
Yet many a city nowadays comprises peri urban zones close to land devoted to farming.
The sites where Ae. albopictus live and reproduce, located on the fringe of nectarfilled blossoming crops (orchards, colza and sunflower fields) are often polluted by chemical inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides.
In this laboratory study we have assessed the impact of sugar-supplemented solutions contaminated by NPK fertilizer and/or by diflubenzuron or pyriproxyfen insecticides on adults of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes.
The results have shown that the females feeding on a sweetened solution containing NPK fertilizer laid a significantly greater number of eggs.
However when the sweetened solutions contained diflubenzuron or pyriproxyfen insecticides, the actions of both combinations resulted in a noticeable reduction of the numbers of eggs laid and the ones hatching.
Finally when the sweetened solutions had been jointly polluted by the fertilizer and either one of the larvicides, the sterilizing effect of the insecticides was completely obliterated regarding both the numbers of eggs laid and the ones hatching.
We are led to conclude that the somewhat inconsistent use of pesticides and fertilizers in agriculture bring about new ecological systems favorable to the proliferation of mosquitoes.
OBJECTIVE
We previously reported that a chemically resistant structure is present at the interface between the cuticle and the cortex of human hair.
The goal of this study was to identify the position of that structure and to clarify its barrier ability.
METHODS
Untreated, partially and completely decuticled hair fibres were characterized.
The correlation between the number of cuticle layers and the penetration depth of a dye into the cortex was microscopically investigated.
In addition, similar measurements were performed using hair with a denatured cell membrane complex.
RESULTS
The penetration depth of the dye into the cortex showed no statistically significant correlation with the number of cuticle layers in the case of partially decuticled hair fibres (the number of cuticle layers ranged from one to four).
Penetration of the dye proceeded drastically just when the last cuticle layer was lost, but denaturation of the cell membrane complex did not affect the depth of penetration.
That suggested that the penetration barrier at the interface between the cuticle and the cortex is not the cell membrane complex, but rather is the resistant structure previously reported.
It was observed that a thin layer structure is located beneath the endocuticle of the innermost cuticle cell layer, only in the range where the cuticle borders the cortex.
It is thought that this is the structure in question.
CONCLUSION
These results demonstrate that a highly resistant structure located at the interface between the cuticle and the cortex of human hair acts as a penetration barrier.
We propose that structure be named CARB, cuticle anchored resistant base.
Abstract
The lack of reliable data concerning the number of human deaths from rabies presents one of the principal difficulties in a realistic assessment of the importance of this disease, and this lack of an accurate assessment has led to its underestimation and neglect.
Priority should therefore be given to establishing a diagnostic test that can confirm human rabies on the basis of biological results.
Indeed, only a laboratory diagnosis can properly identify infection, because clinical diagnosis remains difficult to interpret and is insufficiently specific.
Historically, diagnosis has been based solely on post-mortem analysis of a cerebral biopsy using immunofluorescence techniques.
Although this remains the standard method, considerable progress has been made with the advent of new molecular techniques and the evaluation of new, less-invasive sampling methods that are more easily accepted by the patient's family.
Intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies is now possible using reliable, robust, validated techniques that can be used everywhere, including in regions with limited resources, using minimally invasive or non-invasive sampling (such as saliva or skin biopsies).
In practice, one of the major challenges with the diagnosis of human rabies is still the transfer and accessibility of such validated techniques in centralised reference laboratories located in low-income enzootic countries, in order to achieve the biological confirmation of each suspected case of rabies.
At the same time, it is necessary to develop easy, fast and low-cost diagnostic methods that can be used in rural and remote areas in peripheral laboratories, or ideally at the patient's bedside.
Background
Outcomes in liver transplantation with organs obtained via donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) have been suboptimal compared to donation after brain death, attributed mainly to the high incidence of ischemic cholangiopathy (IC).
We evaluated the effect of a 10-year learning curve on IC rates among DCD liver graft recipients at a single centre.
Methods
We analyzed all DCD liver transplantation procedures from July 2006 to July 2016. Patients were grouped into early (July 2006 to June 2011) and late (July 2011 to July 2016) eras. Those with less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded.
Primary outcomes were IC incidence and IC-free survival rate.
Results
Among the 73 DCD liver transplantation procedures performed, 70 recipients fulfilled the selection criteria, 32 in the early era and 38 in the late era.
Biliary complications were diagnosed in 19 recipients (27%).
Ischemic cholangiopathy was observed in 8 patients (25%) in the early era and 1 patient (3%) in the late era (p = 0.005).
The IC-free survival rate was higher in the late era than the early era (98% v. 79%, p = 0.01).
The warm ischemia time (27 v. 24 min, p = 0.049) and functional warm ischemia time (21 v. 17 min, p = 0.002) were significantly lower in the late era than the early era.
Conclusion
We found a significant reduction in IC rates and improvement in ICfree survival among DCD liver transplantation recipients after a learning curve period  that was marked by more judicious donor selection with shorter procurement times.
Abstract
The study was conducted on 30 patients (24 males and 6 females) with 32 soft tissue defects of the fingertip treated in emergency plastic surgery with local pedicled flap at the Plastic Surgery Department of Saint Paul Hospital Hanoi from 01/2016 to 06/2017.
The most common cause of injury (21/30) was occupational accidents.
At the time of the accident, 12 patients did not have personal protective equipment (PPE).
Among 18 patients who had one, eight had incomplete equipment.
Of 32 implanted skin flaps, 31 survived completely without necrosis or infection, only one being affected by epidermolysis.
Postoperative evaluation showed excellent motor skills for 31/32 fingers and a sensitivity restoration at S4 level for 27/32. Covering the fingers soft tissue defects with local pedicled flap in emergency preserves the fine motor function and the delicated tactile sensation of the fingers.
Abstract
The Indian subcontinent comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
In all of these countries, except the Maldives, rabies is endemic.
An estimated 59,000 people die from rabies each year; 45% of these deaths occur on the Indian subcontinent and approximately 33% take place in India.
The majority of these deaths are attributable to dog bites, and those most affected are children and the poor.
Access to post-exposure prophylaxis is limited and costly, the supply of immunoglobulins and vaccines can be irregular and public awareness of rabies is low.
Moreover, the vaccination of domestic dogs is not widely implemented.
There is a need for increased laboratory capacity and expertise across the continent, as well as better data, improved surveillance and more user-friendly and economical diagnostic tests.
An animal birth control programme has met with mixed success in India.
However, a greater focus on mass dog vaccination could eliminate the disease at its source, reducing the large burden of mortality for at-risk communities.
In this paper, the authors examine the situation in each of the countries on the Indian subcontinent, discuss current needs, obstacles and progress, and examine future strategies, with the objective of eliminating dog-mediated rabies from the subcontinent by 2030.
Background
Despite the widespread use of medication reviews, many older adults are still exposed to the risks of polypharmacy.
Objectives
To quantify and describe the drug therapy problems identified and interventions undertaken by pharmacists before and after implementation (on July 1, 2015) of collaborative medication review for high-risk older adult patients (> 80 years of age).
Methods
A retrospective single-centre pre-post cohort study was conducted between July 1, 2014, and July 31, 2016, to characterize the impact of collaborative medication reviews-consisting of a thorough medication review by a pharmacist and care conferences with the hospitalist and family physician-on prescribing patterns in an Acute Care for Elders unit.
A standardized template was used to conduct medication reviews for the post-implementation group, whereas a chart review was conducted for the pre-implementation group.
The primary outcomes were the number of drug therapy problems identified by the clinical pharmacists and the associated interventions by the pharmacists, which were categorized as clinical or compliance interventions.
Secondary outcomes included the number of medications at discharge, the rate of hospital readmission within 30 days, and the length of hospital stay.
Results
A total of 137 patients were identified for inclusion in either the pre-implementation group (n = 70) or the post-implementation group (n = 67).
After implementation of collaborative medication reviews, there were statistically significant increases in the mean number of drug therapy problems identified (p < 0.001), the mean number of interventions undertaken (p = 0.004), and the median length of hospital stay (p < 0.001).
There was no difference between the 2 groups in the number of medications at discharge, the proportion of patients taking more than 5 medications at discharge, or readmission within 30 days.
Conclusion
At the study institution, implementation of a quality improvement program that included pharmacist-led medication reviews and collaborative care conferences involving community and hospital care providers helped to improve documentation by clinical pharmacists of potential medication-related problems and led to more interventions to optimize patients' medication regimens.
Background
Although recent progress in cancer treatment has increased patient survival and improved quality of life, reproductive side effects are still for concern.
One way to decrease gonadal impairment is to use cytoprotectors.
In testicular cancer, etoposide is generally used in combination with other agents, but there are no in-vitro studies of sperm exposure to etoposide and cytoprotectors, namely N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
Methods
Twenty semen samples were individually divided into five groups: control, incubation with NAC alone, incubation with etoposide alone, sequential exposure of NAC followed by etoposide (pre-treatment) and sequential exposure of etoposide followed by NAC (post-treatment).
Sperm characteristics, chromatin condensation (aniline blue), DNA fragmentation (TUNEL), oxidative stress (OxyDNA labelling) and glutathione quantification were used to evaluate the capabilities of NAC as a prophylactic (pre-treatment) or ameliorator (post-treatment) agent over the effects caused in sperm during in-vitro exposure to etoposide.
Results
No deleterious effects were observed on sperm motility or sperm membrane integrity.
Results revealed that prophylactic use of NAC (pre-treatment) increased rates of immature sperm chromatin as compared to ameliorator use of NAC (post-treatment), and increased rates of sperm DNA fragmentation in relation to controls.
Pre and post-treatment with NAC increased oxidative levels in comparison to controls, but also increased levels of cellular antioxidant glutathione.
Conclusions
The results indicate that NAC has the ability to counteract etoposide-induced toxicity rather than preventing the etoposide cytotoxic effects over sperm DNA, suggesting that the administration of NAC to cells formerly exposed to etoposide is preferable to its prophylactic use.
As the results evidenced that NAC seems to be more efficient in attenuating sperm etoposide cytotoxic effects instead of being used as a chemoprophylactic agent, this reinforces the idea that there might be a new NAC mechanism over DNA.
Abstract
The most frequent dialysis modality in Switzerland is hemodialysis.
Patients need a proper vascular access for this modality. There are three types of vascular access for hemodialysis : arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous graft and central venous catheters.
In this article, we will discuss the most important parameters that need to be taken into account when choosing the most appropriate access.
We present the advantages and disadvantages of each vascular access, as well as their main local (thrombosis, infection, steal syndrome) and systemic (heart failure, pulmonary hypertension) complications, which may also be encountered by primary care physicians.
Title
Knowledge by physicians concerning cervical cancer and testing: Benimellal province, Morocco.
Background
Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women after skin cancer.
Aims
This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge of general practitioners with regard to cervical cancer in the province of Benimellal, Morocco.
Methods
A cross-sectional study using a self-reported questionnaire given to 71 general practitioners operating in public and private healthcare centres in the province of Benimellal.
Results
Almost half of general practitioners (49.3%) were not aware of a national plan for the prevention and control of cancer in Morocco, and only 18.2% gave a correct response on the incidence rate for cervical cancer. The human papilloma virus as the principle risk factor was identified by 21% of general practitioners.
Conclusions
The knowledge of general practitioners was deficient and therefore initial and continuing training on cervical cancer is required.
Abstract
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) regional vaccine banks are established for priority diseases, following a business model that depends largely on financial support from donors (with vaccine also purchased directly by individual countries and international organisations that have been granted access by the OIE to the mechanism), and is based on the concept of starting small and scaling up.
The OIE vaccine bank for rabies was established in 2012 with a first production order of just 50,000 doses, but as of 31 December 2016, after five years, the OIE had ordered almost 16 million doses of rabies vaccines for deliveries in 24 countries.
It was set up on the basis of OIE internationally recognised procurement procedures and the outcome of an international call for tender.
Vaccine manufacturers are contracted to produce and supply high-quality vaccine on demand, but they also keep vaccines available at any moment so that they can deliver small quantities of vaccines for emergencies.
Abstract
In this article, a synthesis of data from the literature on postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to childbirth is presented, knowing that the psychological suffering in this period of life is frequently associated with a certain taboo.
The criteria to diagnose psychotraumatism, as well as postpartum PTSD just after the birth are here recalled as well as the importance of evaluating the subjective experience of the mother wich is a central issue.
The clinical specificity and key symptoms of postpartum PTSD are described along with the risk and protective factors.
In the light of scientific knowledge in the field of psychotraumatology, we present the prevention strategies of this disorder that can be applied, but which remain to be evaluated and tailored to this specific context.
Abstract
Rabies is a global issue, and kills tens of thousands of people every year, despite being a preventable disease. The goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) to eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030 requires serious collaborative efforts across Ministries and countries.
This cross-sector cooperation includes, but is not limited to, physicians, veterinarians, local authorities, local communities and the media; in other words, a 'One Health' approach. Countries where human rabies has been successfully eliminated still require constant vigilance, in terms of regulations on companion animal ownership and vaccination, the movement of animals from countries where the disease still exists, and the continued raising of public awareness.
Rabies-endemic countries need to refocus their efforts towards eliminating the disease once and for all, by working together and sharing their knowledge, experiences and efforts.
Rabies control programmes require the efficient management of resources, and surveillance programmes do not need to be specific to one disease.
Governments must play a more proactive role by enforcing legislation and allocating funds and resources to help to eliminate human rabies by 2030 throughout the world.
Abstract
Major advances in the treatment of ANCA associated-renal vasculitides, IGA nephropathy and renal autosomal dominant polycystic disease were published within the past year.
There is neither clear benefit of early initiation of renal replacement therapy in the intensive care unit nor with the use of chloride-poor solutions to prevent kidney failure.
Maintenance parenteral iron supplementation in hemodialysis patients is neither associated with infectious nor cardiovascular risks.
Cognitive decline may be more associated with hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis.
In transplantation, the persistence of complement-binding donor-specific antibodies after treatment is predictor of graft loss.
Tocilizumab is a promising treatment for chronic antibody-mediated rejection.
Title
Physicians' retention rate and its effective factors in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Background
Migration of physicians from less developed countries to affluent ones has become as one of the major concerns of human resource policy-makers.
This leads to problems such as inequity in the distribution of physicians, lack of physicians in less developed areas, as well as an excess of the health workforce in developed environs.
Thus, policy-makers aim to increase retention of physicians in their places of origin.
Aims
This study aimed to find those effective factors for the retention of physicians in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Methods
30 569 records of public sector physicians in 2016 were gathered from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education database, and the retention rate of each province was calculated.
Geographic information system (GIS) was used to show retention in each province, and linear and logistic regression analysis were used to determine the effective factors for physicians' retention in the country.
Results
There was a significant relationship between per capita gross domestic product of each province and its retention rate of physicians (OR = 1.56), retention rate of family physicians (OR = 7.38), and retention rate of specialists (OR = 1.59).
In addition, relationships were significant for the human development index (all physicians [OR = 1.22], family physicians [OR = 2.36], and specialists [OR = 1.23]).
Married physicians, higher paid physicians, and those who worked in headquarters and clinics showed greater willingness to stay in their area of origin.
Conclusions
Physicians' retention rate is dependent on both macro and microlevel factors.
Abstract
For a long time there has been a debate in Switzerland as to whether the veterinary farm animal service is still sufficiently guaranteed.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the supply and demand of veterinary services for cattle and pigs through a representative survey of veterinarians and farmers.
The results revealed that the veterinary farm animal service was rated by the majority of both, farmers and veterinarians, to be good or very good.
Veterinary service shortages exist partly in mountain and peripheral regions, in small areas in otherwise well-served regions and in the canton of Ticino.
By contrast, about one third of farm animal practices are rather underutilized and would prefer to increase livestock numbers.
The emergency service is currently very well guaranteed.
Ninety-five percent of veterinarians and farmers stated that on-site emergency service is provided within an hour or less.
The quality of veterinary services were also assessed positively by the farmers.
While a third of respondents said veterinary care improved compared to five years ago, only two percent felt that veterinary care had deteriorated.
Almost all veterinarians stated that vacancies in farm animal practices were difficult to fill adequately.
The majority of practice owners do not receive enough applications from suitable candidates.
In addition, the majority of applicants were not trained in Switzerland.
The security of farm animal veterinary service is currently mostly good to very well guaranteed.
However, there is a lack of veterinarians trained to meet the future needs of farm animal veterinarians.
Title
Successful implementation of general health policies in the Islamic Republic of Iran: barriers and mechanisms.
Background
The general health policies for the Islamic Republic of Iran were approved in April 2014.
Aims
This study examined the barriers currently faced by general health policies and the mechanisms required for the successful implementation of these polices.
Methods
This qualitative study was conducted as a two-phase project based on standard CAN-IMPLEMENT guidelines.
A set of qualitative methods, including face-to-face in-depth interviews, focus groups, and in-person consensus meetings, were used to clarify mechanisms and barriers.
Results
Twenty-one mechanisms and 13 barriers were identified.
The majority of mechanisms were related to the development of health infrastructures and appropriate allocation of resources.
The most significant barriers to implementation of general health policies were lack of formulated strategies, poor management, lack of a comprehensive national action plan, minimal information infrastructures, and inadequate funding.
Conclusions
A thorough understanding of barriers and mechanisms for implementation of general health policies can provide the necessary background to ensure successful health promotion in the country.
Title
Yemen field epidemiology training programme: a tool for strengthening the public health workforce.
Background
The shortage of skilled public health workers, especially epidemiologists, remains an important challenge for building effective public health systems in many low-income countries, including Yemen.
To address this need, in 2011 the Ministry of Public Health and Population established the Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Programme (Y-FETP).
Aims
To describe the Y-FETP and its strengths and challenges in addressing Yemen's National Health System (NHS) needs.
Methods
We describe the structure and functions of the Y-FETPs and analyse the achievements and challenges of the first 7 years of programme implementation as they relate to the NHS.
Results
The Y-FETP is a postgraduate competency-based training with the objective of strengthening capacity in field epidemiology so that events of public health importance can be detected and investigated in a timely and effective manner.
Since its establishment, the Y-FETP has successfully trained 30 health professionals in advanced field epidemiology.
Furthermore, trainees investigated over 100 outbreaks, analysed and evaluated 95 surveillance systems, conducted 30 planned studies and presented 70 oral and poster presentations at national and international conferences.
The main challenges are low retention of graduates by the NHS and financial unsustainability.
Conclusions
The Y-FETP has strengthened the capacity of the Yemen health workforce and has been instrumental in supporting the NHS, especially during the war and the current crisis and health emergency as the security situation deteriorated and access to outside experts becomes limited.
The programme provides a practical example of health systems strengthening through health workforce capacity development that can be replicated in countries with similar health workforce capacity challenges.
