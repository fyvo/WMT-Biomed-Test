Background
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare condition typically affecting women with obesity who are of child-bearing age.
Patients commonly present with headaches, visual disturbances, pulsatile tinnitus and papilledema.
The association between IIH and obesity has been well established in the literature, suggesting that weight loss may contribute to improving IIH.
For patients with severe obesity for whom conservative management is not successful, bariatric surgery is an effective modality for weight loss.
We aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the efficacy of bariatric surgery in the treatment of IIH
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science (limited to studies in humans published in English between January 1946 and July 2015).
Results
Twelve primary studies (n = 39 patients) were included in the systematic review.
All patients had a preoperative diagnosis of IIH.
Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 47.4 ± 3.6 kg/m2; BMI improved to 33.7 ± 2.1 kg/2 and 33.9 ± 11.6 kg/2 at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, respectively.
Lumbar puncture opening pressures decreased from 34.4 ± 6.9 cm H2O to 14.0 ± 3.6 cm H2O after surgery.
Common symptoms of IIH improved after bariatric surgery: headaches (100% preoperatively v. 10% postoperatively), visual complaints (62% v. 44%), tinnitus (56% v. 3%) and papilledema (62% v. 8%).
Conclusion
Bariatric surgery appears to lead to considerable improvement in IIH.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is not a well-publicized comorbidity of obesity, but its presence may be considered as an indication for bariatric surgery.
Background
Few studies have compared the surgical results of single-incision robotic cholecystectomy (SIRC) with those of conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC).
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative clinical efficacy of SIRC by comparing the number of postoperative days, pain level and complications between the 2 surgical methods.
Methods
We retrospectively collected demographic, perioperative and postoperative data for all patients who underwent SIRC or CLC performed by a single surgeon from June 2016 to May 2017.
Operative time was recorded, divided into anesthesia time, docking time, console time and total operation time.
Postoperative pain was measured with the Numerical Pain Rating Scale.
Results
A total of 121 patients underwent cholecystectomy during the study period, of whom 61 had SIRC and 60 had CLC.
The mean total operation time of SIRC and CLC was 93.52 (SD 20.27) minutes and 37.67 (SD 19.73) minutes, respectively (p < 0.001).
The total operation time excluding console time of SIRC was significantly longer than that of CLC (82.77 [SD 18.27] min v. 37.67 [SD 19.73] min) (p < 0.001).
The mean Numerical Pain Rating Scale score was 4.73 (SD 1.23) (SIRC: 4.75 [SD 1.24]; CLC: 4.70 [SD 1.22]) (p = 0.8) within 1 hour after the operation; scores after 6 hours and 1 day decreased in a similar manner in the 2 groups (p = 0.1).
Conclusion
Postoperative pain, use of an additional port, complication rates, operation time and cost of SIRC were similar to or greater than those of CLC.
Large randomized controlled trials are needed to examine the true benefits of SIRC.
Abstract
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful procedures in orthopedic surgery.
Nevertheless, postoperative patellofemoral complications remain a challenging problem, affecting a substantial proportion of patients.
Complications involving the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) can occur in both resurfaced and nonresurfaced patellae.
Types of PFJ complications include anterior knee pain, maltracking, fracture, avascular necrosis and patellar clunk.
The causes of patellofemoral complications can be categorized into patient-, surgeon- and implant-related factors.
Patient characteristics such as female sex, young age, depression and increased body mass index have been linked with increased complications.
Important technical considerations to avoid complications include achieving appropriate rotational alignment of the femoral and tibial components, maintaining joint line height, medializing the patellar button and avoiding “overstuffing” the PFJ.
Component design features such as conformity, shape and depth of the femoral trochlea have also been shown to be important.
Although the cause of patellofemoral complications after TKA may sometimes be unknown, it remains important to minimize errors that can lead to these complications.
Title
Study protocol for promoting physical activity among women based on the MAPP process.								
Background
The participation of all stakeholders is necessary when a community-based intervention is designed.
For running a practical intervention, it is necessary to have a framework to design the programme while considering all stages of planning, implementation and evaluation.
Aims
To describe a study protocol based on the MAPP process (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships) for promoting physical activity (PA).
Methods
This protocol is implemented in 6 distinct phases.
The goal of the first and second phase is to organize the programme and increase participation, and to determine the vision of the programme, respectively.
The third phase provides a comprehensive picture of a community.
The fourth and fifth phases identify strategies for the programme.
The sixth phase is about the action cycle.
Conclusion
The framework considers all factors on PA improvement and, consequently, results in a culture-based programme for women.
OBJECTIVE
Maternal anaemia in early pregnancy is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.
Furthermore, preconceptional health can influence the health during pregnancy.
The aim of this study was to investigate which preconceptional factors were associated with haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in early pregnancy.
Methods
In Tanzania, 226 women were followed at preconception and during early pregnancy.
Red blood cell (RBC) morphology, serum micronutrient concentration, demographic characteristics and health status were assessed in preconception and in early pregnancy.
The association between preconceptional factors and Hb concentration in early pregnancy was investigated using simple and multiple linear regression analyses stratified by preconceptional anaemia status.
RESULTS
Mean Hb was 123 and 119 g/l before conception and during early pregnancy (median gestational age 53 days) respectively.
Preconceptional mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (adjusted coefficient (AC) 0.35 95% CI 0.9-0.61) and preconceptional Hb concentration (AC 0.45 95% CI 0.36-0.54) were positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration, whereas preconceptional microcytic hypochromic RBC morphology (AC -6.00 95% CI -9.56 to -2.44) was negatively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration.
In addition, treatment of preconceptional malaria was positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration (AC 6.45 95% CI 0.74-12.2) among women with preconceptional anaemia.
In contrast, among preconceptional non-anaemic women, only preconceptional Hb concentration and medium socio-economic status was positively associated with early pregnancy Hb concentration.
CONCLUSIONS
Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and Hb measurements in preconception can help to detect women at increased risk of low Hb concentration in early pregnancy.
OBJECTIVES
Reduction in maternal and newborn mortality requires that women deliver in high quality health facilities.
However, many facilities provide sub-optimal quality of care, which may be a reason for less than universal facility utilisation.
We assessed the impact of a quality improvement project on facility utilisation for childbirth.
METHODS
In this cluster-randomised experiment in four rural districts in Tanzania, 12 primary care clinics and their catchment areas received a quality improvement intervention consisting of in-service training, mentoring and supportive supervision, infrastructure support, and peer outreach, while 12 facilities and their catchment areas functioned as controls.
We conducted a census of all deliveries within the catchment area and used difference-in-differences analysis to determine the intervention's effect on facility utilisation for childbirth.
We conducted a secondary analysis of utilisation among women whose prior delivery was at home.
We further investigated mechanisms for increased facility utilisation.
RESULTS
The intervention led to an increase in facility births of 6.7 percentage points from a baseline of 72% (95% Confidence Interval: 0.6, 12.8).
The intervention increased facility delivery among women with past home deliveries by 18.3 percentage points (95% CI: 10.1, 26.6).
Antenatal quality increased in intervention facilities with providers performing an additional 0.5 actions across the full population and 0.8 actions for the home delivery subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS
We attribute the increased use of facilities to better antenatal quality.
This increased utilisation would lead to lower maternal mortality only in the presence of improvement in care quality.
Background
While there is a broad spectrum of practice within chiropractic two sub-types can be identified, those who focus on musculoskeletal problems and those who treat also non-musculoskeletal problems.
The latter group may adhere to the old conservative 'subluxation' model.
The main goal of this study is to determine if chiropractic students with such conservative opinions are likely to have a different approach to determine contra-indications, non-indications and indications to chiropractic treatment versus those without such opinions.
Method
An anonymous and voluntary survey on 3rd to 6th year French chiropractic students was conducted between November 2017 and January 2018.
Level of chiropractic conservatism (10 items) and the ability to determine contra-indications (2 cases), non-indications (4 cases) and indications (3 cases) were evaluated through a questionnaire.
Answers to these cases were dichotomized into 'appropriate' and 'inappropriate' answers, as defined by previous research teams and the present team.
The level of conservatism was classified into four groups, 'group 4' corresponding to the highest score.
Descriptive data are provided, and bi- and multivariate analyses were performed through logistic regression to test the associations between the level of conservatism and the ability to determine the suitability of chiropractic treatment.
Results
In all, 359 of 536 (67%) students responded to the questionnaire.
They generally recognized a number of contra-indications and indications to treatment.
However, they found it more difficult to identify non-indications.
The more conservative students were more likely to intend to treat their patients, even if this was irrelevant (non-indications).
For example, those who were most conservative (group 4) were much more willing than those in group 1 to treat 'chiropractically' a 5-year-old child with no history of back pain or disease to prevent future back pain (OR = 14.7) and also to prevent non-musculoskeletal disease (OR = 22).
Conclusion
It is concerning that students who adhere to the subluxation model are prepared to 'operationalize' their conservative opinions in their future scope of practice; apparently willing to treat asymptomatic people with chiropractic adjustments.
The determinants of this phenomenon need to be understood.
OBJECTIVE
Emilin-1 is a versatile protein abundant in tissues where resilience and elastic recoil are prominent and interacting with components of the extracellular matrix.
Still, little is known about Emilin-1 in the skin.
Therefore, we investigated Emilin-1 in the skin, its localization, its fate upon ageing, its interactions with other proteins and the effect of its knockdown.
METHODS
Skin explants from young or old Caucasian women, immunofluorescently labelled by anti-Emilin-1, anti-Fibrillin-1 and anti-Elastin antibodies, were analysed using confocal microscopy.
Skin explants subjected to UV-induced skin ageing were also analysed.
Colocalization of Emilin-1 with Collagen IV, Fibrillin-1 and Elastin was studied by multiphoton microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation.
Finally, the effect of Emilin-1 extinction was studied by producing small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown fibroblasts and by analysing the outcome on selected genes.
RESULTS
In skin sections from young donors, Emilin-1 localizes similarly to Elastin and Fibrillin-1.
In the papillary dermis, it shows clear and ramified structures, perpendicular to the dermo-epidermal junction that are reminiscent of the oxytalan fibres.
In the reticular dermis, Emilin-1 signal appears identical to that of the elastic fibres network.
Upon intrinsic or UV-induced ageing, the signal associated with Emilin-1 is drastically reduced and disorganized.
Multiphoton microscopy study shows that, as expected, Emilin-1 colocalizes with Elastin.
It also colocalizes with Collagen IV in the basement membrane and within dermal fibroblasts.
Interaction of Emilin-1 with Elastin and Collagen IV was also found by co-immunoprecipitation. It also reveals interaction with Laminin-5.
Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EMILIN-1 show little effect on the expression level of the 61 genes we studied.
The most striking change is a downregulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 that show a decrease similar to that of EMILIN-1 itself and after 8 days a downregulation of COL6A1.
CONCLUSION
In skin, Emilin-1 locates in the dermis, up to the basement membrane, interacting with components of the extracellular matrix but also with the anchoring complex.
These interactions are important for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation and would suggest that Emilin-1 might be important for maintaining the 3D structure of the extracellular matrix.
Abstract
Evidence-based home-visiting programs aim to address one of the most important challenges facing our species-setting the next generation on a healthy path of development that prepares them for a future that is simultaneously uncertain and promising.
Diverse research literatures have pointed to practices to effectively meet this challenge and better achieve the unfulfilled promise of home visiting by more effectively engaging parents in supporting their children's early development and well-being.
Measures of home-visit quality practices drawn from social work, pediatric nursing, early childhood, and early intervention research literatures have identified building relationships with families and focusing on their strengths as effective, practices that are particularly important for vulnerable families.
The articles in this special section used the Home Visit Rating Scales to examine stability in home-visit quality over time, study specific home-visiting processes linked with quality, validate a supervisor checklist of home-visiting implementation, and consider the home visit in relation to an array of indicators reflecting overall home-visiting program strength and stability.
These articles exemplify progress in home-visiting research over recent decades, including advances in direct observational methods and measurement as well as examinations of home visiting as an observable process across various home-visiting program models and populations.
Background
A novel symmetric posterior condylar design and option of a femoral component with an outer zirconium oxide layer were introduced to a successful asymmetric condylar total knee arthroplasty system in 2005.
Given the paucity of information on this modified design, we performed a study to determine its early to midterm survivorship and performance.
Methods
Patients who received the Genesis II Symmetric Posterior Condyle or Legion Primary total knee (cobalt–chromium [CoCr] or oxidized zirconium–niobium [OxZr]) (Smith & Nephew) implanted at the study centre between March 2007 and December 2013 were enrolled into a prospective database.
We retrospectively reviewed the database and performed survival analysis using Kaplan–Meier techniques.
Results
There were 2178 patients (1359 women [62.4%]; mean age 64.6 yr; mean body mass index 35.0) with 2815 knee replacements available for analysis.
Survival rates were 98.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.6%–98.7%) for failure for any reason at 2 years and 96.8% (95% CI 96.0%–97.7%) at 5 years.
Age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.997) and female sex (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27–0.75) were protective, whereas body mass index (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99–1.05) and OxZr implant (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.57–2.18) did not influence survivorship.
Oxford Knee Score values improved from a mean of 40.2 to 21.8 by 2 years (p < 0.001), with no difference between the CoCr and OxZr groups.
Conclusion
The symmetric posterior condylar posterior-stabilized knee offers excellent midterm survivorship.
Implant bearing surface did not have an influence on survivorship to 5 years, and, thus, use of OxZr implants may not be justified.
Title
Genetic Analysis of a Large Family with Migraine, Vertigo, and Motion Sickness.
Background
Migraine is a common disorder most typically presenting as headache and often associated with vertigo and motion sickness.
It is a genetically complex condition with multiple genes ultimately contributing to the predisposition and development of this episodic neurological disorder.
We identified a large American family of 29 individuals of which 17 members suffered from at least one of these disorders, migraine, vertigo, or motion sickness.
Many of these individuals suffered from several simultaneously.
Methods
Genome-wide linkage analysis performed using 400 microsatellite repeat markers spaced at 10 cM throughout the genome.
The members of this family were phenotyped for each condition, migraine, vertigo, and motion sickness and analyzed separately.
Statistical analysis was performed using two-point and multipoint linkage analysis employing a number of models including autosomal recessive or dominant patterns of inheritance with high and low genetic penetrance.
RESULTS
We identified a novel locus for migraine, 9q13-q22 (maximum two-point logarithm of odds [LOD] score-2.51).
In addition, there are suggestive LOD scores that localize to different chromosomes for each phenotype; vertigo (chromosome 18, LOD score of 1.82) and motion sickness (chromosome 4, LOD score of 2.09).
CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis supports our hypothesis that the migraine-associated vertigo and motion sickness may involve distinct susceptibility genes.
OBJECTIVE
To estimate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for the treatment of VL in Brazil.
METHODS
Cost-effectiveness study comparing three therapeutic options: meglumine antimoniate (MA), liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) and a combination of LAMB plus MA (LAMB plus MA), from public health system and societal perspectives.
An analytical decision-making model was used to compare strategies for the following outcomes: early therapeutic failure avoided at 30 days, days of hospitalisation avoided and VL cure at 180 days.
The efficacy and safety parameters of the drugs came from a randomised, open-label trial and the cost data came from a cost-of-illness study, both carried out in Brazil.
RESULTS
For all outcomes analysed, the LAMB strategy was more effective.
The MA strategy was inferior to the LAMB plus MA strategy for the outcomes early therapeutic failure avoided and cure.
When only LAMB and MA were compared from a societal perspective, a cost of US$ 278.56 was estimated for each additional early therapeutic failure avoided, a cost of US$ 26.88 for each additional day of hospitalisation avoided and a cost of US$ 89.88 for each additional case of cured VL, for the LAMB strategy vs. MA.
CONCLUSION
In Brazil, the LAMB strategy proved to be cost-effective for treating VL, considering a GDP per capita as the willingness-to-pay threshold, for all of the outcomes analysed in comparison to MA.
Title
Against the Current: Wilder Penfield, the Frontal Lobes and Psychosurgery.
Abstract
Psychosurgery refers to the surgical interruption of the white matter fibres joining the frontal cortex to the remainder of the cortical mantle and to the thalamus, in an attempt to mitigate the manifestations of psychosis.
It reached its heyday following World War Two and was abandoned with the introduction of major tranquilisers such as chlorpromazine.
Wilder Penfield, unlike most of his contemporaries, had a jaundiced view of psychosurgery.
This paper addresses Penfield's early experience with experimental, penetrating brain trauma and with the surgical resection of frontal, epileptogenic lesions, which explain his antagonism towards psychosurgery.
Abstract
The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of reproductive management practices on fertility in primiparous and multiparous dairy cows and to identify the differences by parity.
Data on reproductive performance and management of cows were gathered from 34 large commercial Holstein-Friesian dairy herds in Hungary.
Individual data on 23 781 cows that calved in the studied herds in 2014 were collected from the national milk recording database and used to calculate the reproductive indices.
Farm managers and veterinarians were interviewed in person from May 22 to November 6, 2015 using a questionnaire to collect information about reproductive management practices.
The data were statistically analyzed by mixed-effects models.
Our results showed that the use of a voluntary waiting period (VWP) was linked to a greater increase in calving-to-conception interval (CCI, P < 0.05) and a greater decline in the chance of pregnancy at 200 days in milk (P200, P < 0.001) in multiparous cows.
Estrus synchronization was related to a larger reduction in days-to-first service (DFS, P < 0.001), breeding interval (IBI, P < 0.05), and CCI (P < 0.01) and a greater improvement in P200 (P < 0.001) in primiparous cows.
Early pregnancy diagnosis and pregnancy recheck improved IBI (P < 0.01 for both practices), CCI (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), and P200 (P < 0.001 for both practices) to a larger extent in primiparous than in multiparous cows.
In conclusion, estrus synchronization, early pregnancy diagnosis, and pregnancy recheck led to a greater improvement in fertility in primiparous cows than in multiparous cows.
OBJECTIVE
To explore some morphological features of the eyebrows of women of different ethnicities and ages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:	Standard digital photographs of 3600 women of six ethnicities, aged 18-84 years, previously used to describe the morphology of the human eyes, allowed us to focus on their eyebrows, as supplementary and opportunistic study.
Photographs of both eyebrows were analysed partly by manual markings and automatically by dedicated algorithms.
Six parameters of the eyebrows were recorded: length, waviness/curvature, oblique aspect, size (vertical height), total surface and hair coverage (density).
RESULTS
Most criteria present ethnic specificities.
These are: length (longer eyebrows of Indian, shorter among African women); waviness where the straighter eyebrows were found among Chinese and Japanese women.
In general, the longer the eyebrows, the higher their waviness and vice versa.
Thickness (or height) of the eyebrows presents a wide ethnic variability as well as hair coverage, where African women present the lower hair density, inversely to Indian women.
The same holds true with regard to the total surface of eyebrows, of a large variability (by about four times).
Some criteria appear more individually dependent than ethnic-specific, such as the oblique positioning, at the exception of Indian women with less oblique eyebrows.
CONCLUSION
The present investigation brings new findings on a scarcely studied facial element, the morphologic features of which are, for most, ethnic-dependent.
As applied consequences, the results of the present work pave the road to better adapt adorning procedures of the eyebrows vis-à-vis ethnic and age specificities.
OBJECTIVE
To explore the relationship between skin surface hydration and Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) when simultaneously measured.
METHODS
Six circular skin areas of the forearms (3 per forearm, 3 cm in diameter) of 12 Caucasian women were used as models.
4 prototypes of formulae of different compositions containing glycerol at different concentrations 7%, 10% and 40% were used as models of hydrating products.
One formula (glycerol-free) was used as control vehicle.
Standardized applications of formulae (2 mg/cm2 ) were performed on 5 skin sites chosen at random, the other being left as bare/control.
A recently marketed instrumental device that records the skin surface hydration and TEWL on a small skin area in a simultaneous manner was used.
Measurements were carried out at T0 (pre-application), at 1 h (T1) and 5 h (T5) post applications on two close sites within the 6 defined areas of both forearms.
RESULTS
The new instrumental device allowed to clearly differentiate the 5 formulae (i.e. 7% vs. 10%) with regard the dose effect brought by glycerol (7%, 10%, 40%) and to record their lingering effects at T1 and T5.
Both parameters were found significantly and negatively correlated, i.e. the higher the skin hydration, the lower the TEWL.
The 40% concentration of glycerol, that leads to the highest skin hydration, brings a drop in the TEWL by about a two-fold factor.
Skin hydration of bare skin and control/vehicle sites showed minor and non-significant changes along 5 h.
Instead, the control/ vehicle slowed down the TEWL to a slight extent.
CONCLUSION
The use of this new instrumental device shed a new light on the mutual and inverse relationships between skin hydration and TEWL.
Results suggest that, at high concentration, glycerol leads to largely increase the water content of both epidermal and dermal compartments, possibly leading to structural changes in the skin relief.
Background
Centralization of specialist services to urban centres presents a challenge to patients living in rural communities.
The hepatopancreatobiliary surgery (HPB) program at Health Sciences North (HSN) is the tenth and newest HPB centre by Cancer Care Ontario and presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the barriers to delivering HPB cancer care to patients in northern Ontario.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients referred to the Northeastern Ontario Cancer Centre and HSN with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis between 2009 and 2015.
July 2013 marked the inception of the HPB surgical program.
Our primary outcome was time to HPB surgical consultation.
Secondary outcomes included distance of travel and time to curative intent operation.
Results
Our population consisted of 207 patients (98 pre-HPB v. 109 post-HPB).
Median time to consultation with an HPB surgeon was decreased in the post-HPB group (43 v. 11 d, p < 0.001).
An increased proportion of patients with pancreatic malignancies in the post-HPB group received HPB surgical consultations (34% v. 74%, p < 0.001), with decreased median distance travelled to surgical consultation (411 v. 79 km, p < 0.001).
Time to curative intent operation or medical oncology consultation did not significantly increase.
Conclusion
A new HPB program appears to have facilitated the proportion of patients with pancreatic malignancies at HSN receiving an HPB surgical consultation.
Patients received complex surgeries, closer to their home regions.
It is anticipated that these changes may affect overall outcomes and patient satisfaction and will be the focus of future investigations.
OBJECTIVE
To understand the importance of authorship and authorship position, and gauge perceptions of inappropriate authorship assignment, among authors publishing paediatric research conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-methods study using an online survey of both corresponding and randomly selected, non-corresponding authors who published research conducted in LMICs from 2006 to 2015 in the top four paediatric journals by Eigenfactor score.
We used chi-square tests to compare responses by authors living in LMICs to authors living in high-income countries (HICs).
We analysed qualitative responses using thematic analysis.
RESULTS
Of 1420 potential respondents, 19.6% (n = 279) completed the survey.
57% (n = 159) lived in LMICs and 43% (n = 120) in HICs.
LMIC authors more commonly perceived first authorship as most important for their academic advancement than HIC authors (74.2% vs. 60.8%, P = 0.017), while HIC authors reported last authorship as most important (25.1% vs. 38.3%, P = 0.018).
65% (n = 181) of respondents believed that their collaborators had been inappropriately assigned authorship positions (no difference in LMIC and HIC responses) and 32.6% (n = 91) reported personally accepting inappropriate authorship positions (more common in HIC respondents, P = 0.005).
In qualitative data, respondents questioned the applicability of standard authorship guidelines for collaborative research conducted in LMICs.
CONCLUSIONS
LMIC and HIC authors held different perceptions about the importance of authorship position.
Reported inappropriate authorship assignment was common among both LMIC and HIC respondents.
Alternatives to standard authorship criteria for research conducted in LMICs merit further studies.
Goal
The purpose of this study is to clarify the magnitude of the association between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and to identify possible moderators of this relationship.
Methods
An extensive literature search was conducted using multiple databases of both published and unpublished studies.
A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment security and to establish the effect size.
Results
The main findings from this meta-analysis, which included 42 studies, indicate that there is a small, yet significant, relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity.
The rate of nonsecurity in infants of mothers with depression was approximately 20% higher than expected rates in a nonclinical population, and the association between depressive symptoms and nonsecurity was small, but significant.
Infants of mothers with depression were nearly twice as likely to have a nonsecure attachment than were infants of healthy mothers.
Depression measure and maternal sample source were identified as significant moderators of the odds ratio effect size.
Conclusions
Results of this study demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between maternal depression and infant attachment nonsecurity, and suggest that interventions that focus on both maternal mental health and the attachment relationship are warranted.
Background
The rate of potential adverse drug events is reported to be 3 times higher among pediatric inpatients than among their adult counterparts.
Various methods have been suggested to reduce medication errors in pediatric patients.
One of the most influential of these strategies is inclusion of a clinical pharmacist on the multidisciplinary care team.
However, there is currently no literature describing the inventory of pharmacy services provided to pediatric patients in Canadian adult hospitals.
Objectives
The primary objective of this study was to describe pediatric and neonatal pharmacy services provided in adult hospitals in Canada.
The secondary objective was to determine whether the services provided correspond to services that pharmacists working in Canadian pediatric hospitals identified as important for adult hospitals that provide pediatric services.
Methods
Two web-based surveys were created, focusing on 35 pharmacy services.
The first survey was intended for adult hospitals, and the second for pediatric hospitals.
The surveys were distributed by e-mail and were completed in January and February 2018.
Results
A total of 55 and 43 valid responses were received from respondents in adult hospitals and pediatric hospitals, respectively.
An inventory of pharmacy services provided by adult hospitals to their pediatric and neonatal patients was obtained.
Of the adult hospitals that responded, 61% (33/54) had pharmacists assigned to pediatric or neonatal units.
The frequency with which most pharmacy services were provided was comparable to the importance identified by pharmacists working in pediatric hospitals.
However, for the provision of education during admission and at discharge and for the provision of medication reconciliation at discharge, frequency and importance were not comparable.
Conclusions
Adult hospitals with a pharmacist assigned to an inpatient pediatric or neonatal clinical area met most expectations of pharmacists working in pediatric hospitals in terms of pharmacy services provided.
However, some services require optimization for this patient population.
Title
Position Statement on the Use of Medical Cannabis for the Treatment of Epilepsy in Canada.
Abstract
In Canada, recreational use of cannabis was legalized in October 2018.
This policy change along with recent publications evaluating the efficacy of cannabis for the medical treatment of epilepsy and media awareness about its use have increased the public interest about this agent.
The Canadian League Against Epilepsy Medical Therapeutics Committee, along with a multidisciplinary group of experts and Canadian Epilepsy Alliance representatives, has developed a position statement about the use of medical cannabis for epilepsy.
This article addresses the current Canadian legal framework, recent publications about its efficacy and safety profile, and our understanding of the clinical issues that should be considered when contemplating cannabis use for medical purposes.
Objective
To improve the low coverage and performance of a programme on community-based management of acute malnutrition, implemented between October 2015 and April 2018 in Kupang district in rural Indonesia.
Methods
To investigate why the coverage and performance were low in the first year of the programme, we conducted a semiquantitative evaluation between August and September 2016.
We used the results from the evaluation to inform programme improvement, by developing and modifying community mobilization strategies.
We employed a multipronged approach to improve community awareness on acute malnutrition and on community-based services for such condition. This approach involved workshops, focus discussion groups in the community and sensitization events at health posts that had issues with community engagement.
Community health workers increased their efforts in active case finding by visiting households with children who had missed the community health post sessions.
We measured the performance using three Sphere minimum standard performance indicators: proportion of children recovering (> 75%); defaulting (< 15%); and dying (<10%).
Results
The community mobilization efforts increased the screening rate from 17% (564/3278) in October 2015 to 66% (6793/10 251) in March 2018.
In 2017, the programme met the three performance indicators: 79% (256/326) of children recovered; 10% (34/326) defaulted; and less than 1% (2/326) died.
Conclusion
In Indonesia, community mobilization is central for addressing severe acute malnutrition in children younger than five years.
This strategy includes securing political leadership and effective messaging alongside locally tailored strategies and continuous ground-level support.
Title
Evaluation of immune protection against Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice induced by a multi-antigenic DNA vaccine containing TgGRA24, TgGRA25 and TgMIC6.
Abstract
Toxoplasma gondii infection is prevalent in humans and animals worldwide.
In this study, recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmids (pVAX-GRA24, pVAX-GRA25 and pVAX-MIC6) were constructed, and then injected into Kunming mice intramuscularly, as cocktailed plasmids or as single-gene plasmids.
We evaluated immune protective responses by detecting the titer of antibodies and cytokine production of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23, the percentages of the subclasses of T lymphocytes, as well as the records of the survival time and cyst decrement in the brain of the mouse model after challenge with the T. gondii RH and Pru strains, respectively.
Compared with the control groups, antibody and cytokine production were significantly increased, while the survival times of mice in all immunized groups were also prolonged, and the number of T. gondii cysts in their brains were decreased significantly (29.03% for pVAX-GRA24; 40.88% for pVAX-GRA25; 37.70% for pVAX-MIC6; 48.06% for pVAX-GRA24 + pVAX-GRA25; and 55.37% for pVAX-GRA24 + pVAX-GRA25 + pVAX-MIC6).
The mouse group immunized with the three-gene cocktail (TgGRA24 + TgGRA25 + TgMIC6) had better performance in each detection index than the mouse groups immunized with the two-gene cocktail of TgGRA24 + TgGRA25, which was better than that in the group immunized with the single gene vaccine of TgGRA24, TgMIC6 or TgGRA25.
In conclusion, TgGRA24 or TgGRA25 may be good vaccine candidates against T. gondii infection, but the three-gene cocktail of TgGRA24, TgMIC6 and TgGRA25 may induce the strongest protective immunity.
Further studies of multi-antigenic DNA vaccines or cocktailed vaccines against T. gondii infection are necessary.
OBJECTIVE
We conducted an environmental scan of quality improvement and patient safety (QIPS) infrastructure and activities in academic emergency medicine (EM) programs and departments across Canada.
METHODS
We developed 2 electronic surveys through expert panel consensus to assess important themes identified by the CAEP QIPS Committee.
"Survey 1"" was sent by email to all 17 Canadian medical school affiliated EM department Chairs and Academic Hospitals department Chiefs; ""Survey 2"" to 12 identified QIPS leads in these hospitals. "
This was followed by 2 monthly email reminders to participate in the survey.
RESULTS
22/70 (31.4%) Department Chairs/Chiefs completed Survey 1.
Most (81.8%) reported formal positions dedicated to QIPS activities within their groups, with a mixed funding model.
Less than half of these positions have dedicated logistical support.
11/12 (91.7%) local QIPS leads completed Survey 2.
Two-thirds (63.6%) reported explicit QIPS topics within residency curricula, but only 9.1% described QIPS training for staff physicians.
Many described successful academic scholarship output, with the total number of peer-reviewed QIPS-related publications per centre ranging from 1-10 over the past 5 years.
Few respondents reported access to academic supports: methodologists (27.3%), administrative personnel (27.3%), and statisticians (9.1%).
CONCLUSION
This environmental scan provides a snapshot of QIPS activities in EM across academic centres in Canada.
We found significant local educational and academic efforts, although there is a discrepancy between the level of formal support/infrastructure and such activities.
There remains opportunity to further advance QIPS efforts on a national level, as well as advocating and supporting local QIPS activities.
Abstract
Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) have been described as multipotent dermal precursors.
Here, we provide a review of the breadth and depth of scientific literature and studies regarding SKPs, accounting for a large number of scientific publications.
Interestingly, these progenitors can be isolated from embryonic and adult skin, as well as from a population of dermal cells cultured in vitro in monolayer.
Gathering information from different authors, this review explores different aspects of the SKP theme, such as the potential distinct origins of SKPs in rodents and in humans, and also their ability to differentiate in vitro and in vivo into multiple lineages of different progeny.
This remarkable capacity makes SKPs an interesting endogenous source of precursors to explore in the framework of experimental and therapeutic applications in different domains.
SKPs are not only involved in the skin's dermal maintenance and support as well as wound healing, but also in hair follicle morphogenesis.
This review points out the interests of future researches on SKPs for innovative perspectives that may be helpful in many different types of scientific and medical domains.
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the nutritional, clinical and immunological status of children at HIV diagnosis in the continental region of Equatorial Guinea.
METHODS
Children <18 years diagnosed with HIV between 2009 and 2017 were included.
Clinical, immunological and nutritional data were collected.
Weight-for-height, weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores were calculated using WHO Child Growth Standards.
The population was assessed in two equal periods (2009-2013 and 2014-2017) from the time of diagnosis.
RESULTS
A total of 213 children were diagnosed with HIV (49.3% males), median age 3.8 years (IQR: 1.5-8.2).
A total of 121 cases (56.8%) were at WHO clinical stage III, and 53 (24.9%) were at WHO clinical stage IV.
CDC immunological stage II was diagnosed in 51/130 (39.2%) and CDC stage III in 44/130 (33.8%).
About 56.2% of children were underweight (weight-for-age <-2 SD); 20.1% moderately and 36.1% severely so.
About 27.6% of children were wasted (weight-for-height <-2 SD); 11.9% moderately and 15.7% severely so.
About 56.3% of children were stunted (height-for-age <-2 SD); 20.7% moderately and 35.6% severely so.
The prevalence of wasting was higher in children ≤5 years than in children >5 years (36.4% vs. 19.1%, P = 0.026).
In the second period, the prevalence of moderate-severe immunodeficiency decreased (87.2% to 67.0%, P = 0.018), without significant differences in the other nutritional or clinical data.
Severe underweight was a risk factor for moderate-severe immunodeficiency (aOR: 4 [95% CI: 1.4-11.4], P = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS
We highlight a high proportion of malnutrition at the time of HIV diagnosis in Guinea´s paediatric population.
Early diagnosis of HIV infection is a priority, achievable by training Guinea´s physicians to suspect HIV early, introducing HIV molecular diagnostic techniques and ensuring intensive nutritional treatment.
Objective
To present findings from implementation and scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) self-testing programmes for female sex workers in Malawi and Zimbabwe, 2013-2018.
Methods
In Zimbabwe, we carried out formative research to assess the acceptability and accuracy of HIV self-testing.
During implementation we evaluated sex workers' preferences for, and feasibility of, distribution of test kits before the programme was scaled-up.
In Malawi, we conducted a rapid ethnographic assessment to explore the context and needs of female sex workers and resources available, leading to a workshop to define the distribution approach for test kits.
Once distribution was implemented, we conducted a process evaluation and established a system for monitoring social harm.
Findings
In Zimbabwe, female sex workers were able to accurately self-test.
The preference study helped to refine systems for national scale-up through existing services for female sex workers.
The qualitative data helped to identify additional distribution strategies and mediate potential social harm to women.
In Malawi, peer distribution of test kits was the preferred strategy.
We identified some incidents of social harm among peer distributors and female sex workers, as well as supply-side barriers to implementation which hindered uptake of testing.
Conclusion
Involving female sex workers in planning and ongoing implementation of HIV self-testing is essential, along with strategies to mitigate potential harm.
Optimal strategies for distribution and post-test support are context-specific and need to consider existing support for female sex workers and levels of trust and cohesion within their communities.
Background
Antibiotic IV-to-oral (IV-PO) conversion is a key initiative of antimicrobial stewardship programs.
Guidelines and education are commonly described interventions to promote IV-PO conversion; however, technological interventions may be more effective in changing practice.
Objective
To determine the impact of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool on the adoption and sustainability of an antibiotic IV-PO conversion program at a community academic hospital.
Methods
A quasi-experimental study consisting of 3 phases was conducted.
During phase 1, the pre-intervention antibiotic IV-PO conversion rate was determined.
During phase 2, the IV-PO conversion policy was updated, education was provided to pharmacists and physicians, and a post-intervention evaluation was conducted.
During phase 3, a CDS tool was developed to generate real-time electronic alerts prompting pharmacists to assess antibiotic therapy, and post-intervention audits were performed 1 month, 3 months, and 15 months after implementation of the tool.
Pantoprazole IV-PO conversion was assessed during each phase as a non-equivalent dependent variable.
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients eligible for IV-PO conversion who were switched to oral therapy.
Results
Of 332 patients receiving targeted IV antibiotic therapy during the overall study period, 122 (37%) met the criteria for IV-PO conversion.
The phase 2 IV-PO conversion rate of 35% (9/26) was comparable to the pre-intervention rate of 29% (10/35) (p = 0.61). Implementation of the CDS tool significantly increased the conversion rate to 78% (14/18), an increase that was sustained at 3 months (71% [17/24]) and 15 months (74% [14/19]) after implementation (p < 0.05 for all comparisons with phases 1 and 2).
Pantoprazole conversion rates were similar across all phases.
Conclusions
Implementation of the CDS tool was effective in improving and sustaining antibiotic IV-PO conversion rates and enhancing policy compliance beyond the effects of policy revision and education.
Refinement of both the policy and the tool is warranted to maximize adoption of the IV-PO conversion program.
Abstract
The growth of aquaculture over the past 50 years has been accompanied by the emergence of aquatic animal diseases, many of which have spread to become pandemic in countries or continents.
An analysis of 400 emerging disease events in aquatic animals that were logged by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science between 2002 and 2017 revealed that more than half were caused by viruses.
However, in molluscs, most events were parasitic.
Categorising these events indicated that the key processes underpinning emergence were the movement of live animals and host switching.
Profiles of key pathogens further illustrate the importance of wild aquatic animals as the source of new infections in farmed animals.
It is also clear that the spread of new diseases through the largescale movement of aquatic animals for farming, for food and for the ornamental trade has allowed many to achieve pandemic status.
Many viral pathogens of fish (e.g. infectious salmon anaemia, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia) and shrimp (e.g. white spot syndrome virus) affect a large proportion of the global production of key susceptible species.
Wild aquatic animal populations have also been severely affected by pandemic diseases, best exemplified by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a fungal infection of amphibians, whose emergence and spread were driven by the movement of animals for the ornamental trade.
Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is now widespread in the tropics and subtropics and has caused local extinctions of susceptible amphibian hosts.
Given the rising demand for seafood, aquacultural production will continue to grow and diseases will continue to emerge.
Some will inevitably achieve pandemic status, having significant impacts on production and trade, unless there are considerable changes in global monitoring and the response to aquatic animal diseases.
Abstract
This study was designed to evaluate the antioxidative status of serum by measuring its total antioxidant capacity, as well as the antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase), in dogs with various stages of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) compared to healthy controls.
In total, 71 client-owned dogs in different stages of DMVD, which included healthy controls, took part in the study.
Following an anamnesis, clinical examination, standard transthoracic echocardiograpic examination, chest X-ray, complete blood (cell) count, and serum biochemistry, dogs were divided into 2 study groups.
Blood was drawn from each dog once at the time of presentation and selected antioxidant parameters were measured using commercially available assay kits.
The activity of superoxide dismutase gradually decreased in the more advanced stages of DMVD, while the activity of catalase was significantly higher in the group of dogs with asymptomatic DMVD compared to healthy controls and dogs with symptomatic DMVD.
No significant changes were noted in total antioxidant capacity and the activity of glutathione reductase.
Results suggested that DMVD has a significant impact on the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the serum of the tested dogs.
Knowledge of changes in the activity of antioxidative enzymes may warrant further studies, possibly to evaluate the potential role of compounds with antioxidative properties in the clinical outcome of dogs with DMVD.
Abstract
On the relationship between the sense of self and the structure of dreams examined through questionnaire research for Japanese university students.
In this paper, the author attempts to show some structural changes in the adolescent mind in modern Japan through examination of our quantitative research of the dreams of university students. Two questionnaires, Scale of Anthropophobia Mentality and Scale of Sense of Self, were administered while asking students about the contents of their 'impressive dreams' in childhood as well as their recent dreams.
By paying attention to the relationship between the sense of self of dream-ego and the structure of dreams, the author demonstrates the subjects' difficulty, or inability, to 'have' anxiety and thereby become active enough both on the surface of their consciousness and in the depth of their unconscious to effect change in their situation.
The author concludes with a suggestion regarding the necessity of a cross-cultural study in this field and adds some points of comparison between German and Japanese dreams reported in psychotherapies.
Title
New records of spirurid nematodes (Nematoda, Spirurida, Guyanemidae, Philometridae & Cystidicolidae) from marine fishes off New Caledonia, with redescriptions of two species and erection of Ichthyofilaroides n. gen.
Abstract
Recent examinations of spirurid nematodes (Spirurida) from deep-sea or coral reef marine fishes off New Caledonia, collected in the years 2006-2009, revealed the presence of the following five species: Ichthyofilaroides novaecaledoniensis (Moravec et Justine, 2009) n. gen., n. comb. (transferred from Ichthyofilaria Yamaguti, 1935) (females) (Guyanemidae) from the deep-sea fish Hoplichthys citrinus (Hoplichthyidae, Scorpaeniformes), Philometra sp. (male fourth-stage larva and mature female) (Philometridae) from Epinephelus maculatus (Serranidae, Perciformes), Ascarophis (Dentiascarophis) adioryx Machida, 1981 (female) (Cystidicolidae) from Sargocentron spiniferum (Holocentridae, Beryciformes), Ascarophis (Ascarophis) nasonis Machida, 1981 (males and females) from Naso lituratus and N. unicornis (Acanthuridae, Perciformes), and Ascarophisnema tridentatum Moravec et Justine, 2010 (female) from Gymnocranius grandoculis (Lethrinidae, Perciformes).
Two species, I. novaecaledoniensis and A. nasonis, are redescribed based on light microscopical (LM) and scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examinations, the latter used in these species for the first time.
Morphological data on the specimen of A. tridentatum from the new host species are provided.
Philometra sp. (from E. maculatus) most probably represents a new gonad-infecting species of this genus.
The newly established genus Ichthyofilaroides n. gen. is characterized mainly by the presence of a small buccal capsule and by the number and distribution of cephalic papillae in the female; it is the sixth genus in the Guyanemidae.
BACKGROUND
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes.
Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal, and cerebral side effects.
Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.
OBJECTIVES
Primary objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention, or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.
SEARCH METHODS
We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 17 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 17 October 2018), and CINAHL; 1982 to 17 October 2018).
We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA
Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We extracted outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three or four of life (after 72 hours of treatment), need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications.
We performed meta-analyses and reported treatment estimates as typical mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed between-study heterogeneity by the I-squared test (I²).
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.
MAIN RESULTS
In this updated analysis, we included nine trials (N = 1070 infants) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen (IV or oral) with placebo/no intervention or indomethacin.
Ibuprofen (IV or oral) probably decreases the risk of PDA on day 3 or 4 (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.48; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.21; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 9 trials; N = 1029) (moderate-quality evidence). In the control group, the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day 3 to 4 of age.
In addition, ibuprofen probably decreases the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (typical RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26; typical RD -0.27, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.22; NNTB 4; 95% CI 3 to 5),and the need for surgical ductal ligation (typical RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a possible decrease in the risk of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in infants receiving prophylactic ibuprofen (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 34%; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to- 0.00; I² = 60%; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). High quality evidence showed increased risk for oliguria (typical RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 17, 95% CI 9 to 100; 4 trials; N = 747).
Low quality results from four studies (N = 202) showed that administering oral ibuprofen may decrease the risk of PDA (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74) and may increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 25).
No evidence of a difference was identified for mortality, any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), or chronic lung disease.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
This review shows that prophylactic use of ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, probably decreases the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and for surgical ductal closure.
Adverse effects associated with ibuprofen (IV or oral) included increased risks for oliguria, increase in serum creatinine levels, and increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
There was a reduced risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III - IV) but no evidence of a difference in mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, or time to reach full feeds.
In the control group, the patent ductus arteriosus had closed spontaneously by day 3 or 4 in 58% of neonates.
Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits.
Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prevention of patent ductus arteriosus.
Until long-term follow-up results of the trials included in this review have been published, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended.
A new approach to patent ductus arteriosus management is an early targeted treatment based on echocardiographic criteria within the first 72 hours of life, that have a high sensitivity for diagnosing a patent ductus arteriosus that is unlikely to close spontaneously.
Such trials are currently ongoing in many parts of the world.
"Results of such trials will be included in updates of our ""Ibuprofen for treatment of PDA"" review."
Background
Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have frequent infectious complications requiring nephrotoxic medications, necessitating monitoring of renal function.
Although adult studies have suggested that cystatin C (CysC)-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be preferable due to reduced muscle mass of patients with CF, pediatric patients remain understudied.
Objective
Our objective was to determine which eGFR formula is best for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in pediatric patients with CF.
Methods
A total of 17 patients with CF treated with nephrotoxic antibiotics were recruited from the Children's Hospital at London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.
99Tc DTPA GFR (measured GFR [mGFR]) was measured with 4-point measurements starting at 120 minutes using a 2-compartmental model with Brøchner-Mortensen correction, with simultaneous measurement of creatinine, urea, and CysC.
The eGFR was calculated using 16 known equations based on creatinine, urea, CysC, or combinations of these.
Primary outcome measures were correlation with mGFR, and agreement within 10% for various eGFR equations.
Results
Mean mGFR was 136 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Mean creatinine, CysC, and urea were 38 ± 10 μmol/L, 0.72 ± 0.08 mg/L, and 3.9 ± 1.4 mmol/L, respectively.
The 2014 Grubb CysC eGFR had the best correlation coefficient (r = 0.75, P = .0004); however, only 35% were within 10%. The new Schwartz formula with creatinine and urea had the best agreement within 10%, but a relatively low correlation coefficient (r = 0.63, P = .0065, 64% within 10%).
Conclusions
Our study suggests that none of the eGFR formulae work well in this small cohort of pediatric patients with CF with preserved body composition, possibly due to inflammation causing false elevations of CysC. Based on the small numbers, we cannot conclude which eGFR formula is best.
Abstract
A study about the influence of polyaxial (true-triaxial) stresses on the permeability of a three-dimensional (3D) fractured rock layer is presented.
"The 3D fracture system is constructed by extruding a two-dimensional (2D) outcrop pattern of a limestone bed that exhibits a ladder structure consisting of a ""through-going"" joint set abutted by later-stage short fractures."
Geomechanical behaviour of the 3D fractured rock in response to in-situ stresses is modelled by the finite-discrete element method, which can capture the deformation of matrix blocks, variation of stress fields, reactivation of pre-existing rough fractures and propagation of new cracks.
A series of numerical simulations is designed to load the fractured rock using various polyaxial in-situ stresses and the stress-dependent flow properties are further calculated.
The fractured layer tends to exhibit stronger flow localisation and higher equivalent permeability as the far-field stress ratio is increased and the stress field is rotated such that fractures are preferentially oriented for shearing.
The shear dilation of pre-existing fractures has dominant effects on flow localisation in the system, while the propagation of new fractures has minor impacts.
The role of the overburden stress suggests that the conventional 2D analysis that neglects the effect of the out-of-plane stress (perpendicular to the bedding interface) may provide indicative approximations but not fully capture the polyaxial stress-dependent fracture network behaviour.
The results of this study have important implications for understanding the heterogeneous flow of geological fluids (e.g. groundwater, petroleum) in subsurface and upscaling permeability for large-scale assessments.
Abstract
Blackleg without skeletal muscle involvement as a cause of sudden death in unvaccinated calves.
Nine, 5-month-old unvaccinated black Angus calves died in less than 48 hours of each other.
The calves expressed minimal or no clinical signs prior to death.
On-farm post-mortem examinations were carried out on 3 of the deceased calves, and findings included: necrotizing and fibrinosuppurative myositis of the diaphragm muscle, and fibrinosuppurative pleuritis and epicarditis.
Fluorescent antibody testing for pathogenic clostridia identified Clostridium chauvoei and a diagnosis of blackleg was made.
The remainder of the herd were then vaccinated.
Setting
Three district hospitals (DHs) and seven health centers (HCs) in rural Rwanda.
Objective
To describe follow-up and treatment outcomes in stage 1 and 2 hypertension patients receiving care at HCs closer to home in comparison to patients receiving care at DHs further from home.
Design
A retrospective descriptive cohort study using routinely collected data involving adult patients aged ⩾18 years in care at chronic non-communicable disease clinics and receiving treatment for hypertension at DH and HC between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2014.
Results
Of 162 patients included in the analysis, 36.4% were from HCs.
Patients at DHs travelled significantly further to receive care (10.4 km vs. 2.9 km for HCs, P < 0.01).
Odds of being retained were significantly lower among DH patients when not adjusting for distance (OR 0.11, P = 0.01).
The retention effect was consistent but no longer significant when adjusting for distance (OR 0.18, P = 0.10).
For those retained, there was no significant difference in achieving blood pressure targets between the DHs and HCs.
Conclusion
By removing the distance barrier, decentralizing hypertension management to HCs may improve long-term patient retention and could provide similar hypertension outcomes as DHs.
Setting
Targeted active screening for tuberculosis (Tas4TB) using mobile trucks in the community was implemented in 15 high TB burden districts in Zimbabwe.
At-risk populations were screened for TB based on symptoms and chest radiography (CXR) results.
Those with any positive symptom and/or an abnormal CXR had sputum collected for investigation and diagnosis and were linked to care and treatment if found to have TB.
Objective
To determine 1) the proportion and characteristics of those screened and diagnosed with TB; 2) the relationship between TB symptoms, CXR and diagnostic yields; and 3) the relationship between initiation of anti-TB treatment and treatment outcomes.
Design
Cohort study using routinely collected data.
Results
A total of 39 065 persons were screened, of whom 663 (1.7%) were diagnosed with TB; 126/663 (19.0%) were bacteriologically confirmed.
The highest TB diagnostic yields were in symptomatic persons with CXRs suggestive of TB (19.4%), asymptomatic persons with CXRs suggestive of TB (8.4%) and persons at high-risk of TB (3.2%).
For all diagnosed TB patients, pre-treatment loss to follow-up was 18.9% and treatment success was 59.9%.
Conclusion
Tas4TB resulted in high diagnostic yields; however, linkage of diagnosis to care was poor.
Reasons for loss to follow-up need to be better understood and rectified.
Title
Evidence from the Lebanon Global School-based Student Health Survey on midwakh tobacco smoking in school students: a harbinger of the next global tobacco pandemic?
Background
Cigarette smoking is the most common form of tobacco consumption but other methods have grown in popularity.
In the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries, smoking dokha, a form of tobacco mixed with herbs and spices in a midwakh pipe, is common.
Aims
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of midwakh use in school students in Lebanon and factors associated with its use.
Methods
Data on tobacco use from the Lebanon Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS), 2017 were analysed, including current midwakh use (defined as midwakh use at least once in the 30 days before the survey).
The survey includes school students in grades 7-12 (12-18 years).
Current midwakh use was analysed according to sociodemographic and tobacco-related variables using bivariate and logistic regression analyses.
Results
Of the 5590 students included in the analysis, 4.6% were current midwakh users.
Current midwakh use was significantly more prevalent in students 13 years and older and in male students (P < 0.01).
Current use was also statistically significantly more prevalent in students in public than private schools.
Current cigarette smoking (OR = 15.22; 95% CI: 11.08-20.90), ever use of a waterpipe (OR = 9.61; 95% CI: 6.66-13.86) and parental smoking (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.05-2.31) were also significantly associated with current midwakh use.
Conclusion
Although midwakh use is low in Lebanon, the patterns of association of midwakh use are similar to those of cigarette and waterpipe smoking in young people.
Further research is needed to understand the context of midwakh use and prevent it from spreading.
Background
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is an extremely rare, heterogeneous disease of uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway that is difficult to diagnose.
We have evaluated the Canadian patients enrolled in the Global aHUS Registry to provide a Canadian perspective regarding the diagnosis and management of aHUS and the specific challenges faced.
Objective
To evaluate Canadian patients enrolled in the Global aHUS Registry to provide a Canadian perspective regarding the diagnosis and management of aHUS and the specific challenges faced.
Methods
The Global aHUS Registry is an observational, noninterventional, multicenter study that has prospectively and retrospectively collected data from patients of all ages with an investigator-made clinical diagnosis of aHUS, irrespective of treatment.
Patients of all ages with a clinical diagnosis of aHUS were eligible and invited for enrollment, and those with evidence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection, or with ADAMTS13 activity ≤10%, or a subsequent diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were excluded.
Data were collected at enrollment and every 6 months thereafter and were analyzed descriptively for categorical and continuous variables.
End-stage renal disease (ESRD)-free survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and ESRD-associated risk factors of interest were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Patients were censored at start of eculizumab for any outcome measures.
Results
A total of 37 Canadian patients were enrolled (15 pediatric and 22 adult patients) between February 2014 and May 2017; the median age at initial aHUS presentation was 25.9 (interquartile range = 6.7-51.7) years; 62.2% were female and 94.6% had no family history of aHUS.
Over three-quarters of patients (78.4%) had no conclusive genetic or anti-complement factor H (CFH) antibody information available, and most patients (94%) had no reported precipitating factors prior to aHUS diagnosis.
Nine patients (8 adults and 1 child) experienced ESRD prior to the study.
After initial presentation, there appears to be a trend that children are less likely to experience ESRD than adults, with 5-year ESRD-free survival of 93 and 56% (P = .05) in children and adults, respectively.
Enrolling physicians reported renal manifestations in all patients at initial presentation, and 68.4% of patients during the chronic phase (study entry ≥6 months after initial presentation).
Likewise, extrarenal manifestations also occurred in more patients during the initial presenting phase than the chronic phase, particularly for gastrointestinal (61.1% vs 15.8%) and central nervous system sites (38.9% vs 5.3%).
Fewer children than adults experienced gastrointestinal manifestations (50.0% vs 70.0%), but more children than adults experienced pulmonary manifestations (37.5% vs 10.0%).
Conclusions
This evaluation provides insight into the diagnosis and management of aHUS in Canadian patients and the challenges faced.
More genetic or anti-CFH antibody testing is needed to improve the diagnosis of aHUS, and the management of children and adults needs to consider several factors such as the risk of progression to ESRD is based on age (more likely in adults), and that the location of extrarenal manifestations differs in children and adults.
INTRODUCTION
The objective of our study was to present model-based estimates and projections on current and future health and economic impacts of cerebral palsy in Canada over a 20-year time horizon (2011-2031).
METHODS
We used Statistics Canada's Population Health Model (POHEM)-Neurological to simulate individuals' disease states, risk factors and health determinants and to describe and project health outcomes, including disease incidence, prevalence, life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, health-related quality of life and health care costs over the life cycle of Canadians.
Cerebral palsy cases were identified from British Columbia's health administrative data sources.
A population-based cohort was then used to generate the incidence and mortality rates, enabling the projection of future incidence and mortality rates.
A utility-based measure (Health Utilities Index Mark 3) was also included in the model to reflect various states of functional health to allow projections of health-related quality of life.
Finally, we estimated caregiving parameters and health care costs from Canadian national surveys and health administrative data and included them as model parameters to assess the health and economic impact of cerebral palsy.
RESULTS
Although the overall crude incidence rate of cerebral palsy is projected to remain stable, newly diagnosed cases of cerebral palsy will rise from approximately 1800 in 2011 to nearly 2200 in 2031.
In addition, the number of people with the condition is expected to increase from more than 75 000 in 2011 to more than 94 000 in 2031.
Direct health care costs in constant 2010 Canadian dollars were about $11 700 for children with cerebral palsy aged 1-4 years versus about $600 for those without the condition.
In addition, people with cerebral palsy tend to have longer periods in poorer health-related quality of life.
CONCLUSION
Individuals with cerebral palsy will continue to face challenges related to an ongoing need for specialized medical care and a rising need for supportive services.
Our study offers important insights into future costs and impacts associated with cerebral palsy and provides valuable information that could be used to develop targeted health programs and strategies for Canadians living with this condition.
Background
There is limited literature on the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in emergency general surgery (EGS) patients.
We undertook this study to identify the rate of symptomatic VTE for patients undergoing EGS operations.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study evaluating EGS patients who underwent operative intervention between March and December 2014.
Data collected included patient demographics, type of procedure, risk of VTE, VTE prophylaxis, development of symptomatic VTE, and mortality.
Results
We included 767 patients in our analysis.
The mean age was 53 ± 19.7 years, and 52.2% of patients were female.
Eighteen patients (2.3%) experienced VTE in hospital and 12 (1.6%) experienced VTE after discharge.
Only 66% of patients received appropriate VTE prophylaxis.
High-risk patients had a higher VTE rate (7.4% v. 2.3%, p < 0.001) and higher mortality (17.6% v. 4.0%, p < 0.001) than lowto moderate-risk patients.
Conclusion
The risk of VTE in patients requiring EGS is significant and persists after hospital discharge.
Further studies on quality improvement with VTE prophylaxis are warranted.
Background
Gastroesophageal varices are the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with cirrhosis.
Vitamin K1 is commonly administered to patients presenting with UGIB and elevated international normalized ratio, despite limited evidence to support this practice.
Objectives
The primary objective was to describe the incidence of rebleeding within 30 days after vitamin K1 administration in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.
The secondary objective was to describe prescribing patterns for vitamin K1.
Methods
This retrospective, descriptive multicentre study involved patients with cirrhosis and UGIB who were admitted to any of the 4 adult acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016.
Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who received vitamin K1 and those who did not.
Results
A total of 370 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 243 received vitamin K1 and 127 did not.
Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups.
Greater proportions of patients in the vitamin K1 group received transfusions of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, or prothrombin concentrate during their admissions.
There was no significant difference in the duration of octreotide and pantoprazole infusions.
Among patients in the vitamin K1 group, there were more admissions to the intensive care unit and longer lengths of stay.
More patients in the no vitamin K1 group had esophageal varices evident on endoscopy that required endoscopic treatment.
Forty of the patients (16.5%) in the vitamin K1 group and 7 (5.5%) in the no vitamin K1 group had rebleeding within 30 days of the initial bleed.
The median total vitamin K1 dose administered was 25 mg.
Conclusions
The study results suggest that vitamin K1 does not reduce the incidence of rebleeding within 30 days of the initial bleed in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.
Background
Endoscopic transaxillary augmentation mammaplasty breast augmentation offers several advantages over other augmentation methods.
Nonetheless, this procedure is fraught with some problems, including greater surgical trauma due to the longer separation area.
We hypothesized that cold separation of the interpectoral space could reduce surgical injury in comparison to the electrosurgical method.
This study aimed to compare the outcomes of endoscopic-assisted transaxillary augmentation mammaplasty using cold separation versus electrosurgical separation of the interpectoral space.
Methods
In this prospective clinical trial, cold and electrosurgical separation of the interpectoral space were achieved using a separation shovel and monopolar electrotome, respectively.
A total of 20 patients who visited our department in Beijing, China, for primary breast augmentation surgeries from October 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018, were included.
The primary outcome was total postoperative drainage volume.
The secondary outcomes were operative time, daily drainage volume, daily pain as assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), and reoperation rate.
Chi-square test was used to compare 2 classified indexes.
Results
The total drainage volume was significantly lower in the cold separation group than in the electrosurgical separation group (170.45 ± 75.40 mL vs 281.05 ± 148.43 mL; P = .005).
The VAS score on the first postoperative day was significantly lower in the cold separation group than in the electrosurgical separation group (6.45 ± 1.93 vs 7.55 ± 1.43; P = .048).
Two (20%) reoperations owing to postoperative pain or implant stiffness were performed in the electrosurgical separation group.
Conclusions
Cold separation is more conducive to reducing drainage, relieving postoperative pain, and causing less damage than the electrosurgical method in endoscopic-assisted transaxillary dual-plane augmentation mammaplasty.
Objective
To assess the effect of a permanent gun-carrying restriction on gun-related mortality in Colombia between 2008 and 2014, and determine differences in the effect of the restriction by place of death and sex.
Methods
In 2012, Bogotá and Medellín introduced a permanent gun-carrying restriction.
We compared gun-related mortality rates in these cities (intervention cities) with the rates in all other Colombian cities with more than 500 000 inhabitants (control cities).
We used data from the Colombian National Department of Statistics to calculate monthly gun-related mortality rates between 2008 and 2014 for intervention and control cities.
We used a differences-in-differences method with fixed effects to assess differences in gun-related mortality in intervention and control cities before and after the introduction of the gun-carrying restriction.
We stratified effects by place of death (public area or residence) and sex.
We made robustness checks to test the assumptions of the models.
Findings
Gun-related deaths in the control and intervention cities decreased between 2008 and 2014; however, the decrease was greater in the intervention cities (from 20.29 to 14.93 per 100 000 population; 26.4%) than in the control cities (from 37.88 to 34.56 per 100 000 population; 8.8%).
The restriction led to a 22.3% reduction in the monthly gun-related mortality rate in Bogotá and Medellín.
The reduction was greater in public areas and for males.
Robustness checks supported the assumptions of the models.
Conclusion
The permanent restriction on carrying guns reduced gun-related deaths.
This policy could be used to reduce gun-related injuries in urban centres of other countries with large numbers of gun-related deaths.
Title
Prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon: a national survey.
Background
Diabetes mellitus in all its forms has been rapidly increasing worldwide, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Aims
This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM).
Methods
A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household.
A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population.
Results
The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%. The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus.
Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians.
Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients.
Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission.
Diagnosed complications were reported in 22% of cases, with retinopathy being the most common.
Conclusions
Prevalence of T1DM in this population was lower than international estimates.
Diabetes mellitus management appears to be deficient, based on delays in standard control testing, hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetes mellitus-related complications.
Coordination of diabetic care management should be devolved to primary healthcare physicians, who can keep track of the need for referral to various types of diabetes mellitus care.
Title
Hand hygiene initiative: comparative study of pre- and postintervention outcomes.
Background
Adequate hand hygiene is considered the most effective measure to reduce transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
Aims
To determine the effectiveness of infection control intervention to improve compliance with hand hygiene in the Emergency Department, Al-Leith General Hospital, Saudi Arabia, and evaluate bacterial load on hands as a possible indicator of improvement.
Methods
The study consisted of 3 phases: Phase I, measurement of basal hand hygiene compliance level; Phase II, multimodal hand hygiene educational programme was initiated; and Phase III, hand hygiene compliance level was measured again.
"Data were collected by direct observation of healthcare workers in the emergency department between October 2016 and March 2017, using the standardized World Health Organization method for direct observation, ""Five Moments for Hand Hygiene"". The intervention comprised health education sessions using direct personal contact."
Hands of healthcare workers were sampled during Phases I and III by sterile bag method, and bacterial load was determined.
Results
A total of 1374 opportunities for hand hygiene were observed during the triphase study.
Implementation of the interventional hand hygiene educational programme significantly improved compliance with hand hygiene guidelines from 30.7% to 45.5% (P < 0.01).
Log10 bacterial load per hand dropped from 4.97 (standard deviation = 0.32) to 4.57 (0.47) (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
Hand hygiene educational programmes were effective in improving compliance in the emergency department, and bacterial load on hands of healthcare workers could be used as an indicator of improvement in hand hygiene compliance.
Background
Although appropriate noninvasive cardiac tests (NICTs) after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) provide useful prognostic information, inappropriate use leads to inefficient expenditure of existing healthcare resources.
By using the Alberta Contemporary Acute Coronary Syndrome Patient Invasive Treatment Strategies (COAPT) Registry, we evaluated the use and costs of NICTs among patients discharged within 1 year after ACS.
Methods
All patients discharged from the hospital with a primary diagnosis of ACS in Alberta between 2004/2005 and 2015/2016 were included.
Frequency of NICTs (stress tests [± imaging] and nonstress imaging tests) was determined from linked provincial databases.
Costs were obtained from the Alberta Health Care Insurance Plan Medical Procedure List.
Results
Of 55,516 patients with ACS, 30,760 had at least 1 NICT (55.4%), with 13,505 (24.3%) having > 1 NICT performed within 1 year.
Temporal trends of NICT increased over time (stress tests: P trend < 0.001; nonstress imaging tests: P trend < 0.001).
NICT most commonly occurred within the first 4 months after hospital discharge (stress tests at 2 months; nonstress imaging tests at 3-4 months).
In 2015/2016, the total estimated costs of NICT were $1.35M, a 22.4% increase from 2004/2005 (1.10M) (P < 0.001), whereas a decrease in incidence of ACS over the same time period was noted (P = 0.008).
Conclusions
Rates of NICT 1 year after ACS are high and increasing over time.
Estimated costs of NICT appear to be escalating out of proportion to the ACS growth.
Further investigation is warranted because it is speculative whether the increase in NICT and costs results in clinical benefit after ACS.
Background
Relocation, recruitment, or retirement of critical team members may lead to changes in the expertise pool that could threaten patient outcomes in a pediatric heart program.
We developed a quality initiative aimed at risk management that uses risk-stratified case complexity and outcomes to guide a program during critical fluxes in the expert staff.
The Ramp Down/Up protocol is a systematic, voluntary reduction in the complexity of cases performed, followed by a transparent and intentional escalation of case complexity.
Methods
Institutional Ethics Review Board approval for this quality initiative was obtained.
Patient/caregiver consent for quality data collection is obtained at the time of hospital admission.
Every surgical patient having their index cardiac surgical procedure at the Izaak Walton Killam (IWK) from January 1, 2003, to December 2015 is included.
The Ramp Down/Up protocol evolved to have to 4 critical elements: (1) a trigger and a reduction in case complexity; (2) an external/objective expert observer; (3) an escalation in case complexity; and (4) data (qualitative and quantitative) collection and analysis.
Results
The Ramp Down/Up protocol was used 3 times over a 12-year period to address critical expert human resource challenges. The protocol was used for variable duration (3.5-9 months).
Patient operative mortality was benchmarked to the Congenital Cardiac Surgery database, and outcomes were stable during and after protocol employment.
Conclusions
A quality initiative aimed at risk management has allowed 1 pediatric heart team to ensure that patient outcomes were maintained during critical human resource changes.
Abstract
In the last few decades, types of diseases affecting people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have shifted as the population ages, with cardiovascular disease becoming a leading cause of death in this population.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia both in the general population and in PLHIV, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to 3% among PLHIV.
Prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (SSE) with antithrombotic therapy is a cornerstone of AF treatment and substantially decreases AF-related morbidity and mortality.
Although updated guidelines extensively discuss this issue, they do not address the peculiarities of PLHIV.
The role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as an independent factor for SSE in individuals with AF and whether the presence of HIV should alter the threshold for SSE thromboprophylaxis are unknown.
Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence describes the increasing burden of comorbidities such as hypertension and stroke in PLHIV, which predispose them to AF and SSE.
In the absence of HIV-specific AF guidelines, PLHIV with AF should be comprehensively assessed for their risk of SSE and bleeding using commonly available scores despite them having been primarily validated in the non-HIV population.
Both vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants can be used in PLHIV.
Addressing HIV-related comorbidities and potential drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals is crucial to prevent SSE and reduce adverse reactions of oral anticoagulants.
This review summarizes the current guidelines for SSE prevention in patients with AF and describes key considerations for their implementation among PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy.
