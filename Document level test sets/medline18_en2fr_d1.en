Abstract
In their early stages, some dermatoses of the scalp such as psoriasis seborrheic dermatitis, tinea capitis and discoid lupus erythematosus are often hardly noticeable to others.
However, the eruptions are occasionally severe and extensive.
Reaching an adequate diagnosis is of utmost impor¬tance for an adequate healthcare.


Abstract
Increasing use of antibiotics and rising levels of bacterial resistance to antibiotics are a challenge to global health and development.
Successful initiatives for containing the problem need to be communicated and disseminated.
In Sweden, a rapid spread of resistant pneumococci in the southern part of the country triggered the formation of the Swedish strategic programme against antibiotic resistance, also known as Strama, in 1995.
The creation of the programme was an important starting point for long-term coordinated efforts to tackle antibiotic resistance in the country.
This paper describes the main strategies of the programme: committed work at the local and national levels; monitoring of antibiotic use for informed decision-making; a national target for antibiotic prescriptions; surveillance of antibiotic resistance for local, national and global action; tracking resistance trends; infection control to limit spread of resistance; and communication to raise awareness for action and behavioural change.
A key element for achieving long-term changes has been the bottom-up approach, including working closely with prescribers at the local level.
The work described here and the lessons learnt could inform countries implementing their own national action plans against antibiotic resistance.


Abstract
Physical activity is necessary for life and is one of the greatest opportunities to improve the health of populations, although it is sometimes mixed up with sports which can cause injuries or acute cardiac events.
Nevertheless, some sedentaries can present with metabolic adverse responses after initiation of a well-planned, health-enhancing physical activity program.
This sort of exercise intolerance has some genetic roots and does not necessarily imply that all physical activity should be stopped, but rather must be considered as a side effect of therapy that needs optimizing.
Individualization of exercise prescription will always consider follow-up and has to be dynamic according to observations made with the patient.


Abstract
Infertility treatment doesn't stop in the technical and specific processing.
The psychological distress may be very important and a frequent cause of drop-out during the medical procedure.
Therefore the couple should be taken into account globally. Different level of counselling sessions should be offered to give the couple complete information about the procedure.
The psychological counselling should be tailored to their need in term of coping strategies in the management of the stress or more specific psychotherapeutical approach.
Indeed consultation-liaison psychiatric interventions should be offered when the couple is known for psychiatric comorbidities or is presenting anxio-depressive symptoms in reaction to medical procedure.


Abstract
GOLD 2017 Report highlights the importance of patient symptoms and exacerbation risks in influencing some therapeutic decisions for individualized patient care.
Assessment of the severity of airway obstruction is now separated from the " ABCD " groups but remains a key step for the diagnosis, prognostication and nonpharmacological therapies of COPD patients.
Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, alone or in combination, have a central role in the treatment of COPD patients.
Their prolonged action allows a significant improvement not only of FEV1, but also of dyspnoea and health status.
A clinically important effect was more frequently reached with LABA+LAMA combination than with either medication alone.
LAMAs have a greater effect on exacerbation reduction compared to LABAs and LABA+LAMA combination reduces exacerbations compared to monotherapy or LABA+ICS combination.
As regular treatment with ICS increases the risk of pneumonia, LABA+ICS combination is not a primary choice excepted in selected cortico-sensitive patients.
When appropriate, withdrawal of ICS is achievable without significant harm using LABA+LAMA combination.
Studies determining the precise place of LABA+LAMA+ICS combination in the treatment strategy are underway.


Abstract
Embolic stroke is the most dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AF).
Oral anticoagulation represents the treatment of choice for thromboembolic (TE) prophylaxis in patients with a CHADS2VASc score ≥ 1 but is associated with a significant increase in haemorrhagic events.
Almost 90 % of thrombi originate in the left atrial appendage.
Registries have shown that percutaneous occlusion of this appendage reduces embolic risk and may be considered for TE prophylaxis in patients with a high TE (CHADS2VASc score ≥ 2) and haemorrhagic (HAS-BLED score ≥ 3) risk.
However, available randomized trials of this technique did not include patients with contraindication to oral anticoagulants.


Abstract
There is no personalized anticancer treatment without individualized dosing.
Clearly, BSA-based chemotherapy dosing does not improve the substantial pharmacokinetic variability of individual drugs.
Similarly, the new oral kinase inhibitors and endocrine compounds exhibit a marked pharmacokinetic variability due to variable absorption, hepatic metabolism and potential drug-drug and food-drug interactions.
Therapeutic drug monitoring and genotyping may allow more individualized dosing of anticancer compounds in the future.
However, the large number of anticancer drugs that are newly approved or undergoing preclinical development are a substantial challenge for the development of substance-specific dosing algorithms.
It will be necessary to implement individual dosing strategies in the early clinical development of new anticancer drugs to inform clinicians at the time of first approval.


Abstract
Management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is getting complex with the apparition of new treatments, but also new technologies.
Among these, continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) lead to a better glycemic control and less hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic patients.
Studies are scarce in type 2 diabetes but also seem to show a benefit, particularly in patients using insulin.
Nevertheless, type 2 diabetic patients taking advantage of CGMS must be better defined.
In any case, a multidisciplinary approach to the use of CGMS and interpretation of data is warranted.


Abstract
Although immunization has decreased the incidence of bacterial pneumonia in vaccinated children, pneumonia remains common in healthy children.
Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia frequently overlap those present with viral infections or reactive airway disease.
Optimally, the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia should be supported by a chest radiograph before starting antimicrobials.
Factors such as age, vital signs and other measures of illness severity are critical when deciding whether to admit a patient to hospital.
Because Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children, prescribing amoxicillin or ampicillin for seven to 10 days remains the mainstay of empirical therapy for nonsevere pneumonia.
If improvement does not occur, consideration should be given to searching for complications (empyema or lung abscess).
Routine chest radiographs at the end of therapy are not recommended unless clinically indicated.


Abstract
The extensor tendons to the index, long, ring and small fingers are motored by the common extensor digitorum communis muscle body.
Effective function of this muscle can only occur if the gliding amplitude of each of its four extensor tendons is normal.
As a corollary, limitation of the excursion of any of the individual tendons by adhesions at a fracture or tendon repair site, a fixed flexion contracture at the metacarpophalangeal joint, or by rupture, attenuation or laceration of a saggital band or juncturae tendinum, will result in reduction of the excursion of the adjacent extensor tendons.
This pathological state has been termed the extensor quadriga because of its similarities to the analogous pathology affecting the flexor digitorum profundus system.
Improper management of this clinical entity may lead to an abnormal pathomechanical kinematic chain imbalance.
Early identification and treatment is critical to address this entity appropriately.


Abstract
Behavioural addictions are characterized by an inability to resist an urge or drive resulting in actions that are harmful to oneself or others.
Behavioural addictions share characteristics with substance and alcohol abuse, and in areas such as natural history, phenomenology, and adverse consequences.
Behavioural addictions include pathological gambling, kleptomania, pyromania, compulsive buying, compulsive sexual behaviour, Internet addiction, and binge eating disorder.
Few studies have examined the efficacy of pharmacological and psychological treatment for the various behavioural addictions, and therefore, currently, no treatment recommendations can be made.


Abstract
Middle childhood, from six to 12 years of age, is often known as the 'forgotten years' of development because most research is focused on early childhood development or adolescent growth.
However, middle childhood is rich in potential for cognitive, social, emotional and physical advancements.
During this period, the brain is actively undergoing synaptic pruning and, as such, is constantly becoming more refined, a process that is heavily dependent on a child's environment.
This discovery opens the door to optimizing the experiences a child needs to provide themselves with a strong foundation for adulthood.
The present article reviews the neurological changes that occur in middle childhood, their impact on overall development and how to implement this knowledge to augment a child's capabilities.


Abstract
Acute compression of the median nerve in the forearm usually occurs from compartment syndrome.
A case of acute compression neuropathy of the median nerve from a foreign body, where there was no evidence of compartment syndrome, is reported.
The diagnosis was made from the patient's symptoms and radiographs.
Early recognition and decompression of the forearm with removal of the foreign body led to full recovery.

Abstract
Faced with diffuse pain, the doctor must evoke a wide range of pathologies.
It is necessary to think about rare illnesses such as myopathy or vasculitis, but also more common illnesses such as fibromyalgia.
Contrary to popular belief, it is difficult to give a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, on average 2 years after the onset of symptoms.
This can be explained by heterogeneous complaints and the doctor delaying the diagnosis with unnecessary complimentary examinations.Patient education and physical activity are the most important steps of treatment.
Few drugs have proven effective and their use is limited due to significant side effects.
The evolution of fibromyalgia is chronic, with a mixed prognosis.


Abstract
Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. The clinical presentation of sepsis in the elderly is very variable and sepsis is therefore challenging to diagnose in this population.
The new sepsis definitions published in 2016, which are based on objective clinical and biological scores, should lead to earlier recognition and diagnosis.
Treatment should start as soon as possible because the specific pathophysiological changes of aging increase the risk of a sudden deterioration to septic shock.
Physicians should treat elderly patients with sepsis according to internationally recommended guidelines but should take into account specific aspects related to the elderly. These aspects include the presence of specific comorbidities and the need to clarify the overall objectives of care when deciding to admit a patient to the intensive care unit.


Abstract
Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a known complication of the large-volume resuscitation that burn patients receive.
Bowel ischemia has been theorized to occur in ACS but has yet to be described in the literature.
The authors report an occurrence of late bowel obstruction related to ACS-associated bowel ischemia in a burn patient.
A four-year-old previously well girl sustained 70% total body surface area burns with inhalation injury.
The areas injured were the anterior neck, circumferential torso from neck to waist, left arm, left thigh and two-thirds of her right thigh.
Fluid resuscitation was initially administered using the modified Parkland formula.
Her transfer to the regional burn unit from a local hospital was complicated by early septic shock from a line infection, which increased her resuscitation fluid requirements.
Infection ultimately led to multiple instances of ACS.
Intervention with percutaneous drainage led to immediate improvement; however, the episodes of ACS resulted in a late small bowel obstruction secondary to stricture, requiring a laparotomy and bowel resection.


Abstract
During the 80s and 90s, early and total excision of full thickness burns followed by immediate autograft was the most common treatment, with repeated excision and grafting, mostly for failed grafts.
It was hypothesized, therefore, that delayed coverage with an autograft preceded by a temporary xenograft after early and sequential smaller excisions would lead to a better wound bed with fewer failed grafts, a smaller donor site, and possibly also a shorter duration of stay in hospital.
We carried out a case control study with retrospective analysis from our National Burn Centre registry for the period 1997-2011.
Patients who had been managed with early total excision and autograft were compared with those who had had sequential smaller excisions covered with temporary xenografts until the burn was ready for the final autograft.
The sequential excision and xenograft group (n=42) required one-third fewer autografts than patients in the total excision and autograft group (n=45), who needed more than one operation (p


Abstract
The prevalence of nocardia infections is increasing because of both improved detection laboratory techniques and a higher number of immunosuppressed patients.
We report the case of a patient with brain abcesses resulting from nocardia farcinica cerebral dissemination associated with lung infection, endocarditis and ocular lesions for which we suspected a similar origin.
This case gives the opportunity to discuss the main issues of these infections and the current therapeutic guidelines.


Abstract
Various properties of digoxin have been exploited for decades, amongst which are its positive inotropy used in the treatment of heart failure, and its vagotonic effect used to slow ventricular response to atrial fibrillation.
Pharmacologic properties of digoxin are however characterised by a narrow therapeutic interval, and recent observational studies suggest a potential association with increased mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation.
As a result and because of available alternative therapeutic strategies, current guidelines do not recommend digoxin as first line treatment of atrial fibrillation.
Digoxin may be considered in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response when other therapeutic options cannot be pursued.


Abstract
Observational data show a consistent association between elevated low density lipoproteins (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Statins are currently the most effective drugs for lowering LDL-C, but can present side effects which might limit the prescribed dosage and prevent patients from reaching the recommended LDL levels.
Although treated with statins important residual cardiovascular event risk remains in patients in primary and secondary prevention for CVD.
The discovery of protein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 antibodies is a very promising new hypolipidemic treatment and the aim of this review is to explain their mechanism of action and to discuss safety and efficacy results of some phase III studies.


Abstract
We are pleased to bring you the second of two special issues on mood and anxiety disorders focussing on data from the 2014 Survey on Living with Chronic Diseases in Canada-Mood and Anxiety Disorder Component (SLCDC-MA).
In December of 2016, we published the first issue, which included three articles describing various aspects of Canadian adults with a self-reported diagnosed mood and/or anxiety disorder including their sociodemographic characteristics, health status, activity limitations and level of disability and factors associated with well-being.
The three articles in this (second) issue investigate topics related to the management of these disorders.
Collectively, the articles explore key sociodemographic factors known to influence health-related outcomes and discuss strategies aimed at promoting the recovery and well-being of Canadian adults with a self-reported mood and/or anxiety disorder diagnosis.


Abstract
Acute pancreatitis is a frequent disease, with a simple course in 80 % of the cases but a high morbidity and mortality in its severe form.
Biliary origin and alcohol represent 80 % of the etiologies.
Except endoscopic removal of gallstone for biliary origin, treatment remains symptomatic and focuses on fluid resuscitation, effective antalgia and adapted management of nutrition.
This article focuses on the novelties introduced by the revision of the Classification of Atlanta in 2012 and details current guidelines for the management of the disease.
The evolution of conservative treatment has allowed to reduce and postpone need for surgery and requires an interdisciplinary collaboration between surgeons, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists and intensivists.


Abstract
Nucleotide sequences of field strains of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) contribute to our understanding of the distribution and evolution of viral lineages that circulate in different regions of the world.
This paper outlines a practical reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing strategy that can be used to generate RNA sequences encoding the VP1 (1D) region of FMDV.
The protocol contains a panel of PCR and sequencing primers that can be selected to characterise genetically diverse isolates representing all seven FMDV serotypes.
A list of sequences is also described, comprising prototype sequences for all proposed FMDV topotypes, in order to provide a framework for phylogenetic analysis.
The technical details and prototype sequences provided in this paper can be employed by FMD Reference Laboratories and others in an approach to harmonise the molecular epidemiology of FMDV.


Abstract
Overutilization of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is obvious despite available recommendations, with clinical and economical issues.
This overuse is due to abusive stress ulcer prophylaxis and to automatic represcription, particularly during transitions from intensive care unit to other inhospital units and at hospital discharge.
Withdrawal symptoms may contribute to the difficulty of PPI interruption.
It is mandatory to limit initiation of PPI treatment outside of appropriate indications and to regularly reassess the need of this treatment.


Abstract
The general internist cannot be a passive bystander of the anticipated medical revolution induced by precision medicine.
This latter aims to improve the predictive and/or clinical course of an individual by integrating all biological, genetic, environmental, phenotypic and psychosocial knowledge of a person.
In this article, national and international initiatives in the field of precision medicine are discussed as well as the potential financial, ethical and limitations of personalized medicine.
The question is not to know if precision medicine will be part of everyday life but rather to integrate early the general internist in multidisciplinary teams to ensure optimal information and shared-decision process with patients and individuals.


Abstract
The evaluation of the development of young children had to consider the possible detection of neurodevelopmental disorders in particular autism spectrum disorders.
When a child of 18 months has a developmental language delay or a defect in social contact, the hypothesis of autism must be considered through a clinical evaluation.
We will point out some clinical guidelines and some early signs to detect the trouble and to propose early treatment interventions.
This will help to develop specific skills of the child aiming at influencing positively clinical evolution and reducing mental retardation.


Abstract
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a new radiation technique that combines improvements in radiotherapy planning, intensity modulation and image guidance.
The use of SBRT enables radiotherapy to be delivered instead of in six weeks in only a few days and with ablative total dose.
Prospective phase II studies in patients with inoperable early stage non-small cell lung cancer demonstrate that the use of SBRT results in local control rates of 85-95% with acceptable toxicity.
SBRT is also increasingly used for treatment of metastases in the lung, liver, retroperitoneum and in bones.
Because SBRT enables a locally curative dose to be delivered in a time efficient manner this technique also opens up new perspectives for the treatment of patients with oligometastases.


Abstract
This paper reviews institutional changes in pastureland use in China over the last 30 years and discusses their impacts on pastoral communities, drawing evidence from case studies of two agro-pastoralist and two pastoralist communities.
Those who rely directly on pastureland for their livelihood are vulnerable to the joint effects of pastureland degradation and climate change.
The authors argue that a 'top-down' governance structure with no participation from local communities and a 'one size fits all' institutional solution are a poor fit for pastoralism management.
The authors conclude that the current institutional environment in China may be leading to decreasing populations, reduced livestock rearing, impoverishment and increasing inequality within pastoral communities.
Bearing in mind that pastoral systems have characteristics that are specific to their areas and tailored to their local context, the authors recommend paying greater attention to 'bottom-up', locally specified strategies which can be combined with long-term institutional arrangements that have historically provided pastoralists and agro-pastoralists with the resources to adapt to change.


Abstract
Dementia prevalence estimates vary among population-based studies, depending on the definitions of dementia, methodologies and data sources and types of costs they use.
A common approach is needed to avoid confusion and increase public and stakeholder confidence in the estimates.
Since 1994, five major studies have yielded widely differing estimates of dementia prevalence and monetary costs of dementia in Canada.
These studies variously estimated the prevalence of dementia for the year 2011 as low as 340 170 and as high as 747 000.
The main reason for this difference was that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was not consistently included in the projections.
The estimated monetary costs of dementia for the same year also varied, from $910 million to $33 billion.
This discrepancy is largely due to three factors: (1) the lack of agreed-upon methods for estimating financial costs; (2) the unavailability of prevalence estimates for the various stages of dementia (mild, moderate and severe), which directly affect the amount of money spent; and (3) the absence of tools to measure direct, indirect and intangible costs more accurately.
Given the increasing challenges of dementia in Canada and around the globe, reconciling these differences is critical for developing standards to generate reliable information for public consumption and to shape public policy and service development.


Abstract
The goal of this work was the development of suitable (real-time) RT-PCR techniques for fast and sensitive diagnosis of EAV and for molecular-epidemiological characterisation of viral strains, as an alternative to virus isolation.
To this purpose two conventional RT-PCR methods and one real-time RT-PCR were adapted to detect the broadest possible spectrum of viral strains.
Several dilutions with Bucyrus strain showed a 100-fold higher sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR and heminested RT-PCR compared to simple RT-PCR.
Making use of 11 cell culture supernatants of different EAV isolates and 7 semen samples of positive stallions, the suitability of the techniques could be shown.
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the newly analysed samples compared with known sequences indicated that more EAV-lineages exist than presently described.


Abstract
Molecular imaging techniques have a number of advantages for research into the pathophysiology and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders.
Firstly, they provide a noninvasive means of characterizing physiological processes in the living brain, enabling molecular alterations to be linked to clinical changes.
Secondly, the pathophysiological target in a given CNS disorder can be measured in animal models and in experimental human models in the same way, which enables translational research.
Moreover, as molecular imaging facilitates the detection of functional change which precedes gross pathology, it is particularly useful for the early diagnosis and treatment of CNS disorders.
This review considers the application of molecular imaging to CNS disorders focusing on its potential to inform the development and evaluation of treatments. We focus on schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, depression, and dementia as major CNS disorders.
We also review the potential of molecular imaging to guide new drug development for CNS disorders.


Abstract
The purpose of the study was to compare the conductance and mannitol permeability of canine colonic mucosa in response to carprofen or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) with or without tempol pretreatment.
Ten colonic mucosa sections per dog were mounted in Ussing chambers.
Treatments were done in duplicate.
Mucosa was exposed to carprofen (200 μg/mL) or DNP (0.25 mM), both with and without tempol (1 mM) pretreatment.
Conductance was calculated every 15 min for 240 min.
Mannitol flux was calculated over 3 consecutive 60-minute periods.
Histology or electron microscopy was done after exposure.
Conductance over time, mannitol flux, frequency of histologic categories, and electron microscopic changes were analyzed for treatment effects.
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) conductance over time for carprofen or DNP-treated colons was not significantly different from control regardless of tempol pretreatment.
Period 3 mannitol fluxes for carprofen and DNP-treated colon were not significantly different, but were greater than control.
Period 3 mannitol flux for tempol + carprofen was significantly less than tempol + DNP-treated colon.
Sloughing of cells and erosions were seen in the mucosa of carprofen-treated colon.
Mitochondrial damage was seen more often in carprofen-treated than DNP-treated or control colon.
Tempol pretreatment resulted in more ruptured mitochondria in the carprofen-treated colon; however, other mitochondrial changes were not significantly affected by tempol pretreatment in either carprofen or DNP treated colon.
Treatment with carprofen or DNP increased the mannitol flux, but pretreatment with tempol mitigated the carprofen effect.
It is apparent that structural mitochondrial damage occurs in the canine colonic mucosa after carprofen and DNP exposure.

This paper presents a case in which a chemical burn resulted from the use of garlic as a naturopathic medicine for knee pain.


Abstract
Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also referred to as deep, high-throughput or massively parallel sequencing, is a powerful new tool that can be used for the complex diagnosis and intensive monitoring of infectious disease in veterinary medicine.
NGS technologies are also being increasingly used to study the aetiology, genomics, evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease, as well as host-pathogen interactions and other aspects of infection biology.
This review briefly summarises recent progress and achievements in this field by first introducing a range of novel techniques and then presenting examples of NGS applications in veterinary infection biology.
Various work steps and processes for sampling and sample preparation, sequence analysis and comparative genomics, and improving the accuracy of genomic prediction are discussed, as are bioinformatics requirements.
Examples of sequencing-based applications and comparative genomics in veterinary medicine are then provided.
This review is based on novel references selected from the literature and on experiences of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Collaborating Centre for the Biotechnology-based Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases in Veterinary Medicine, Uppsala, Sweden.


Abstract
Falls are a common and serious risk with an aging population.
Chiropractors commonly see firsthand the effects of falls and resulting injuries in their senior patients and they can reduce falls risk through active screening.
Ongoing research has provided proven approaches for making falls less likely.
Screening for falls should be done yearly for all patients 65 years and older or in those with a predisposing medical condition.
Additional specific falls prevention professional education would enable the chiropractor to best assist these patients.
Collaboration and communication with the patient's family physician offers an opportunity for improved interprofessional dialogue to enhance patient care related to falls risk.
Frequently falls prevention strategies are implemented by an interprofessional team.
Chiropractors increasingly contribute within multidisciplinary teams.
Collaboration by the chiropractor requires both simple screening and knowledge of health care system navigation.
Such awareness can permit optimal participation in the care of their patient and the best outcome.


Abstract
The evidence is clear that early childhood interventions and supports have long-term health and social benefits - coordinated action is required to ensure that every Canadian child benefits.
While many advances have been made to improve the chances for Canadian children to have a healthy opportunity for early childhood development, there is much to be done to ensure that they have the best opportunities possible.
To ensure every child is able to reach their full potential, the following wishes are identified for Canadian children: a fairer share of the GDP for Canadian children; the development of a strong early years system; designation of a national lead on behalf of children and youth; a focus on prevention; and development of systems to monitor success and failure.


Abstract
Insufficient operational research (OR) is generated within programmes and health systems in low- and middle-income countries, partly due to limited capacity and skills to undertake and publish OR in peer-reviewed journals.
To address this, a three-module course was piloted by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and Médecins Sans Frontières in 2009-2010, with 12 participants.
Five received mentorship and financial support as OR Fellows.
Eleven of 12 participants submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal within 4 weeks of the end of the course.
Evaluation shows that participants continued OR activities beyond the course.
During the subsequent year, they submitted and/or published 19 papers, made 10 posters and/or presentations, and many participated in training, mentoring and/or paper reviewing.
Some described changes in policy and practice influenced by their research, and changes in their organisation's approach to OR.
They provided recommendations for improving and expanding OR.
We conclude that participants can, with certain enabling conditions, take research questions through to publication, use skills gained to undertake and promote OR thereafter and contribute to improvement in policy and practice.
An internet-based network will provide participants and graduates with a platform for collection of course outcomes and ongoing mentor- and peer-based support, resources and incentives.


Abstract
In 2015 a computer-based system of incident reporting was implemented in our hospital. Since then our department has successfully managed this reporting process with a constant interest shown by our staff (1 report / 100 days of hospitalization which equals nearly 2 reports a day).
All incidents are analyzed.
Some are then chosen for their impact and improvement potential and presented to hospital staff at monthly morbidity and mortality (M


Abstract
Frailty is the most problematic expression of population ageing.
It is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in many physiological systems during a lifetime leading to functional dependence.
It is before the onset of functional dependence that detection of the frailty by the general practitioner is essential in order to tend to compress morbidity.
After an attempt for operational definition of frailty this paper reviews methodological, semantic and logistical pitfalls of screening for frailty in general medicine.
The use of frailty would allow general practitioners to introduce early interventions in the care for the older person, thus shifting the care towards a preventive course and thereby reducing the adverse outcomes as well as the public costs.


Abstract
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care in human medicine for gall bladder disease.
Although infrequently reported in veterinary literature, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an option for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in canine patients.
Due to the risk of cystic duct ligature slippage or clip dislodgement, we wanted to explore the use of a LigaTie; a novel absorbable medical device modeled after a cable tie.
Our object was to describe the use of the LigaTie in a caprine cadaveric study of cholecystectomies as a model for canine patients and demonstrate the leak pressure of the cystic duct compared with cholecystectomies performed with 2 large endoscopic hemoclips.
Samples of caprine gall bladder, liver, and cystic duct were collected.
The cystic duct was ligated with either 2 large endoscopic hemoclips or a LigaTie.
Maximum cystic duct pressure was recorded.
Results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the maximum cystic duct pressure achieved for cystic ducts ligated with 2 large endoscopic hemoclips or the LigaTie ( P = 0.865).
No leakage was observed from the cystic duct, hemoclip, or LigaTie site in either group.
Supraphysiologic pressures were achieved in both groups and high pressure occlusion of the infusion pump determined the maximum intraluminal pressure achieved.
Based on these results, the LigaTie may provide advantages in minimally invasive surgery, especially when considering ligation of a friable or thickened cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Future in vivo studies are warranted to determine minimally invasive maneuverability, tissue interaction, complications, and outcomes.


Abstract
Aortic arch anomalies are relatively frequent and account for 15 to 20 % of all congenital cardiovascular malformations.
They can be discovered in case of symptoms of airway or esophageal compression such as dysphagia, chronic cough, stridor, wheezing and recurrent respiratory infections.
We report the cases of two children with encircling aortic arch anomaly.
The 3-year-old boy had complained of chronic respiratory symptoms such as laryngitis and asthma since the age of 4 months.
The 20-month-old boy presented with inter-mittent stridor, dysphagia and frequent vomiting.
In both patients, the cervico-thoracic CT-scan showed a right aortic arch with retro-esophageal left subclavian artery and Kommerell's diverticulum.
Surgery was curative.
The understanding of normal and abnormal embryologic development of the aortic arch, and the knowledge of the different types of vascular compression and their clinical signs are mandatory for the early diagnosis and adequate treatment of such malformations.


Abstract
A century and a half after its first description, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) has revealed only part of its secrets.
Its definition remains clinical since the imaging technology we have at our dis-posal is insufficiently sensitive and specific.
Next to its idiopathic form, the most frequent and the most characteristic, there are numerous situations inducing a functional limitation of the glenohumeral joint and of its environment.
The clinical course inexorably takes place in one to two years, and develops in 3 phases where successively pain, retraction, and then recovery, as a rule complete recovery, dominate.
No treatment is likely to shorten it.
In the absence of clearly established proof, our therapeutic approach must be prudent and conservative.


Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and smoking are risk factors for adverse outcomes in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).
In a tertiary care hospital at Belgaum in the South Indian State of Karnataka, all TB patients aged ≥18 years consecutively diagnosed from February to September 2012 were evaluated for DM and smoking.
Of 307 TB patients, 35.5% were found to have DM, 9.8% were current smokers, and 3.6% had DM and were also smokers.
Measures to assess and address both these factors need to be taken into account during TB treatment.


Abstract
Telemedicine comprises different concepts aiming to close a spatial distance between practitioner, medical staff and patient.
Its functionality can include mere data transmission but extend as well to triggering alarms or enable consultation and therapy suggestions.
A special form of telemedicinal application is interventional decentralized telemonitoring.
Here practitioner-patient communication is characterized by telemedicinal data collection driven therapy-control and -optimization.
To identify feasible indications for the employment of telemonitoring a detailed definition of communicated parameters, alarm rules and algorithms of intervention are required as well as a benefit-cost analysis.
The quality of the telemedical application is determined by the medical quality of the resulting actions.


Abstract
Contemporary medicine is facing major and disruptive changes. These changes are unavoidable if one looks to the lackluster results.
The real drivers for these necessary changes are external.
The three major ones are the financial crisis, the public report on worldwide lack of efficiency and the ever growing request for transparency coming from users, political decision makers and payers.
It is high time that the medical community awakes and becomes instrumental to the reform of the medical ecosystem.


Abstract
Hand burns in children are frequent, severe, and require adequate treatment.
A fundamental, though problematic aspect of this treatment is the assessment of the burn depth as this determines the surgical strategy.
From a retrospective study of 369 hand burns admitted to our clinic, we were able to identify some patterns.
A total of 14.91% required surgery, with varying etiology among these patients.
Differences were also noticed in the number of days post-burn prior to surgical intervention.
The patterns revealed by our results are reviewed in order to improve therapeutic strategy.


Abstract
Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, the psychosocial management of persons living with HIV remains complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.
An auto-evaluation scale of psychosocial difficulties and needs was used by a team of nurses working in an HIV outpatient clinic.
After 3 years of experience, this well-accepted tool revealed a high prevalence of psychosocial difficulties within this population, including psychological health, financial situation and sexual life.
This instrument also allowed implementing a number of targeted nurse interventions to improve the management of these patients.


Abstract
Neurological symptoms are very common in children with life-limiting conditions and are challenging in terms of burden of illness.
Moreover, neurological symptoms can significantly impact the child's quality of life and contribute to distress among parents, families, caregivers and health care providers.
Knowing how to manage and alleviated these symptoms is essential for providing good palliative care.
In the present article, the more common neurological symptoms of agitation/irritability, spasticity and dystonia will be reviewed.
