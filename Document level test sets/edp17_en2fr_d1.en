Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma of the softpalate: review and case report

Introduction
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a rare malignant tumor that is found almost exclusively in the minor salivary glands.
It frequently occurs in patients between 30 and 70 years old, with a female to male ratio of 2/1.
It is usually located in the hard or soft palate.

Observation
A 38-year-old female patient presented with a bluish swelling in the right side of the soft palate which had evolved for a year, which was painless and covered with a mucosa of normal appearance.
The first diagnosis suggested was pleomorphic adenoma, but the histologic exam following the surgical biopsy revealed a PLGA.
Surgical revision of the safety margins was necessary together with mucosal plasty.

Discussion
The diagnosis of PLGA is based mainly on clinical and radiological aspects, but a histologic exam is absolutely necessary to confirm it, and for classification of the lesion.
Treatment is mainly surgical.
The prognosis is good, although the recurrence rate is 17% to 24%.
Although seldom, metastases in regional lymph nodes may occur in 9% of cases.

Conclusion
PLGA is a non-aggressive tumor whose prognosis depends on several factors including the consultation period. This highlights the importance of early detection.

Title
Discovery of squamous cell carcinoma of the retromolar trigone in a young adult without risk factors

Introduction
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is usually diagnosed in a context of alcohol and tobacco intoxication in patients between 50 and 60 years of age.
Cases of OSCC are increasingly found in young patients without any of the usual risk factors, resulting in diagnostic uncertainty and poor prognosis.

Case report
This article reports a case of late diagnosis of mandibular OSCC in a young 27-year-old male patient with no risk factors.
Despite surgical treatment combined with targeted chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient did not survive.

Discussion
Interpretation of clinical data might help in understanding what underlies early development of these cancers and their aggressiveness.

Title
Potential of mouthguards for enhancing sport and physical performances: a review of 50 years of medical research

Introduction
Since their appearance in the 1890s, mouthguards have been the subject of numerous research studies.
Based on the results of these studies, the use of mouthguard is recommended for the prevention of orofacial lesions in some sports.
Since the mid-1960, a new type of mouthguard appeared: the performance mouthguard.
According to its manufacturers and creators, this appliance particularly enables to improve endurance, strength, muscular power, reaction time, precision of movements, recovery capacity, range of motion, concentration and proprioception, and to decrease fatigue and stress.

Literature review
A review of 50 years of medical research on performance mouthguards shows contradictory results.
This reflects the inhomogeneity of studies which focus on different mouthguards, parameters recorded, muscular groups and sports.

Conclusion
At the moment, the enhancement of performance by using a mouthguard is an assumption.
However, the latest blinded controlled clinical trials tend to validate this assumption.
Harmonization of research protocols would allow this assumption to become evidence.

Title
Implantology and oral mucosal lesions: a literature review

Introduction
Recent developments in implantology have led to an extension of its indications, especially regarding special care patients.
This paper offers a review of the literature on the subject of implantology in cases of oral mucosal lesions.

Methods
A review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, without a date range, searching for articles describing oral implant treatments in patients with oral mucosal alterations.

Results
Few cases of oral implant treatments in such patients are described.
The results of the literature review showed that oral implant treatments greatly enhance the quality of life of these patients.

Discussion
Although these pathologies used to be considered contraindications to dental implant placement, recent data shows the feasibility of such treatments.

Conclusion
Nonetheless, both strict oral hygiene and regular maintenance are essential to intercept any potential pathology reactivation.

Title
Advantages of mouthguards for preventing orofacial lesions related to military and sport activities

Introduction
In the army, the occurrence of orofacial lesions related to military and sport activities can have a deleterious impact on the operational capability of soldiers and their units.
While mouthguards, also called Intrabuccal Guards ( IBGs), are used in a civilian context to decrease the incidence and severity of orofacial lesions of traumatic origin, there is, at the moment, no recommendation for IBG use in the French army.

Literature review
A review of the literature with regard to the use of IBGs for preventing the occurrence of orofacial lesions during military and sport activities allows us to elaborate recommendations for the French forces: a free-of-charge adaptable IBG for all soldiers, and in particular for soldiers aged less than 25 years old belonging to a combat unit.

Conclusion
The use of IBGs by soldiers needs to be recommended or mandatory for some sport activities (according to civilian recommendations) and mandatory for some military activities (obstacle course and unarmed combat), especially during the basic military training.
To be efficient, these recommendations should be included in a global strategy of prevention of orofacial lesions of traumatic origin in the army with the education of soldiers and health professionals (physicians and dentists).

Title
Surgical indications of the iatrogenic injuries of the infra-alveolar nerve and lingual nerve: literature review

Introduction
Infra alveolar nerve (IAN) and lingual nerve (LN) lesions are the most important iatrogenic lesions in oral surgery.
The objective of this review of the literature was to clarify the best way to rise to the indication for surgical treatment of these lesions.

Material and methods
The key words from the MeSH database (“Iatrogenic Disease”[Mesh] OR “Trauma, Nervous System”[Mesh] OR “Medical Errors”[Mesh]) AND (“Lingual Nerve”[Mesh] OR “Lingual Nerve Injuries”[Mesh] OR “Mandibular Nerve”[Mesh]) were applied to the PubMed database.
Articles published between 2004 and 2014 were selected if they dealt with etiology, diagnosis or treatment of IAN or LN iatrogenic injuries.

Results
Of 256 references, 22 were included.
Different clinical tests are used to evaluate symptoms but no consensual method is identified.
The consensus does not exist either for indication to surgical treatment.
Data collected demonstrates a good efficiency of surgery with 80 to 90% of patients who achieved Functional Sensorial Recovery.
Iatrogenic IAN and LN injuries are too often simply supervised while in some cases surgery must be the first intention with early treatment.

Conclusion
This article presents the most standardised, methodology which can be easily used in routine clinical practice to evaluate intensity of lesion and establish the indication for surgical treatment when it is necessary.

Title
AL lingual amyloidosis complicating multiple myeloma: case report and review of the literature

Introduction
Multiple myeloma is a condition characterized by intramedullary malignant plasma cell proliferation.
It is manifested by the massive synthesis of a monoclonal immunoglobulin-like paraprotein.
When this is a fragment of a light chain, it can be complicated by AL systemic amyloidosis.
Amyloid deposits in the tongue can then give rise to more or less debilitating macroglossia.
Lingual involvement has been poorly described in the literature.
A new severe case of AL lingual amyloidosis is reported.

Observation
A 62-year-old patient was referred for significant lingual discomfort associated with pain.
He had been suffering from multiple myeloma since 2006, initially treated with melphalan and an autologous graft and with several lines of chemotherapy depending on the progression of the condition.
AL amyloidosis was suggested in 2014 after the occurrence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.
During its surgical treatment, a synovial biopsy revealed the presence of amyloid deposits.
Physical examination revealed macroglossia with lateral indentations.
The tongue was stiff, indurated and painful on palpation.
The patient reported severe feeding difficulty (dysphagia, pain on swallowing, inability to swallow solid food), leading to a deterioration of his general condition with weight loss.
Phonation was altered, and oral hygiene was compromised.
A biopsy and pathological examination confirmed the lingual localization of amyloidosis.
An occlusal adjustment of the posterior teeth was performed and a local infiltration of triamcinolone was administered, but no clinical improvement was obtained.

Discussion
Amyloidosis is a disease defined by the deposition and extracellular accumulation of a protein substance called “amyloid”.
It can affect one or more organs, and disturbs their architecture and function.
AL amyloidosis (“primitive” amyloidosis) is typically secondary to plasma cell proliferation as in multiple myeloma.
In this condition, the amyloid fibrils are formed by the polymerization of fragments of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains.
Oral manifestations may be the first signs of the disease.
The principle of the treatment is to reduce the protein amount by acting on the underlying monoclonal proliferation.
The prognosis then depends on the reduction of the serum free light chain.
Due to a lack of data and evidence, there is no consensus on the specific management of macroglossia due to systemic amyloidosis.
Surgical treatment by partial glossectomy may be considered in case of major functional or esthetic impotence, insofar as the underlying monoclonal proliferation is stopped.
In this reported case, the significance of the functional impairment due to macroglossia required symptomatic management.
The risk of recurrence, the unpredictability of the postoperative results and the significant morbidity inherent in glossectomy meant that this treatment was not considered at first.
In active cases of systemic amyloidosis with a blocked throat, alternative measures such as tracheostomy and gastrostomy may be the best solutions to enable an acceptable quality of life.

Conclusion
AL amyloidosis is a multisystemic disease with a poor prognosis: the life expectancy without treatment is less than 1 year.
In progressive cases, maintaining the patient’s quality of life and protecting the vital functions are essential.

Title
The complexity of the management of cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) in dentistry and oral surgery: case report and literature review

Introduction
Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), previously known as cleidocranial dysostosis, is a rare genetic disease, with highly variable and inconsistent clinical forms.

Observations
A case report, treated in collaboration between the surgical and orthodontic departments of the Center of Consultation and Dental Treatment of Casablanca, illustrates this subject.
A 22-year-old male patient complaining of delayed eruption of the upper right incisors was referred to the department of oral surgery of this center.
Clinical and radiographic information gathered from this examination (a clavicular defect, dental abnormalities and craniofacial anomalies) suggested a diagnosis of cleidocranial dysplasia.
The dental care objectives were to correct the dental abnormalities, extract the supernumerary teeth and correct the position of the permanent teeth to obtain a functional, lasting and esthetic occlusion.

Discussion
CCD causes various skeletal, clavicular and odontostomatological abnormalities.
The dental signs of cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) often lead to early diagnosis; thus, the treatment is mainly centered on the orofacial sphere, and concerns all dental disciplines.
Nowadays, therapeutic strategies are based on the pathophysiology of this condition and mostly lead to good results, justifying the long treatment periods, affecting both patients and specialists.

Conclusion
A multidisciplinary approach involving the generalist, the oral surgeon, the maxillofacial surgeon and the orthodontist is absolutely necessary to correct the hypoplasia of the facial skeleton and the dental abnormalities in cleidocranial dysplasia.

Title
Cherubism: a 10-year follow-up case report and literature review

Introduction
Cherubism, or familial fibrous dysplasia of the jaws, was described in 1933 by Jones.
Cherubism is characterized by bilateral maxillary swelling, induced by osteoclastic hyperactivity during childhood.

Observation
A 4.5-year-old patient consulted for swelling of the lower third of the face.
Monitoring over a period of 10 years showed abnormalities of the number and eruption of teeth.
Surgical-othodontic traction was performed.

Discussion
Most authors recommend no treatment during the phase of osteoclasis.
Drug treatments require additional studies to assess the risk-benefit.
Orthodontic and implant treatments are indicated after puberty for treatment of the dental consequences of cherubism.

Conclusion
Using a concerted and rational multidisciplinary approach, surgical-orthodontic treatment is possible in an adolescent affected by cherubism.

Title
Myoepithelioma of minor salivary glands. A case report

Abstract
Myoepithelioma, presently classified as a « distinct » clinical and pathological entity, is a rare benign salivary gland neoplasm.
A case, which occurred in the minor salivary glands in a 36 years-old man, is reported.
Following clinical inspection showing a normally limited swelling without color change of the muccosa, a benign salivary gland neoplasm was suspected.
Histological examinations as well as immunochemical investigations confirmed the myoepithelial nature of the tumor.
However, the diagnosis of this neoplasm remains controversial since a wide range of clinical and histological features can be display.
Cytoarchitectural patterns and immunochemical profiles are also crucial for identification and avoid potential misdiagnosis.

Title
Pyostomatitis vegetans: case report and literaturereview

Introduction
Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare dermatosis which is manifested by yellowish-white pustules and inflammatory vesiculous lesions of the oral mucosa in the gum, the vestibule, the soft and hard palate, and sometimes the lips.
PV is often associated with inflammatory bowel chronic diseases (IBDs) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

Observation
An 80-year-old patient with Crohn’s disease consulted for linear ulceration localized on the lower labial vestibule of the left cheek and on the right upper vestibule.
The PV diagnosis was made after biopsy and the lesions regressed under local corticosteroid application.

Discussion
The characteristic symptoms and histology (negative direct and indirect immunofluorescence) enable the diagnosis of PV and eliminate pemphigus vegetans and pyoderma gangrenosum.
Peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophils on a histological section may be useful for monitoring disease activity.
Treatment is based on local or systemic corticosteroids depending on the intensity of the oral and gastrointestinal involvement.

Conclusion
Upon discovery of PV lesions, testing for IBDs is critical in order to establish a treatment as early as possible.

Title
Epidemiology of dental and maxillofacial trauma in CENHOSOA, Antananarivo

Introduction
The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of dental and maxillofacial fractures in Antananarivo ( MADAGASCAR).

Methods
A retrospective study from January 2003 to August 2012 was carried out.
Selected records recounted maxillofacial and dental trauma for patients admitted to the “Centre Hospitalier de Soavinandriana” (CENHOSOA), Antananarivo.

Results
Of the 166 collected cases, males predominated (83.1%) and the most affected age was between 26 and 35 years old.
The most frequent causes were traffic accidents (34.9%) and assaults (32.5%).
Mandibular fractures and zygomatic (malar) fractures were the most numerous, with the same frequency of 25.3%, and the frequency of alveolodental fractures was 10.8%.

Discussion
Our results were similar to those observed in the literature.
The typical patient was a young adult male.
This feature is primarily associated with traffic accidents and assaults.
Bone relief structures of the face are most commonly affected because they are the most exposed.
Injuries occur especially during weekends or holidays.
The concept of alcohol is often mentioned, but in our study, it was only declared in 12.7% of cases.

Title
Oral verrucous carcinoma treated with methotrexate

Introduction
Oral verrucous carcinoma should be considered as low-grade carcinoma malignancy.
The standard surgical treatment is not always possible for the extended forms.
Medical treatment is controversial.
A case of oral verrucous carcinoma treated with intravenous infusions of methotrexate was reported.

Observation
A patient with a lip and jugal verrucous carcinoma was treated with 4 intravenous cycles of methotrexate 40 mg/m2.
After the first two treatments, a significant partial remission of the lesions was observed.
Treatment with two new cures was performed and completed by the surgical removal of a persistent labial lesion.

Discussion
The treatment of verrucous carcinoma by methotrexate infusion is an alternative to surgery.
The regimen is empirical and needs to be evaluated.

Title
Management for patients with bleeding disorders and dental extractions: Effectiveness, Tolerance and Compliance

Introduction
This study evaluated the effectiveness, tolerance and compliance of patients with the protocol of the service for the prevention of bleeding after dental extraction in patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand's disease (VWD) or platelet disorders.

Patients and Methods
This study prospectively included all patients needing dental extractions and who had blood hemostasis diseases from February 2013 to February 2014, in the regional hospital center of Lille.
Replacement therapy such as desmopressin, clotting factor or platelet concentrates as well as local hemostatic methods were used.
At the post-operative consultation, patients were asked about the onset of pain, bleeding, complications and the assessment of comfort.

Results
Thirty-seven patients were included.
Bleeding occurred in thirteen patients (35.14%).
Patients evaluated their comfort at 8.77/10 at the hospital and 8.40/10 at home.

Discussion
This protocol appears at least as effective as those found in the literature.
The main types of complications were pain, allergic reactions and infections.
Overall, patients are satisfied with this support.
Pluridisciplinary collaboration remains the most important thing for good management.

Title
Accidental displacement of third molar into the submandibular space: two case reports

Introduction
The accidental displacement of the wisdom tooth into nearby spaces is a rare, but possible complication during extraction.

Case report
We report two cases of accidental displacement of mandibular third molars into the submandibular space.
Topographic diagnosis, treatment and the causes of this complication are discussed.

Discussion
Displacement may involve the sublingual space, pterygomandibular space and submandibular space for the third lower molars, and cellular spaces, maxillary sinus and pterygomaxillary fossa for the third upper molars.
The most frequent cause cited for these accidents, particularly for mandibular molars, was the lack of presurgery assessment of risk factors.
Good preoperative planning, careful radiographic evaluation, and mastery of the surgical technique are of crucial importance in reducing the incidence of these complications.

Title
Socket preservation using a xenograft material and a collagen membrane prior to an implant placement: technical note

Introduction
Management of a post-extraction socket is challenging.
Indeed, uncontrolled, the vertical and horizontal bone resorption could disrupt the ideal tridimensional placement of an implant.
The main goal of this article is to illustrate, step by step, an appropriate surgical technique to preserve the dental socket and to optimise the placement of the implant and the consecutive aesthetic prosthetic restoration.

Object
Firstly , an atraumatic dental extraction is carried out and the socket carefully curetted.
Then, the surgical site is preserved with a collagen membrane and resorbable sutures, not requiring a hermetic closure.
Second-line gingival healing indicates the success of the procedure.
During the healing time a non-compressive temporary prosthesis is used .
After 16 weeks and after clinical and radiological controls, the implant is placed in an osseous healing site in an ideal way in the 3 planes of the space.
Mucogingival “Mucogingival” surgery ensures an optimal aesthetic incorporation.
Twelve weeks later, implant loading is carried out in a safe site, in the most aesthetic way possible.

Conclusion
Optimal alveolar preservation by means of an appropriate surgical technique and careful management of the peri-implant site allows a predictable prosthetic restoration that will give complete satisfaction to the patient.

Title
Florid osseous dysplasia of the mandible: a case of fortuitous discovery and review

Introduction
Florid osseous dysplasia (DOF), formerly known as florid cemento-osseous dysplasia, is a disease stil l too often ignored by some physicians.

Objective
Our study’s aim was, from an illustrated case report, to carry out a review on the management of DOF.

Observation
A 38-year-old woman was referred by her orthodontist after the fortuitous discovery by X-ray of numerous mixed mandibular lesions, around the molar apex.
The diagnosis of DOF was made.

Discussion
Many cases of endodontic treatment failures of dental labeled cysts have been reported, turning out to be DOF.
Bad management of these lesions often led to the condition progressing to its symptomatic form.
It is therefore important not to disregard such pathology and seriously consider an indication of endodontic treatment.
It is now accepted that no treatment should be considered outside the phases of secondary infection and dental extractions should be avoided in the affected areas.
There are no recommendations concerning the orthodontic treatment feasibility.

Conclusion
Perfect oral hygiene and regular monitoring are essential in the management of these patients.

Title
Functional re-education in musculo-skeletal disorders of the manducatory apparatus: from its biological principles to clinical practice (4th part).

Introduction
Biological effects of re-education are under study in musculo-skeletal disorders (MSD).

Discussion
Re-education induces motor activity changes.
In neck-pain, it increases agonistic activity, it decreases synergistic and compensatory activity and antagonistic activity, and presumably it improves feed-forward motor regulation.
Moreover, re-education induces neuroplastic changes in cortical motor area (M1).
It is supposed that voluntary and cerebrally driven re-education would “short-circuit” segmental pain induced motor changes and would induce a switch from co-activation towards reciprocal inhibition motor strategy.
In muscle, exercises would: increase functional hyperheamia, induce capillary angiogenesis around muscle fibres, and increase oxidative metabolism and ATP rate in muscle fibres.
In temporo-mandibular disorders, mastication per se is not a means of re-education but physiological mastication is one of the goals of treatment.
In the long term, mastication could allow maintaining benefits of re-education both as far motor activity and muscle tissue changes are concerned.
In pain free subjects, tongue exercises induce neuroplastic changes i.e. it increases motor cortical map and cortico-bulbar motoneuron excitability of tongue muscles.

Conclusion
Supposedly functional re-education in MSD induces plastic changes from brain to muscle, but it is necessary to better understand its biological effects in order to define precisely the dosage of exercises.

Title
Granulomatous cheilitis of Miescher: diagnostic difficulty

Introduction
Granulomatous cheilitis of Miescher (GCM) is a swelling of the lips primary or secondary to an underlying disease.
The objective of this article is to report the difficulty of etiological diagnosis and various treatments available.

Observation
A 77 years woman has consulted for a chronic swelling of the lower lip.
Biopsy found multiple epithelioid granulomatous foci with giant cells without caseous necrosis.
The etiological diagnosis was refused by the patient.
Treatment with intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg was done successfully.

Discussion
GCM can be primary or secondary.
The etiological diagnosis is essential.
Treatment is reported as a challenge.

Title
A case of necrotizing stomatitis: noma of the richcountries?

Introduction
There are few cases of massive necrotizing stomatitis in immuno-compromised patients described in the literature and methotrexate has not been observed to induce such clinical manifestations.
We report the case of a severe necrotizing stomatitis, including spontaneous dental exfoliations in an immuno-compromised patient.

Case report
A 45-year-old female patient, treated by methotrexate (MTX) and infliximab, has developed oral mucosa ulcerations, suggesting a toxicity of MTX.
Even if MTX was stopped, ulcerations have increased, leading to underlying bone necrosis along with spontaneous exfoliation of several maxillary teeth.
Broad-spectrum antibiotherapy and parenteral nutrition have been established, which lead to a quick amelioration of general condition.
One month later, bone exposure concerned the anterior part of palate and mandible.
Bone sequestrums have been progressively removed and a complete mucosal closure was observed after 19 months.
Bacterial swabs have revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and histopathological examination showed evidence of bone necrosis.

Discussion
The medical history of denutrition and the clinical aspect of the lesions are close to the classical description of noma even if no extent towards soft tissues was observed.

Title
Ethmoido-fronto-maxillary sinusitis of dental origin:a case report

Introduction
Maxillary sinusitis is a common infection of the ENT sphere.
A dental origin is found in about 40% of cases.
The roots of the posterior maxillary teeth are adjacent to the sinus floor; extensions of dental infections are therefore possible to the nearby sinus.

Case report
A 27-year-old patient was admitted for a frontal and orbital tumefaction associated with homolateral odontalgia.
Investigations revealed fronto-ethmoido-maxillary sinusitis of dental origin.
Conventional radiographs and CT scans were required for the diagnosis and proper management.
Dental treatments combined with oral antibiotics to treat the infection were required.
Endoscopic meatotomy associated with the enlargement of the nasofrontal duct was necessary to complete the treatment and restore adequate sinusal function.
The evolution was favorable.

Comments and conclusion
This case is atypical due to its dental origin; it illustrates an unusual extension of an odontogenic infection to the maxillary and frontal sinus.

Title
Palatal compound melanocytic nevus in a 3-year-old boy

Introduction
Oral melanocytic nevi (OMN) are rare benign tumours of the oral mucosa.

Observation
The case of compound OMN of the palatal mucosa in a 3-year-old boy is reported.

Discussion
OMN and oral malignant melanoma (OMM) are localized preferentially to the palate and have a similar clinical appearance.
This is a histological diagnosis.
The potential malignant transformation of OMN has never been determined.

Title
Cancers of the oral cavity: a female-predominant incidence in Ouagadougou

Objective
We conducted a retrospective study with the aim of showing the characteristics of these cancers through a comparison between the two sexes at Yalgado Ouedraogo Teaching Hospital (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso).

Materials and Methods
A retrospective study from 79 medical files of patients consulting between January 2013 and December 2014 was conducted.
All of them were affected by a histological confirmed cancer of the oral cavity.
The demographic characteristics of the patients (age and gender) and main characteristics of the malign tumor (localization, histological type) were investigated.
Parameters were compared according to gender with the Student t-test.

Results
We collected 79 patients with an average age of 56 (standard deviation: 15 years).
The female predominance was clear (sex ratio = 0.55) and related to all the age groups.
The proportion of patients who had no job was about 90.2% for women versus 60.7% for men (p = 0.004).
The men were all smokers, while some women chewed tobacco.
Tongue cancer was more frequent in the male subject (32.1%), followed by palate cancer and cheek cancer.
Among women, the most frequent localizations were the lips (37.3%), the cheeks and the gum.
Men consulted at more advanced stages than women.
Epidermoid carcinoma was the prevalent histological type in both sexes.

Conclusion
Jointly with the classical risk factors, alcohol and tobacco addictions, the low soc io-economic level plays a significant role in this female prevalence.

Title
Osteoid osteoma of the mandible: a case report and review of the literature

Introduction
Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor preferentially affecting young adults, with a strong predilection for long bones.
It is rarely found in the head and neck.

Observation
In this paper, the case of a twenty-year-old patient who presented right mandibular pain is reported.
On examination, a maxillofacial trauma history was found.
X-ray examination showed a mixed lesion associated with the root of the right mandibular first molar.
Excision and apical resection of the tooth concerned was performed under local anesthesia.
Histopathological examination diagnosed osteoid osteoma.

Discussion
To date, only twenty-one cases of osteoid osteoma of the jaws have been reported in the literature, with a predominance of mandibular involvement.
The pathogenesis of osteoid osteoma remains unclear. However, a facial trauma history has been found in several patients.

Conclusion
Regular follow-up of the patient is essential because, although recurrence or malignant transformation are seldom, they do exist.

Title
Clinical and radiological features of Jacob’sdisease. A case report involving an osteochondroma of the coronoidprocess

Introduction
A large number of disorders affecting the masticatory system can cause mouthopening restrictions.
Among them is Jacob’s disease, characterized by restricted jaw movements and caused by pressure of the mandible coronoid process, which is longer than normal in size, on the posterior aspect of the zygomatic arch, together establishing new joint formation.

Observation
We present a case report of a 29-year-old male patient presenting limited mouth opening. Inter-incisal maximum mouth opening was 5 mm.
On panoramic radiograph an elongated coronoid process of the mandible was evident.
Computed tomography (CT) scans showed the relationship between the exophytic mass and the inner surface of the zygomatic arch.
An extra-oral coronoidectomy was performed.
A mouth opening of 55 mm was achieved intra-operatively. The post-operative period was without complications.
The histopathological diagnosis was osteochondroma.

Discussion
The clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics and surgical approach to Jacob’s disease are discussed.

Conclusion
In a patient with a limitation of mouth opening, and without any temporo-mandibular joint disease, an examination of the coronoid process is required to identify hypertrophy ofthe coronoid process and to diagnose Jacob’s disease.

Title
Effects of prosthesis splinting or not on peri-implant bone loss: a prospective clinical study with a 5-year follow-up period

Introduction
The study presented sought to demonstrate a possible relation between the splinting of crowns on short implants (6–8 mm long) placed in the posterior mandibular sector and bone loss around these implants.

Materials and methods
The sample of patients participating in this multicenter prospective study included the first 54 patients included in a study on short implants.
Their inclusion required that they present a mandibular free posterior gap, with bone height between 8 and 10 mm, as well as a bone ridge greater than 6 mm above the alveolar canal.
Treatment comprised implanting prostheses onto implants, with the number of implants identical to the number of teeth to be replaced.
Bone loss around the implants was measured radiologically during surgical placement and then once a year for 5 years.

Results
At 5 years, based on the number of patients presenting at the follow-up visit, 89 implants were assessed.
One hundred percent of the implants placed were still in place.
Peri-implant bone loss was a mean 0.69 mm (SD 1.29). It seems there were few significant differences in terms of bone loss whether or not the crowns were splinted.
Mean bone loss around the splinted implants versus non-splinted implants was compared using a t-test comparing the two means with equal variances based on the hypothesis that there would be no difference between splinting and non-splinting crowns.

Conclusion
Despite the limitations of this study, the small sample and post-hoc analysis, we obtained a preliminary quantitative assessment that splinting prostheses seems to have little impact on peri-implant bone loss.

Title
A histologic variant of ameloblastoma: the acanthomatous type

Introduction
Ameloblastoma is the most common aggressive benign odontogenic tumor of the jaws.
This kind of tumor arises from dental embryonic remnants.

Clinical case
We report a case of acanthomatous ameloblastoma of the mandible occurring in a 79-year-old male patient.
Through this case, we describe clinical and radiological findings in ameloblastoma, discuss different variants of this tumor, and emphasize the histological diagnosis.

Discussion
Among the various types of aggressive benign odontogenic tumors, acanthomatous ameloblastoma represents a subtype of the solid multicystic ameloblastoma with specific microscopic features.
Its course is controversial.

Conclusion
Although the diagnosis of acanthomatous ameloblastoma is based on histologic features, dentists and oral surgeons should consider this possibility in patients with an aggressive tumoral process.

Title
Epidemiology of facial fractures: an analysis of 349 patients

Introduction
Facial fractures epidemiology varies with geographic region.
Patients and methods: This study reports the frequency, demographic characteristics and aetiologies of facial fractures in a 5-year retrospective survey, in Burkina Faso.

Results
In 349 patients, the fracture involved the mandible (44.5%), the zygomatic complex (38.9%), the maxilla (13.8%) or the naso-fronto-orbito-ethmoidal complex (2.8%).
The peak of frequency (58.2%) was recorded between 20 and 39 years and the male to female ratio was 7.1:1.
The aetiologies of the fractures were road traffic crashes (80.5%), assaults (9.7%), falls (8.3%), and sport accidents (1.5%).
In 80% of the road traffic accidents, a two-wheeled vehicle was involved and 75.9% of falls were from a tree height.
There was a significant association between multiple facial fractures and road traffic accidents.

Discussion
Epidemiology of facial fractures in this study is similar to that generally reported in developing countries.
Frequency of falls from trees height constitutes however a particularity.
These findings illustrate the necessity of enforcement of road traffic security, as well as a development of program of prevention of falls from trees, in Burkina Faso.

Title
Atypical manifestations of giant cell arteritis: Case report and literature review

Introduction
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis commonly affecting patients after the fifth decade.
Atypical clinical manifestations can induce a wrong diagnosis that can lead to dramatic damages.

Observation
A 63-year-old woman had been sent to oral surgery department for maxillary pain, after being seen by a dentist and an endodontist: a dental origin had wrongly been suspected.
Besides several symptoms (orofacial pain, asthenia, anorexia), clinical abnormalities of the right temporal artery evoked the diagnosis of GCA.
She had been sent quickly to the rheumatology service for confirmation of the diagnosis and special care.

Discussion
Inflammation of branches of aortic artery lead to several clinical manifestations, resulting sometimes in atypical expressions.
The potentially severe consequences of the disease (irreversible blindness, ischemic stroke) compel an immediate corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusion
The large variety of clinical manifestations of the GCA has to be known by the dental surgeon, to be able to identify atypical symptoms and to send his patient as soon as possible to the specialist.

Title
Osteonecrosis induced by bisphosphonates in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta

Introduction
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary diseases characterized by bone fragility and usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
The overall incidence of OI is about one in 10,000 births.
The clinical picture is dominated by musculoskeletal manifestations.
Bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice for OI.

Observation
We describe the case of a woman aged 30 years with osteogenesis imperfecta type 4 treated with bisphosphonates.
The chief complaint was the appearance of bone denudation at the left premolar site after tooth extraction.
The management was medical-surgical.

Discussion
OI is a rare genetic disease.
Medical treatment with bisphosphonates is the therapy of choice for moderate and severe forms.
However bisphosphonates have side effects: the best known is osteonecrosis, which is defined by the persistence of exposed bone area in the maxillofacial region for over eight weeks in a patient who received or is receiving treatment with bisphosphonates, who had not been exposed to craniofacial radiotherapy.
The risk of developing osteonecrosis is related to the type of bisphosphonate, dose, and duration of treatment.

Title
Ultrasound-assisted self-metathesis reactions of monounsaturated fatty acids

Abstract
An efficient protocol for the self-metathesis of oleic acid, using ruthenium catalysts is described.
The self-metathesis reaction under ultrasonic activation allows the conversion of monoenic fatty acids such as oleic acid, elaidic acid and erucic acid into diacids and olefins with very short reaction times in the presence of Grubbs ruthenium catalysts.
These yields and selectivity towards the desired products are influenced by the nature of solvents.
This study demonstrated that metathesis reaction carried out in DCM or 1-butanol showed promising results, since it produced a variety of products, like n-alkenes and diacids with good yields (45–75%) and high selectivities (75–95%).

Title
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) requirement for brain development: A personal view

Abstract
Dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is known to accumulate in the infant brain and clinical trials have established that dietary DHA is associated with improvements in visual and neural function in preterm infants.
Thus, an elevated DHA status is considered to be important throughout infancy for brain development.
While DHA can be added directly to infant foods, there have been important studies to show that infants can partially meet their own DHA requirements by consuming adequate levels of omega 3 alpha linolenic acid (ALA).
A key requirement to allow for the conversion of ALA to DHA and to maximise its incorporation into tissues is a diet that is also low in omega 6 linoleic acid (LA).
Such diets are hard to find commercially because dietary guidelines dictate that ~3% energy of infant diets should be in the form of LA.
These estimates were based on early animal experiments in which basal diets were devoid of both LA and ALA.
However, recent animal experiments have indicated that the level of LA required to avoid essential fatty acid deficiency is much lower when ALA is also present in the diet.
When a wide range diets are evaluated in animal systems, it is possible to see that the level of DHA found in the blood of animals fed diets containing only LA and ALA can reach levels similar to that of animals fed diets rich in fish oil, but only when the ALA:LA ratio is high and the total amount of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is low.
Diets that are rich in either monounsaturates or saturates meet these requirements.
Importantly, there are human infant studies that have tested such diets and demonstrated that human infants accumulate greater amounts of DHA than when diets are high in LA.
It might be time to reconsider the dietary requirement of the two essential fatty acids LA and ALA in human infants in terms of their ability to enhance endogenous synthesis of DHA rather than more adult biomarkers like cholesterol levels.

Title
Impact of the gut microbiota on the neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress in rodents

Abstract
The gastro-intestinal tract hosts a complex microbial ecosystem, the gut microbiota, whose collective genome coding capacity exceeds that of the host genome.
The gut microbiota is nowadays regarded as a full organ, likely to contribute to the development of pathologies when its dynamic balance is disrupted (dysbiosis).
In the last decade, evidence emerged that the gut microbiota influences brain development and function.
In particular, comparisons between germ-free and conventional laboratory rodents showed that the absence of the gut microbiota exacerbates the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) system reactivity to stress and alters the anxiety-like behaviour.
Furthermore, the dysfunctions observed in germ-free animals can be corrected if the gut microbiota is restored in early life but not in adulthood, suggesting a critical period for microbiota imprinting on the responsiveness to stress.
The modes of action are still to be deciphered.
They may involve transport of neuroactive bacterial metabolites to the brain through the bloodstream, stimulation of the vagus nerve or of entero-endocrine cells, or modulation of the immune system and, consequently, of the inflammatory status.
The discovery that the gut microbiota regulates the neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress paves the way for the hypothesis that gut microbiota dysbioses could contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety-related disorders.
In this regard, treatments of anxiety-prone rodent strains with probiotics or antibiotics aimed at modifying their gut microbiota have shown an anxiolytic-like activity.
Clinical trials are now needed to know if results obtained in preclinical studies can translate to humans.

Title
Role of n-3 PUFAs in inflammation via resolvin biosynthesis

Abstract
The role of n-3 PUFAs has gained more importance these last decades, especially in inflammatory processes because they can display anti-inflammatory properties.
Inflammation is a protective response of the body in controlling infection and promoting tissue repair.
However, excessive inflammation can cause local tissue damage.
This is especially the case for the brain for which the functional consequences of neuroinflammation include alterations in cognition, affect and behavior leading to a negative impact on the quality of life and well-being of patients (Dantzer, 2001, 2008).
Hence, limiting the inflammation in the brain is a real strategy for neuroinflammatory disease therapy and treatment.
Recent data show that n-3 PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties in part through the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators such as resolvins that actively turned off the inflammatory response.
This review first outlines basic concepts of neuroinflammation and the role of n-3 PUFAs in this process and then summarizes the biosynthesis, signaling pathways and role of resolvins.

Title
Long-chain omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cognition in older people: interaction with APOE genotype

Abstract
Basic research and epidemiological studies suggest a protective effect of long-chain omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) against age-related cognitive decline.
However, most randomized controlled trials with LC n-3 PUFA supplements have yielded disappointing results on cognitive outcomes in older persons.
One explanation for this discrepancy may be an inadequate targeting of potential beneficiaries of LC n-3 PUFA according to their Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
The aim of this paper was to examine the potential modifying effect of APOE genotype on LC n-3 PUFA metabolism and its relation to cognitive decline in older persons.
At least five epidemiological studies and three intervention studies with LC n-3 PUFA supplements have found an interaction between LC n-3 PUFA and APOE genotype on cognition.
However, the direction of the effect is inconsistent across studies: the impact of LC n-3 PUFA on cognition is stronger in APOE4 carriers (the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease) in some studies, but conversely stronger in APOE4 non-carriers in other studies.
These discordant results may be explained by different age groups, cognitive status, measures of cognition, or amounts of DHA intake across studies.
Experimental studies suggest that the APOE4 genotype modifies the metabolism of DHA.
The APOE genotype should be systematically taken into account and interactions tested in epidemiological and intervention studies with LC n-3 PUFA.
Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this gene X diet interaction.

Title
Early life exposure to polyunsaturated fatty acids and psychomotor development in children from the EDEN mother-child cohort

Abstract
Epidemiological studies have reported that breastfed children have improved psychomotor development compared to never breastfed children.
Human studies suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially long chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) which are highly contained in breast milk, could explain this link, since they are needed for pre- and postnatal brain development.
Our aim was to study the relationships between several measures of pre- and postnatal exposures to PUFA and child’s psychomotor development at 2 and 3 years in the EDEN cohort.
We evaluated breastfeeding duration, colostrum PUFA levels and maternal dietary PUFA intake during pregnancy, that we related with three scores of psychomotor development, after taking into account potential confounders.
Breastfeeding duration was positively associated with psychomotor development.
No relationship was found with both pre- and postnatal exposure to LC-PUFA.
However, the maternal dietary omega-6/omega-3 ratio was negatively associated with psychomotor development, mainly driven by intake in linoleic acid (LA).
Among breastfed children, linoleic acid levels were negatively associated with psychomotor development.
Furthermore, children exposed to the highest colostrum LA levels tended to score closer to never breastfed children than to children exposed to the lowest colostrums LA levels.
Taken together, these results do not provide evidence in favour of a positive role of pre- and postnatal exposure to LC-PUFA on later psychomotor development, but highlight a potential negative role of being exposed in early life to high LA levels.
From a public health perspective, this work reiterates the need to promote breastfeeding duration, and to monitor the balance of PUFA intake during pregnancy and lactation periods.

Title
Differential attractiveness of sunflower cultivars to the honeybee Apis mellifera L.

Abstract
In France, sunflower honey production has decreased since the nineties and professional beekeepers report important honey yield variability between years and locations.
Consequently, melliferous potential of current sunflower cultivars is questioned as it is not part of traits held in breeding programs.
To investigate this question, a 3-years study was conducted on two sites and attractiveness for honeybees of 13 current sunflower cultivars was assessed under natural conditions.
The number of honeybee visits per plant was recorded daily during blooming period on cultivars randomly distributed on experimental plots.
Sunflower genetic was a major factor influencing honeybee attendance on plots and discrepancy between most and least visited cultivars reached a factor of 3.
Cultivars relative attractiveness was consistent between years and sites.
Potential link between sunflower attractiveness for honeybees and its melliferous characteristics is discussed.
If confirmed, farmers’ choice concerning cultivars at a territory scale could contribute to enhance nectar resource for pollinators and to increase viability of apicultural activity.

Title
Very long-chain fatty acids support synaptic structure and function in the mammalian retina

Abstract
Elongation of Very Long chain fatty acids-like 4 (ELOVL4) is a fatty acid elongase responsible for the biosynthesis of very long chain (VLC; ≥ C26) fatty acids in the retina, brain, skin, Meibomian gland, and testes.
Heterozygous inheritance of mutant ELOVL4 causes juvenile macular degeneration in autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3).
Retinal photoreceptors are enriched with VLC polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs), which have been shown by our group and others to be necessary for the survival of rod photoreceptors.
Our group performed a series of studies using mice conditionally depleted of retinal Elovl4 (KO) aimed at understanding the role of VLC-PUFAs in long-term retinal health and function, focusing on the role of these fatty acids in mediating synaptic function between the photoreceptors and the rest of the neural retina.
The absence of VLC-PUFA from the retina of KO mice resulted in a marked decrease in retinal b-wave responses of the electroretinogram as well as a decrease in the amplitude of the oscillatory potentials mediated by the neural retina.
Although there were no measureable differences between KO and wild type (WT) mice in either pre-synaptic rod calcium channel function or post-synaptic bipolar cell glutamate receptor responses, ultrastructural analysis revealed a marked decrease in the diameter of synaptic vesicles in rod terminals.
Recent quantification suggests that this decrease in synaptic vesicle size due to the absence of VLC-PUFAs in KO mice, and the consequent decrease in glutamate content, could account for the decrease in b-wave response amplitudes that were previously measured in these animals.

Title
Olive oil: an overview of the Japanese market

Abstract
The article presents an overview of olive oil consumption in Japan, Asia’s largest per capita consumer and at present 14th in the world.
Since the early 1990s, total purchases have increased from 4943 t in the 1992/93 campaign to 61 903 t in 2014/15, a more than 12-fold increase over the space of 22 years.
Olive oil, in particular extra virgin olive oil, is appreciated by Japanese people primarily for its beneficial effects on health, as well as for its agreeable taste and for its cultural and historical associations.
Other key factors to be considered are economic and cultural.
Japan is one of the world’s largest economies; disposable incomes are high and these are reflected in household consumption behavior.
Culturally, the country is increasingly open to the outside world, discovering and adopting practices from elsewhere, notably the West.
This openness, allied to the country’s relative affluence, is demonstrated in the consumption of olive oil, a pillar of the Mediterranean Diet.

Title
Breeding the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) for climate change

Abstract
Breeding the oil palm for climate change requires multidisciplinary and collaborative research by nature: indeed – besides genetics and structural and functional genomics – almost all disciplines related to life sciences are involved.
Research work also relies on the identification of genetic variation in the strategies of response to stress developed by the plant: this implies the exploration of resources provided by natural variation, germplasm collections, selected genitors from breeding programs together with material of interest collected from smallholders.
The phenotyping of selected plant material under biotic/abiotic stress will involve new methods for high-throughput phenotyping and genomic approaches will be followed for the identification of genes underlying the variation of traits which will be used as selection targets.
Also, improvements in understanding how climate change may influence chemical and physical processes in soils, how this may affect nutrient availability, and how the plant responds to changed availability of nutrients will also influence oil palm breeding programs.
Molecular approaches and tools have great potential to optimize patterns of plant breeding, especially for perennial species.
In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in molecular resources and methods aimed at identifying polymorphisms which control the traits of interest and exploring the mechanisms linking these polymorphisms to phenotypes.
With genomic resources becoming increasingly available for the oil palm (sequencing, resequencing and chips development) the exploration of the genetic basis of complex traits such as oil yield or resistance to disease is now possible.
Consequently the availability and sharing of such a large amount of data is currently reshaping most of oil palm breeding strategies.

Title
Impact of climate and diseases on pea yields: what perspectives with climate change?

Abstract
For farmers, pea crop is characterized by a large yield variability between years, between areas, and even between fields in a same small area in a given year.
In dry year, spring pea crops are mostly affected by water stress and high temperature but significant yield losses can also be caused by a root disease, Aphanomyces euteiches, particularly during wet years.
Winter pea can escape partially from drought, high temperature, and root disease during the reproductive phase of the crop cycle. However, when winters are mild, without progressive negative temperatures, which provide frost acclimation, available cultivars are not resistant enough to frost and are susceptible to aerial diseases such as ascochyta blight and bacterial blight.
A better adaptation of sowing dates, an improvement of lodging resistance and a limitation of the sowing density can limit the development of ascochyta blight for winter pea crops.
For spring pea, an increased use of Aphanomyces soil test could avoid to sow the crop in infested fields.
Current spring pea varieties are the result of changes in plant architecture including the reduction of 1000-seed weight that have led to yield losses by increasing the fragility of variety facing these stresses.
The development of a pea crop model, simulating the effect of various stress encountered on winter and spring pea crops, can help to better define the regions adapted for the production of these two types of cultivars, and also help the breeders to better define and choose which trait to improve in order to increase the pea productivity and yield stability.
National and European projects are in course to breed new varieties more adapted to different stresses.

Title
Review of the cotton market in Pakistan and its future prospects

Abstract
Pakistan is the world’s 4th largest producer of cotton.
Cultivation along the Indus River extends across nearly 3 million hectares and serves as the backbone of the economy.
Despite this importance, information on the cotton sector in Pakistan, in particular with regard to cotton oils, is scanty and not available from a single source.
This review seeks to remedy that gap.
Though cultivated mainly for fiber, its kernel seed oil is also used as an edible vegetable oil and accounts for a large share of the local oil industry; per capita consumption of edible oils is nearly 14 kg, which is much higher than consumption in countries at similar levels of economic development.
Pakistan fulfills 17.7% of its demand for edible oils through cottonseed oil.
Total demand for this purpose in 2029–30 is estimated at 5.36 million tons of which local production will be 1.98 million tons.
Genetically modified (Bt) cotton was introduced in Pakistan in 2010 to control three deleterious lepidopterous insects; it now accounts for more than 85% of the cotton cultivated.
There is good scope for organic cotton production in Pakistan, especially in non-traditional cotton growing areas where there is less insect pressure.
High temperature and water scarcity associated with climate change are a major concern, since current cultivation takes place in areas that already experience extremely high temperatures.

Title
Les esters méthyliques d’acides gras comme possible thérapie contre l’ischémie cérébrale

Abstract
Saturated fatty acids have been traditionally thought to be detrimental in circulation.
However, we describe the beneficial effects of palmitic and stearic acid methyl esters as it relates to neuroprotection and cerebral vasodilatory properties in global and focal cerebral ischemia.
The methyl esterification of fatty acids is not prominent in nature.
However, it seems to have biological activity related to neuroprotection/vasodilation.
We will discuss the etiology of cerebral ischemia such as stroke and cardiac arrest in terms of current and future treatment modalitiesas it relates to fatty acid-based therapies.
This review is based on the meeting presentation at the “The Journées Chevreul, Lipids & Brain III 2015” in Paris on 16–18 March, 2015.

Title
Intestinal microbiota and obesity: the impact of bioactive lipids from the endocannabinoid system

Abstract
A number of studies have drawn attention to the contribution of intestinal microbiota in the development of metabolic disorders.
Among the mechanisms potentially involved in the interaction between host and bacteria are the endocannabinoid system (eCB) and bioactive lipids.
Our work suggests the existence of a two-way interaction between host and bacteria: fatty tissue might affect the barrier function of the intestine; gut bacteria might affect the metabolism of adipose tissue.

Title
Selective comparison of gelling agents as neural cell culture matrices for long-term microelectrode array electrophysiology

Abstract
In contrast, tissue-embedded cells experience a three-dimensional context to interact with.
We assessed a selection of natural gelling agents of non-animal origin (ι- and κ-carrageenan, gellan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, sodium alginate, tragacanth and xanthan gum) in serum-free medium at 1–4% (w/v) concentration for their suitability as a more natural 3D culture environment for brain-derived cells.
Their biophysical properties (viscosity, texture, transparency, gelling propensity) resemble those of the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Gels provide the neurons with a 3D scaffold to interact with and allow for an increase of the overall cell density compared to classical monolayer 2D culture.
They not only protect neurons in cell culture from shear forces and medium evaporation, but stabilize the microenvironment around them for efficient glial proliferation, tissue-analog neural differentiation and neural communication.
We report on their properties (viscosity, transparency), their ease of handling in a cell culture context and their possible use modalities (cell embedment, as a cell cover or as a cell culture substrate).
Among the selected gels, guar gum and locust bean gum with intercalated laminin allowed for cortical cell embedment.
Neurons plated on and migrating into gellan gum survived and differentiated even without the addition of laminin.
Sodium alginate with laminin was a suitable cell cover.
Finally, we exemplarily demonstrate how guar gum supported the functional survival of a cortical culture over a period of 79 days in a proof-of-concept long-term microelectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology study.

Title
Canola/rapeseed protein-functionality and nutrition

Abstract
Protein rich meal is a valuable co-product of canola/rapeseed oil extraction.
Seed storage proteins that include cruciferin (11S) and napin (2S) dominate the protein complement of canola while oleosins, lipid transfer proteins and other minor proteins of non-storage nature are also found.
Although oil-free canola meal contains 36–40% protein on a dry weight basis, non-protein components including fibre, polymeric phenolics, phytates and sinapine, etc. of the seed coat and cellular components make protein less suitable for food use.
Separation of canola protein from non-protein components is a technical challenge but necessary to obtain full nutritional and functional potential of protein.
The storage proteins of canola can satisfy many nutritional and functional requirements for food applications.
Protein macromolecules of canola also provide functionalities required in applications beyond edible uses; there exists substantial potential as a source of plant protein and a renewable biopolymer.
Available information at present is mostly based on the protein products that can be obtained as mixtures of storage protein types and other chemical constituents of the seed; therefore, full potential of canola storage proteins is yet to be revealed.

Title
Descriptive and functional anatomy of the temporomandibular joint

Abstract
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex joint, with the mismatched articular surfaces adapting to one another via the tendon of the lateral pterygoid muscle which slides between them during all jaw movements.
There are no anatomical or clinical correlations between the significance of a joint condition and the severity of symptoms experienced by the patient.
The descriptive anatomy of the TMJ is well-known despite some variability, but its dynamic aspects are less so due to the lack of an imaging system adapted to three-dimensional follow-up of an individual in real time.
A multidisciplinary approach to TMJ dysfunctions has prompted a more in-depth knowledge on the functional anatomy of this joint to be developed.
Motor and sensory innervation is derived from the mandibular nerve, which may lead to a vicious circle between spasms and pain.
A causal relationship with otological symptoms present in some cases of TMJ dysfunctions cannot be considered as standard.

Stained dyschromia of the anterior sector: etiopathogenesis and treatment

Abstract
The demand for facial esthetics from our patients is constantly growing and recurring in the consultation setting, particularly with teenagers and young adults.
Among these motives for consultation, we find the presence of dyschromia on the anterior maxillary area of the teeth.
In the modern dentist setting, the practitioner needs to offer solutions which take account of: the patient satisfaction, in eliminating theses defaults ; of the tissue economy, with the least damaging results, leaving idealy the possibility for another and feasible re-operation.
The aim of this paper is to update on yellow, orange or brown enamel discolorations.
The practitioner has to know the etiopathogenesis to imply the most adapted therapeutic, to reach his objectives and satisfy the patient.

Title
The therapeutical challenge in maxillar area: about a case report

Abstract
When managing an anterior teeth mess, aesthetics is one of the basic parameters to work on.
It depends on the extent of teeth loss, the value of the alveolar ridge of the maxilla and the quality of anterior guidance.
However, the seek of dento-labial aesthetic has a human dimension which is beyond the scope of surgical techniques.
The practitioner therefore has a dual challenge: – creating the illusion on artificial teeth by copying on nature, while respecting the different biological parameters (the previous guide, periodontal health...); – responding to the immediate request of the patient who obeys the socio-cultural canon of young, small, and on-a-line lighter teeth.
To face this challenge, a rational timeline for carrying out the treatment plan should be taken into consideration in order to facilitate therapeutic steps and reduce the delay.
In this work, we will present, through a clinical case, the different steps (periodontal and prosthetic) of anterior prosthetic rehabilitation.

Title
The quarrel of the barbers, the surgeons and the physicians (XIIIth-XVIIIth centuries)

Abstract
In Middle-aged Europe, everything that regards the act of the hand upon the body comes under surgery.
At this time, physicians are also clerks, to whom the Church forbiddens to spill blood in 1163.
Surgery goes then to the barbers, a part of which creates a fraternity of surgeons : la Confrérie de Saint-Côme.
The others prefer to keep their Title of barbers, while still operating surgery.
The following centuries are characterized by the fights for power between the Faculty of medicine, with theoretical knowledge, and the surgeons, with practical knowledge.
They’ll sucessively use the barbers to reach their ends, meanwhile a last category of « healers » is still acting in the country : the charlatans.
We’ll develop these quarrels and the statuses delivered by the kings along the centuries in order to regulate these professions, allowing surgery to expand rapidly during the XVIIIth century, before the French Revolution erase all the previous gains and benefits of knowledge.

Treatments of the mutilated of the Great War

Abstract
The World War I, due to the strong development of the artillery, caused a considerable number of new injuries: the maxillofacial lesions.
These large dilapidations are gaping wounds which look so awful that many soldiers are left for dead on the battlefield.
The maxillofacial injuries are characterized by significant loss of substance affecting jaws and soft tissues of the face.
The facial reconstruction of these disabled ex-servicemen, the “gueules cassées”, requires the invention of new surgical techniques and design of innovative prostheses.
Health personnel such as maxillofacial surgeons and dentists have shown unprecedented inventiveness, thus contributing to the development of their specialties.

Title
Anatomical bases of the dysfunction of the temporo-mandibular joint

Abstract
The temporomandibular joint is a particular joint in a functional and clinical point of view.
Considering its articular surfaces, it is a non stable bicondylar joint.
Its stability is improved by the presence of an articular disc which divides the joint in two compartments, supra and infra discal.
Its ligaments, located on the medial aspect of the joint, improved its stability.
The motor muscles of the joint are all innervated by the mandibular nerve.
The sensitive innervation is also mediated by the mandibular. This is the reason why in case of dysfunction of the joint, the pain improves the muscular spasm of the masticator muscles which improves the pain.

Title
Esthetic enhancement of the gingival contours during immediate single-tooth implants: the contribution of provisional crowns

Abstract
The techniques for immediate single-tooth implant following tooth extraction are now well-defined.
The actual challenge is to obtain successful aesthetic outcomes and not only high survival of implants.
Osseous resorption, especially buccal, and soft tissue recession are the main issues we are being faced with.
As the immediate single-tooth implant in fresh extraction socket can’t make up for tissue loss, several approaches have been put forward.
The aim of this article is to show the aesthetic and biological interest of immediate provisional restauration in the extraction-implantation one-step technique.
The provisional restauration allows to guide periimplant soft tissue response.
Resorting to this provisional restauration requires specific know-how and rules.
With single tooth-implant, in order to avoid early micro-movements that could jeopardize initial implant stability and future implant osseointegration, we prefer immediate nonfunctional loading to immediate functional loading.

Traumatic avulsions of permanent teeth

Abstract
Traumatic dental avulsion is an emergency.
In permanent dentures, it more often requires replantation.
Today’s conditions enabling successful replantation treatment are well known, and include mainly preservation and extra-alveolar time of the avulsed tooth and replantation and splint techniques.
The aim of this article is to review the current literature data concerning the treatment of avulsed permanent teeth, the management of complications associated with this trauma, and the means to prevent or limit sequelae.

Title
Biotherapy and dental care

Abstract
Biotherapies is the use of a molecule, cells, even tissue for therapeutic means.
Currently, one of the other major bio-therapeutic tools are monoclonal antibodies and their by-products.
They came into being notably thanks to remarkable molecular engineering, a cornerstone for therapeutic tools in a wide range of clinical domains such as oncology, hematology and gastroenterology.
As with the anti-TNFα and the anti-IL-1 biotherapies are specific immunotherapies which have the particularly interesting applications for inflammatory rheumatism and auto-immune diseases.
Their production and use on a large scale have been made possible thanks to enormous progress in the biotechnology industry.
However, carrying out surgery during anti-TNFα treatment can, theoretically, result in a higher risk of infections in pre or post-surgery.
The prospects for biotherapies are huge.
Not only are the correct indications to be defined along with the most pertinent therapeutic strategy to follow but also the tolerance of long to very long use of these new molecules.
Their use is becoming more and more frequent and it is necessary to know what precautions to take for one’s patients during odontological care.

History of dental art in the times of Peter the First (1672-1725) in Russia

Abstract
In Russia, at the end of the XVIIth and at the beginning of the XVIIIth, the dental art developed thanks to Peter the Great and his archiater, Nicolas Bidloo (1669-1735).
In 1706, Peter, in the same time, put him at the head of an hospital and of the first Medical Academy.
In the Instructio de Chirurgia in Theatro Anatomico Studiosis (1710), Bidloo wrote a chapter devoted to dental diseases and their treatments.
Thus, the dentistry art, which was founded under Peter the First, became an integrated part of medical science.

Which action has to be taken in emergency?
And how to manage the wound at best?
According to the « initial assessment of the lesions » we will propose a course of action allowing to improve the prognosis.

Title
Cannabis indica is far from being an innocuous drug of abuse

Abstract
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychotropic component of Cannabis indica.
This drug is surging down especially on adolescents from their thirteenth year.
Among the 28 European Union states, the French teenagers are the first Cannabis consumers.
Cannabis, the plant itself (leaves and female flowers) or its resin (hashish/shit) is mainly smoke associated with tobacco.
The resort to water pipe, by smoke cooling, allows to inhale in a single set 100 times more smoke than the simple cigarette puff.
The cannabis currently proposed by dealers is about 5 times richer in THC than that proposed thirty years ago.
THC is characterized by an exceptional lipophilia, which allows it to be stored in the organism lipids, especially in brain, where it persists for a few days and even up to a few weeks (up to 8), according to its consumption importance.
It develops a somatic toxicity: throat, chest and testis cancers, cardiovascular diseases; it has noxious effects on pregnancy and child who will be born.
It is also responsible of many psychic and psychiatric disorders: sedation, drunkenness ; it disturbs perceptions, balance, movement’s coordination, working memory, it is desinhibitor.
Whereas it can have acutely anxiolytic and pseudo-antidepressants effects, these effects make place in long-term to great anxiety and depressive disorders.
It has clear relationships with schizophrenia, either for its triggering, or for its aggravation, inducing antipsychotic drugs resistance.
Cannabis encourages the consumption of other drugs of abuse (tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, as well as morphine-like drugs).

Title
Complete denture: the tissue conditionner treatment, is it always a present treatment?

Abstract
The tissue conditioner treatment is a well-known clinical approach, but unfortunately, it is not always grasped.
The indications are precise, but the contraindications are often unrespected or forgotten.
In reality, they are induced by the informed consent principle. Its unrespect could be the beginning of legal problems between the patient and the practitioner.
The right achievement of the clinical steps depends on the perfect knowledge of soit-liner material, their physical phases and their clinical functions.
Clinically, the steps are perfectly codified and, above all, the times dedicated to their uses must be in accordance with the physical characteristics of the used soft-liner materials.

Title
Contribution of supra-root attachments in management of the mandibular prognathism in complete removable denture (about a clinical case)

Abstract
In Complete edentulous rehabilitation, many are the clinical situations where the mandible circumscribes the maxillary bone with a more or less important gap.
In these cases of mandibular prognathism, the prosthetic treatment becomes complex, and the prosthodontist must face on the one hand the obligation of functional result conditioning prosthetic balance and on the other hand the aesthetic requirement of increasingly demanding patients.
In addition to the rigorous realization of the various traditional stages of the complete prosthesis, it is necessary to control diverse parameters particularly mounting technique.
Through a clinical case, we will put forward the difficulties of the mandibular prognathism’s prosthetic management and the interest of the retention’s complementary means in the optimization of the treatment.

Title
Sinus bone grafts for implantation purposes

Abstract
At present, there is ever-growing demand for implant-supported prostheses, which require a sufficient volume of bone and therefore, in some cases, require additional bone.
Additional bone can be provided in the form of autogenic bone or biomaterials.
There is not yet a consensus about which type of graft to use.
Therefore, after having presented the indications and the various different techniques used, we will present some cases treated and their outcomes.
This article does not set out to be exhaustive.
The surgeon, whether (s)he is a maxillo-facial surgeon or a dental surgeon, must be aware of the indications, contraindications, techniques and how to deal with complications.
As in all surgical procedures, the surgeon’s experience is an obvious asset.

Title
Psychology and implantology

Abstract
In an increasingly consumerist society and faced with the therapeutic and economic challenges and media exposure associated with our profession, our credibility has to be based on more than just know-how.
The reigning culture of image and communication with its emphasis on performance and competition brings another dimension into play: how-to-know, and this must be accomplished without compromising our professional ethics.
The intuitive implementation of new communication tools and concepts of oral and nonverbal expression and a proper understanding of the visual and the gestural all work towards the same goal: to more effectively explain and propose the implant option, in consideration of the demands of our patients.

Title
Study of the depth of the groove in the lingual alveolar Moroccan totally edentulous

Abstract
Lingual region is a region rich in anatomical and histological parts coming into contact with the mandibular complete denture.
The mobilization of these elements by various functional movements may cause the instability of the prosthesis if they are not properly understood in the secondary footprint.
Our study aimed to compare the depth of the furrow alveolar-lingual in each region of the arch during various movements of the tongue in a complete edentulous Moroccan population.
The study found that every part of the lingual region is influenced by several movements simultaneously.
These movements may slightly change from one patient to another hence the interest to perform all movements of the tongue by the patient during the secondary footprint.

Title
Electronic support tools for identification and management of rice weeds in Africa for better-informed agricultural change agents

Abstract
We developed an interactive electronic weed identification tool, AFROweeds, and an online network, Weedsbook, for agricultural change agents to aid communication and offer assistance to rice farmers with specific weed problems.
We collected quantitative and qualitative data to assess effectiveness and usefulness of these products with potential users.
With the online version of AFROweeds, used on an electronic tablet, average weed identification time in the field was 7 min 6 s with 44% successful identifications.
Poor mobile network coverage and slow internet were the main reasons for the relative long identification time and low success rate.
A second trial was done with the offline version, pre-installed on a tablet.
The average identification time was 6 min 34 s, with a success rate of 75%.
The online network Weedsbook, established alongside AFROweeds, was assessed by the test users as a useful additional aid, enabling agricultural change agents and agronomists to exchange information or request assistance on all aspects of weeds and weed management.
The potential improvements of both products are discussed.

Title
A method to quantify crop residue biomass left on soil surface after harvesting

Abstract
The accurate quantification of crop residue biomass left on the soil after harvesting is important, due to the agricultural and environmental issues associated with the management of soil organic matter in croplands.
This quantification is difficult in farmers’ fields due to a high variability of crop residue distribution on soil surface, because of harvesting operations.
The objective of this study was to provide, for measuring crop residue biomass in the field, an accurate, robust and generic method for a large range of crops.
This method relies on the use of sampling microplots (0.5 × 0.5 m), located along a transect and taking into account harvesting operations (harvesting direction and width) to capture this variability.
This method was tested from 2009 to 2011, in farmers’ plots after harvesting, on wheat, grain maize, spring barley, field pea, rapeseed, fababean and sunflower crops.
The comparison of results obtained with one or two transects (one perpendicular and the other diagonally across harvesting direction) shows that the accuracy of the estimates is sufficient using a single transect, allowing for a reduction of the working time.
The accuracy of this method of collection is not affected by soil management practices (shallow till versus no-till).

Title
Presence of wild and managed bees in the agricultural crops: overview of available data to reduce pesticide risk

Abstract
In France, a derogation to pesticide regulation allows spraying on blooms with insecticides or acaricides bearing the bee label (mention « Abeilles »), but only when no bees are foraging on crops.
Nevertheless, no decision rule is available for farmers to assess bees’ absence on the crop.
To fill this gap, the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a reflection about environmental and climatic factors influencing the presence of forager bees.
This review takes an inventory of data available about foraging activity according to environment or weather.
Decision rules based on such criteria appear inappropriate.
Only nocturnal sprays of pesticides on crops significantly reduce the risk of bees’ exposure to chemicals.

Title
Embedding research for innovation to meet societal needs in national research systems: experiences from Ghana

Abstract
The experiences synthesised in this article indicate how significant effects in two agricultural domains have been achieved by creating pathways for inter-dependent socio-technical and institutional changes, at a range of levels of action, governance and policy-making.
The synthesis emphasizes the importance of co-learning, experimentation, and critical reflection among a wide network of ‘champions’ of transformational change on behalf of smallholder farmers and processors.
It shows that innovation processes may involve actors along entire value chains, industry leaders at national level, or local level actors seeking to widen the space for change beyond their immediate circle of direct influence.
While the research and development initiatives of the domains are shown to have been critical in identifying the constraints and opportunities of smallholders, and also to the effects documented, this was largely because the research effort converged around empirically grounded problems and opportunities identified.
The information sought, and the solutions found useful, were determined by the members of innovation platforms that drove the processes of change.

Title
Waste recycling and social dynamics in the transition from rural to the peri-urban in Reunion Island

Abstract
In a context of rapid urbanization, the insularity of Reunion Island makes waste management complex and calls for finding recycling solutions.
Official requests for authorizing the spreading of sewage sludge on sugarcane are a source of conflict.
The concern of a stronger territorial integration of agricultural activities, as illustrated by the spreading of urban waste, now disturbs the relationship between sugarcane producers and the sugar industry.
This issue clearly differentiates the local (farmers, actors of the municipalities) and regional (agricultural production sectors, agricultural profession, administrations) institutional positions.
This process of territorial integration is not new because it is part of the much broader changes in the society, initiated with the departmentalization of the island in 1946.
In agriculture, following the land reform of the 1960s, these transformations first resulted in the emergence of a family farming directly bound to the agroindustrial sugar sector, at the expense of large landownership.
Then, from the sugar sector logic to today's territorial and environmental issues seized by farmers, this new agriculture of Reunion Island demonstrates the ability of the society to reformulate its concerns by gradually replacing obsolete frameworks.

Title
The dromedary and the oasis: from caravanserai to periurban farm

Abstract
Relations between dromedary and oasis belong to a certain ambiguity because the dromedary, animal of the nomad, marks the desert by its mobility while the oasis is, by essence, a point of attachment.
If, throughout history, the camel was entering in the city for the caravan steps (caravanserais), he remained rarely inside except to play the role of auxiliary in the oasis agriculture.
Change in production systems, increase in demand for animal proteins to supply a growing urban population, and social expectations of the nomadic pastoralists in education and health have contributed to change the relationships between the camel farms and the oasis city.
The development of periurban camel farming system both for milk and meat supply has upset the former links between nomads and sedentary people, resulting in an increasing interpenetration of the activities brought by both.
The paper relies on several examples of development in Saharan Africa (Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia), Sahel Africa (Chad, Niger), Middle East (Saudi Arabia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan).

Title
Intensification of maize cropping systems to improve food security: is there any benefit for Northern Cameroon farmers?

Abstract
The intensification of maize cultivation, mainly for rural consumption and cities supply, is an opportunity to improve food security in the Northern regions of Cameroon, and to face land constraints.
To study its feasibility, three levels of intensification have been tested in 2013 in 32 maize fields near Garoua in the Northen Region, of which 16 considered fertile by farmers, and 16 as degraded: (i) the conduct by the producer (CP), (ii) a first level of intensification (NI1) corresponding to the currently recommended agricultural specifications, and (iii) a second level of intensification (NI2), which compared to NI1 benefited of a strengthening in fertilization, improved seed treatment, better density and weeds control.
CP and NI1 have close yields in both villages: an average of 2.3 and 1.3 t.ha–1, respectively on fertile and degraded fields, proving that producers follow pretty much the broadcast technical specifications.
Yields on plots under NI2 are significantly superior to others, on average of 1 t.ha–1 at the Ngong site where rainfall is lower, and 1.5 t.ha–1 at the Gashiga site.
Curiously, the yield gain provided by NI2 is identical on fertile plots as on degraded ones, indicating that the degradation of the recent years, demonstrated by their lower production, nevertheless allows a response to increased intensification.
Despite these results, the profitability of an increased intensification at the current price of corn, especially the one at the harvest time, is not established.
A better price would allow the profitability of an increased intensification and production of corn in these areas as already partially practiced by some emerging farms, as they are named, which have more control over the marketing of their products.

Title
Financial impacts of Bt-cotton on cotton companies and producers in Burkina Faso

Abstract
Since 2008, Burkina Faso has been using Bt-cotton through engineered African varieties.
The study – covering the 2008–2013 period – is a first ex post assessment of the financial impacts for cotton companies on the one hand, and producers taken on the whole, on the other hand.
The study is original in taking into account the imperfect engineering of the varieties used.
Impacts were assessed for a real situation of Bt-cotton use compared to a reference situation with no Bt-cotton use.
Impacts were also evaluated in comparison to the scenario expected when a decision to adopt was made, for which the assumed 30% yield increase did not come about.
Impacts were evaluated by the partial budget method, considering susceptibility to three criteria in industrial, commercial and world price areas.
For farmers, the financial impact was positive, although the profitability rate of the extra cost of Bt cottonseeds was barely acceptable.
For cotton companies, impacts were modest and became negative when world price dropped from its historic high as a result of fiber production shortfalls, fiber length decreases and discount at export sales.
The commercial image of a country usually supplying quality cotton was negatively affected.
The adoption of Bt-cotton in Burkina Faso is a rare case of technological evolution implying diverging impacts to the two main types of players. Potentially, this outcome could hurt the funding mechanism of research for further technical change.

Title
Financing an efficient adaptation programme to climate change: A contingent valuation method tested in Malaysia

Abstract
This paper assesses farmers’ willingness to pay for an efficient adaptation programme to climate change for Malaysian agriculture.
We used the contingent valuation method to determine the monetary assessment of farmers’ preferences for an adaptation programme.
We distributed a structured questionnaire to farmers in Selangor, Malaysia.
Based on the survey, 74% of respondents are willing to pay for the adaptation programme with several factors such as socio-economic and motivational factors exerting greater influences over their willingness to pay.
However, a significant number of respondents are not willing to pay for the adaptation programme.
The Malaysian government, along with social institutions, banks, NGOs, and media could come up with fruitful awareness programmes to motivate financing the programme.
Financial institutions such as banks, insurances, leasing firms, etc. along with government and farmers could also donate a substantial portion for the adaptation programme as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Title
Social capital and conflict management in the irrigated scheme of Malanville in Benin

Abstract
This paper analyses the influence of social capital in conflict management within self-governing irrigation systems through the case study of Malanville irrigated scheme in Benin.
It shows that water users valorize efficiently bonding social capital when a conflict relates to operational rules.
Linking social capital contributes to destroy bonding social capital in a conflict related to collective and constitutional rules.
State agencies mediation was therefore required to resolve the conflict.
Results suggest that a synergy approach between self-governing systems and state agencies is necessary for a better conflict management.

Title
Are the cities of West and Central Africa so dependant on food imports?

Abstract
Since 2007, international food prices spikes have relaunched the discussions on food dependency of vulnerable countries and cities.
In the 1990's, many studies argued that local food production is stimulated by urbanization; this is not the case anymore and most researches focus on the issue of import dependency.
In this study, we aim at identifying the main structures of food consumption in 15 west and central African countries. Based on 36 national household consumption surveys in these countries, we show that cities are not so heavily dependent on imports as usually assumed.
First, although imported wheat and rice are dominant in starchy products consumed by city dwellers, we show that local starchy products (maize, cassava, sorghum, and to a lesser extent yam and plantain) are still heavily consumed.
Second, starchy products represent only one third of the urban food consumption, in economic value.
Animal products (another third of urban food consumption) and sauce products (vegetables, legume, oils, sugar and condiments) plus fruits and beverages (the last third) are mainly locally sourced.
Such a finding reveals that urban food market is able to lead the development of local food chains.
Given that calorie inputs are less and less important limiting factors for nutrition in the region under study, and that over-consumption of calories is often combined to micro-nutrients deficiency, we conclude that food policies must take into account all food products (instead of cereals only), and in particular those which contribute to diet diversification.

Title
Effect of leaf anatomy on the evolution of eriophyid mites of olive tree in Tunisia

Abstract
Selection of pest-resistant or -tolerant varieties is an important way for an integrated pest management.
In Tunisia, as the damages caused by eriophyid mites in olive nurseries and plantations are increasing, we aimed to study the varietal sensitivity of 12 olive tree varieties (Arbequina, Chemchali, Chemlali Ontha, Chemlali Sfax, Chemlali Zarzis, Chétoui, Koroneiki, Meski, Oueslati, Picholine, Zalmati and Zarrazi) to Aceria oleae Nalepa and Oxycenus maxwelli Keifer.
Olive oil varieties are more infested than table olive varieties.
Leaf histological study reveals that varieties having thicker cuticles (Chétoui, Picholine, Oueslati and Zarrazi) are less infested by mites.
The cuticle thickness thresholds limiting the deterioration of olive oil acidity are 3.9 μm for the lower side and 7.52 μm for the upper side.
The table variety Meski, which has a cuticle thickness below these thresholds, shows, however, a resistance, during off-flowering periods, suggesting the involvement of other kind of resistance such as, the synthesis of specific biochemical compounds.

Title
Livestock feed manufacturing from gathering pods of Piliostigma reticulatum: an opportunity for rural women in Burkina Faso

Abstract
Piliostigma reticulatum pods are increasingly exploited and marketed in Burkina Faso.
As little knowledge exists about this activity, a survey was conducted in 2009 in the northern Sudan zone with 90 persons.
Results show that gathering and processing pods is run by illiterate and poor women of 20- to 60-year-old.
An average of 20, five and 10 tons is gathered by 20–35-year-old, 36–50-year-old and 51–60-year-old women, respectively.
Its sale provides an average income of 40,000, 14,000 and 32,000 FCFA per woman, respectively (1000 FCFA = 1.5 €).
The Chi-squared test at 5% revealed that young women under 35 are most interested in sale and are concerned with trade (opportunities, value chain), while oldest indicate weaknesses in management and availability of pods (uncontrolled cutting of trees, bush fires, stray animals…).
Looking for new markets is the main solution proposed by young- and medium-aged women while older women want to fight against anarchic tree exploitation and livestock stray and graze.
The results of this study demonstrate that gathering and processing P. reticulatum pods contribute to fight against poverty among rural women, decrease the unemployment rate and provide forage for animal breeders during the dry season.
