Complete mandibular denture:stability and retention

Abstract
The retention problem is one of the most frequent patient's complaints in complete mandibular dentures.
Stability and retention of removable complete mandibular denture requires on the one hand to reproduce supporting surfaces and on the other hand to adopt the right occlusal concept.
Responding to diverse clinical situations and economical conditions, many solutions to the problem of low edentulism can be envisaged.
The neutral zone impression technique is useful when providing mandibular complete dentures. Its use can overcome some of the denture stability difficulties caused in some patients by a more powerful oral musculature, or in patients who have poor or altered neuromuscular control.
Over denture supported by natural teeth is widely used in clinical practice and should be executed whenever the clinical conditions suggest it.
The current development of implantology have proved that Implant-supported prostheses to be a great therapeutic value making easier the prosthesis integration and improving retention and patient's quality of life.

Title
Attachment Locator®: mode of clinical use, stage by stage, in complete removable prosthesis stabilized on implants

Abstract
Edentulous patients often express their wish to have stable and retentive prosthesis.
In the presence of unfavourable anatomophysiological conditions, the implant-retained complete denture is, when indication is well posed, a simple and reliable alternative rehabilitation optimizing significantly the prosthetic balance.
Currently, the practitioner has a whole arsenal of retention system (axial attachments, anchor bars…) and since 2000; the Locator® attachment complemented the large number of axial attachments as part of rehabilitation by complete denture retained by implants.
The objective of this article is to describe the characteristics and specificities of this attachment, as well as step by step sequences of clinical use by direct method.

Title
Anatomic basis of the maxillary sinus approach for implantology

Abstract
The maxillary sinus is an intra-maxillary bone cavity which often represents a difficulty to place dental implants in superior premolar and molar areas.
A surgical approach to the sinus is sometimes necessary via its anterolateral and posterolateral faces in order to elevate the sinus floor with bone or biomaterials.
The anatomic elements located near these two aspects of the sinus are the alveolo-antral artery, which constitutes an anstomosis between the infra orbital and the superior and posterior alveolar arteries, and near the posterolateral aspect of the sinus is located the corpus adiposum buccae.
Many branches of the infraorbital nerve are present in the canine fossa, which explain frequent residual pain after surgical approach of the sinus via this area.
A pre-operative CT scanner examination is necessary in order to reveal septa in the sinus floor and mucosal pathologies.

Title
Management of infection risk in implantology

Abstract
Management of infection risk is a guarantee of success for any implementation.
The practitioner must ensure compliance with all rigor principles of asepsis and ergonomics at pre, per and post operative.
These principles concern mainly the chain of sterilization for all instruments and reusable tools, preparation and organization of the operating room, preparing patients and surgical team, ergonomics and movement control in peroperation, and finally waste disposal and local maintenance.

Title
Contribution of the articulateur in dentistry

Abstract
An occlusor allows to build occlusal relationships in only one position: the maximal intercuspal, determined most of the time by the simple confrontation of the opposing cusps.
These constructions are at the origin of numerous errors during the movements of the mandible.
The very simplified use of a articulator will make possible to build prostheses taking of account these movements.

Title
Interest and indications of the CO2 laser in odontostomatology

Abstract
The laser treatments are therapies with proven themselves for over thirty years in the medical field.
There are several lasers in dentistry: - Nd Yap (1340 nm), Nd YAG (1064 nm), LED (910nm) absorbed in the soft tissues are called ”penetrating laser” - Other lasers such as CO2 laser (10600 nm) or Erbium YAG (2940 nm) with an ablative photo effect (soft tissue for CO2 - hard tissue for the Erbium Yag) are called “low penetrating laser”.
The aim of this work is to identify the indications for choosing the CO2 laser illustrated by clinical cases performed with the laser SHARPLAN (1020), from 1992 to present. These cases mainly concern the soft tissue surgery. The laser CO2 is bactericidal, It allows cutting of soft tissue without bleeding. It will present an incision soft tissue in focused mode like a real knife light.
It will present a peeling surface in defocused mode with much smaller postoperative following Indications for choosing other lasers wavelengths will be discussed and debated.
The CO2 laser despite its age still retain all its relevance in our laser armamentarium.

Title
1916: The year when military dentistry was created in France

Abstract
The end of the l9th century was a prosperous period during which French dental surgery had known significant advanced and structural techniques: the creation of the first dental schools (1880; 1884), the enactment of Paul Brouardel’s law (1892) which gave dental surgery a legal status by imposing trainship and a corresponding final examination within a medical university, the birth of forensic dentistry (1897), etc.
Therefore, it was a profession still in its infancy but legislated since 1892 and which had won its spurs that got involved in the war for the first time in 1914.
At the time, the dentists were limited to low-ranking roles (hospital porters, nurses, etc.) where they showed numerous acts of bravery and heroism without practicing their dental art.
Some newspapers started to wonder more and more why the practice of dentistry was absent from the Military Health Service and from various professional organisations while its role was obviously of utmost importance during the combats. Being under pressure, Raymond Poincaré, the then president of the French Republic, ended up ordaining the creation of the army dentist within the French Military Health Service.

Title
Clinical anatomy of trigeminal pain: synthesis and applications in odonto-stomatology

Abstract
The trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve V) possess a synergic and favored report with the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve VII) in the proprioception of cutaneous muscles of the face and neck involved in the facial expressions of emotions, in particular that of the pain, as well as in the corneal reflex.
The trigémino-vascular, trigémino-cervical and trigémino-vagal systems, highlights a big polymorphism in the transmission of the pain within the spinal nucleus of this nerve.
The trigeminal nerve is thus not only the nerve of the oro-facial pain but still the main nerve of head and neck pain.
The joint presence of nervous peripheral anastomoses with the nearby nerves, of anastomoses in the posterior part of the trigeminal ganglion (semi-lunar g anglion), of the magnocellular spinal nucleus and of the nociceptive spinal afferents of the sensory roots of cervical plexus C2 and C3 explain the existence of referred and heterotopic pains, noticed clinically in certain cases. Any inflammation, central or peripheral, spreads in tissues bordering the lesion, recruiting ceaselessly more nerve endings.
A sustainability of this situation leads to a chronic and potentially extensive pain which can continue even after treatment by activation of the spinal nucleus.
The trigeminal nerve is the main actor of the mythical “fear of the dentist“, and its conducts of “way out” type.
It can give some explanation by the fact that it is directly connected to the superior centers of the brain, in particular affectiveemotional and memory processing of the pain.
The dental and maxillofacial practices require an extensive knowledge of the descriptive and functional anatomy of this nerve to possess an essential and powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

Title
Complete denture supra root maxillary. Balance versus aesthetics?

Abstract
The interest of the conservation on tooth roots in the Removable Complete Denture is no longer to demonstrate. Besides maintaining the bone volume, which is involved in the aesthetic restoration, it plays an important role in the prosthetic retention (Supra Radicular Attachments) giving it a major indication to the mandible (reduced bearing surface).
However in some cases of Maxilla Atrophy (flat palate, thin tuberosity…), the indication of dental roots conservation makes the aesthetic result of the PACSR much more difficult to achieve, and even questionable.
The purpose of our work is to review the key success factors of supra root maxilla restorations that require prior thorough analysis in order to obtain balance optimization, insertion axis handling and aesthetic rendering.

Title
Overall prognosis of periodontal diseases: What decision criteria?

Abstract
The prognosis is a prediction of the duration, evolution and end of an illness and its likely response to treatment.
It must be determined before establishing the treatment plan.
It depends on certain patient factors and others related to the practitioner and his treatment plan.
The aim of this paper is to review the general and local factors conditioning periodontal prognosis to assist practitioners to better manage difficult clinical situations where the question of keeping or removing teeth is asked.

Title
The treatment by substitution in front of the agenesie of the superior side incisors

Abstract
Missing maxillary lateral incisors create a major esthetic problem. Therapeutic decision is frequently difficult to take.
Two treatment approaches are possible: creating adequate space to prosthetically replace the missing lateral incisors or closing the spaces and replacing the missing lateral incisors by the canines.
Through a case report, this article will approach the solution of space closure which is more pleasant than a prosthetic rehabilitation when she answers to the orthodontic finishing criteria.

Title
Allergy in the non-precious dental alloys: data of the literature and current solutions

Abstract
Non-precious dental alloys can be at the origin of sensitizations and allergies.
Nickel base alloys present higher potential of sansitization than cobalt base alloys.
Nickel hypersensitivity’s reactions would happen after a primary sensitization by a non dental contact.
It is also noticed that intra-oral presence of a known allergen could improve or induce an immunological tolerance to this allergen.
We present here the oral demonstrations of the allergical reactions, rare with difficult diagnosis but also remote demonstrations.
Some advices of odontological care of the patients are given with the current European directives.
The increasing request of more biocompatible materials led to the introduction of news stainless steels with less or without nickel content.
In european countries where NiCr alloys (nickel ≤1% weight) are yet authorized, they are less employed to the benefit of CoCr alloys.

Title
When metallic post and core restoration is inevitable

Abstract
In terms of prosthetic restoration, dentists are moving more and more towards free-metal restorations, more aesthetic with equal mechanical properties.
However, in some cases, using a metallic post and core for the coronal-radicular reconstruction remains irreplaceable.
In addition to the acquired clinical experience, this technique presents several benefits, such as mechanical properties, and ease of acheivement in the laboratory. All these reasons uphold the continuous use of the metallic post and core that frequently beneath fixed partial dentures.
When should we use this kind of restoration? What are the decision parameters leading to this choice? And what makes them updated?

Title

It is asymptomatic and doesn’t require any treatment.
Its diagnosis is mostly radiologic and is essential to avoid useless surgery.

Title
Is there any association between psoriasis and periodontitis? A bibliographic review

Abstract
Psoriasis is a frequent chronic erythemato-squamous skin disease whom etiology is unknown.
Psoriasis, as periodontitis, is characterized by high inflammatory response implicated in numerous comorbidities.
The aim of our work is to study the link between psoriasis and periodontitis using a bibliographic research conducted on Medline.
We identified 5 clinical studies (3 case-control study, 1 controlled retrospective study and 1 prospective cohort study).
4 studies find a link between psoriasis and periodontitis, with a risk up to 3-fold for having periodontitis when you have already psoriasis and one clinical case-control study did not find any association.
The variability in protocols (inclusion criteria for periodontitis and /or psoriasis) and in the statistical analysis (confounding variables are often missing) limits these results.

Title
Equine dental acquired pathologies and therapeutics

Abstract
Horse is an herbivorous animal with a simple and fragile stomach.
It has also an efficient masticatory system, which enables proper assimilation of food.
The hypsodont dentition is characterized by continuing dental growth associated with occlusal wear by the chewing movements.
Equine dental cares are increasingly practiced today through the development of equestrian sports.
Routine dental cares, achieved by veterinarians or equine dental technicians, allow maintenance of a balance of occlusal arcades which is essential for a good food assimilation.
They also prevent of the occurrence of more complex dental diseases, requiring surgical or conservative treatments. Those protocols are similar to human dentistry and require extensive knowledge possessed only by some specialised veterinarians.

Title
Diabetes and periodontal diseases

Abstract
Diabetes and periodontal diseases are two chronic diseases with a high global prevalence and with complex clinical and biological relationships.
Many epidemiological studies have shown an increased incidence and severity of periodontitis in diabetics.
Immunosuppression in diabetics explains delay healing and specificity of periodontal therapy in those patients, but effectiveness of the treatment has been demonstrated.
The pathogenic mechanisms are still far from being fully elucidated.
In recent years, the inverse relationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been the subject of many researches.
Recent systematic reviews indicate that periodontitis is responsible for increasing the incidence, control and complications of diabetes and that conventional periodontal treatment (scaling and root planning) reduces glycated haemoglobin of 0.4%.
The biological mechanisms implicated remain to be analysed however it appears that inflammation and oxidative stress are involved.

Title
Actors’ rationales and rural land markets: insights from Transylvania (Romania)

Abstract
This article explores actors’ rationales regarding their participation in rural land sales and tenancy markets in the context of Transylvania (Romania).
The analysis of land practices highlights the low dynamism of the land sales market, linked to a thin supply.
The landowners potentially most likely to sell – those who lack the means to directly use their land, or are involved in off-farm activities – very often favor leasing out their land.
This ensures them a regular source of income or product (in the case of in-kind leases), supplementing the household's often meager revenues, and maintains the land patrimony (including land property as a realizable asset in case of necessity).
Other landowners plan to sell their land but prefer to rent it out on the short run, because of an expected increase in land prices.
Facing a lack of supply on the sales market, the potential buyers of land have to lease in land.
This is particularly the case of commercial companies, and of market-oriented family farms.
This situation has led to the emergence of reverse tenancy configurations.

Title
Ecophyto, the French action plan to reduce pesticide use: a failure analyses and reasons for hoping

Abstract
Launched in France in 2008, the national “Ecophyto” plan, aiming “if possible” at a reduction of 50% of the pesticides use within 10 years, is a failure. After the first five years of its implementation, pesticide consumption has increased.
Acknowledging this failure, the French government recently announced a new version of the plan (Ecophyto 2) although some aspects of its content remain unknown.
For the authors of this paper (agronomists and sociologists), failure was predictable, given the characteristics of Ecophyto 1's implemented actions.
They show it by the analysis of two of the flagship initiatives of the plan (monitoring health plant “bulletin”, database allowing to assess in real time the risks of pests, and the “DEPHY farms”, an experimental network supposed to disseminate good practices, and the study of the indicator measuring pesticide use.
But the failure is even more due to the plan's main focus on farmers and advisors practices regardless of the broader effects of the “socio-technical lock-in” including a wide range of actors all interdependent and strongly engaged in pesticides’ logic of uses.
Ecophyto plan has nevertheless a symbolic effect, which could be determinant at mid- and long-terms: public authorities sent the signal of the upcoming end of pesticide massive use in agriculture.

Title
Diversification of the level of agricultural development in the member states of the European Union

Abstract
The paper aimed to evaluate the level of development of agriculture in 25 member states of the European Union (EU) in 2010–2013.
The analysis was carried out using the development model proposed by Hellwig, which enabled the calculation of a single synthetic aggregate measure based on the characteristics of agriculture in respective countries.
This made it possible to compare the analysed member states, thus providing the basis for allocating them to uniform groups characterised by a similar level of agricultural development.
The results indicate that the Netherlands and Denmark are the countries with the highest level of agricultural development.
The studies also show that the worst level of development in the ranking is presented primarily by the member states that acceded to the EU in 2004 and later, with agriculture in Slovakia and the Czech Republic being an exception.
The diversification of the values of synthetic measure in respective member states points to a considerable diversification of agricultural development within the EU, which is determined both by the production potential and the effectiveness of its utilisation.

Title
Prevalence of Salmonella infection of broiler-chicken farms in Morocco

Abstract
The aim of the present study was to assess the association of managerial practices and general hygiene and their impact on Salmonella infection of 25 broiler farms around Meknès (Morocco).
A questionnaire was submitted to the farmers from September 2005 to October 2007 and samples of fresh broiler dropping were taken.
Results indicate that 24% of the farms are infected by Salmonella spp.; 11 risk factors out of the 24 tested are associated with Salmonella infection of the farm.
The specific risk factors for infection of broiler farms are linked to inadequate hygienic measures.
Salmonella infection of the previous flock and of day-old chicks increases the risk of Salmonella infection.
Using antibiotics on day-old chicks and a detergent for cleaning decreases the risk of contamination.

Title
Better assessing and supporting agricultural innovation in Africa. Lessons from a cross-analysis of 13 case studies

Abstract
This paper presents insights gained from a cross-analysis of 13 agricultural innovation experiences in three African countries (Benin, Kenya and South Africa).
The participatory assessment was conducted with a common analytical framework and inspired by the agricultural innovation system (AIS) perspective and focused on understanding how innovation unfolded over time as a result of diverse triggers and drivers under the influence of a diversity of stakeholders.
Conducted by teams involving researchers, students and local stakeholders, the assessment involved semi-structured interviews, focus-group discussions and multi-stakeholder workshops.
The cases cover a wide diversity of experiences in terms of types and domains, scales, timelines, initiators of innovation and stakeholders involved.
Findings show the diversity of stakeholders engaged in innovation, and the nature of the innovation triggers and drivers.
They also show the importance of taking into account a longer-term perspective (one or several decades) to truly understand innovation processes.
Finally, they show that the influence of external interventions on innovation can be both positive and problematic. In particular, questions arise about the capacity to institutionalize innovation beyond the time frame of projects or the capacity to interact with local innovation dynamics.
The paper proposes different avenues for improving approaches to assess and support innovation.
This includes revisiting the modalities used to conceive and fund external interventions, and developing the necessary skills and capacities to implement open-ended, flexible approaches over the long-term, building as much as possible on initiatives undertaken by the local stakeholders themselves.

Title
The role of indirect farming in the generational renewal of farmers in irrigated agriculture in Tunisia

Abstract
Access to land for the young generation of farmers is hardly taken into account in the debates concerning agriculture sustainability in Southern countries.
In these countries, where the population is often very young, procedures for transfer of agricultural assets are frequently absent and generally ineffective when they exist.
We show in this article, through the study of three irrigated situations in Tunisia, that measures to transfer lands to a young generation of farmers operate informally through indirect farming.
We analyze the role of indirect farming in creating flexibility in local land use systems and discuss the sustainability of the resulting dynamics.
We finally discuss the major challenge for policy makers in Tunisia and North Africa to include informal agriculture in policy making to provide more sustainable perspectives.
Better knowledge about the role of indirect farming in providing flexibility to local land use and agrarian systems can provide ideas for a better use of land and water resources, which are contested in Tunisia and elsewhere in North Africa.

Title
Farmland acquisition by national elites in Côte d’Ivoire: first insights

Abstract
In Africa, the issue of land grabbing currently dominates debates about land management, but the role of national elites in this process is rarely empirically addressed.
This text aims at offering a first analysis of land market acquisitions by the national elite (“cadres”) in Côte d’Ivoire.
It shows that land purchase for rubber planting predominates, and that the areas concerned by the acquisitions remain relatively modest.
As in the case of transactions among villagers (mostly between natives and migrants), those involving cadres are socially embedded.
Those first results question the specificity of land transfers benefitting cadres, compared to transfers involving villagers.

Title
Innovation platforms and projects to support smallholder development - experiences from Sub-Saharan Africa

Abstract
This issue presents and analyses the work of Innovation Platforms (IPs) established by the COS-SIS (Convergence of Sciences–Strengthening Innovation Systems) programme in nine agro-enterprise domains in West Africa, drawing on Theory Guided Process Inquiry data recorded through 2011-end 2013.
Six papers synthesise individual IP experiences, complemented by a cross-case analysis of external influences on the IPs and their responses, a reflection on how well the IPs in Mali dealt with local conflicts, and an analysis of how the work of the IPs in Ghana led to changes in university curricula and in the researching practices of three leading agricultural institutes.
An analysis of thirteen case studies from Kenya, Benin, and South Africa supported by the JOLISAA (Joint learning in and about Innovation Systems in African Agriculture) programme, adds further insights.
Five general lessons are drawn, expressed as propositions that can be further tested against others’ experiences: (i) IPs can bring about significant socio-technical and institutional changes at a range of levels, and in a wide variety of agro-enterprise domains and contexts; (ii) the IPs are not isolated from nor independent of the networks of influence in which they are embedded; thus they cannot be treated as the sole causal agents of the changes accomplished; (iii) research that tracks the IPs’ work and performance provides evidence that enables the members to learn from experience and adjust activities in the light of effects; (iv) there is no blueprint for what an IP is nor a recipe for the processes by which such changes are brought about; the form, activities, and changes co-evolve with whatever is happening in the wider context; (v) field-based diagnosis of opportunity, evidence-based information-sharing and experimental exploration of pathways of change establish the legitimacy and influence of IPs.

Title
Peri-urban agriculture in Oran (Algeria): diversification and adaptation strategies

Abstract
Dynamic Mediterranean and second Algerian city, Oran has faced a diffuse urbanization process.
Its rural fringe, just at the outskirts of the city, is today an area where important changes take place in the agriculture production system.
A redefinition of peri-urban agriculture is carried out by individual initiatives that result in agricultural diversification: developing high added-value crops, vegetables, and ornamental trees.
The structured interviews carried out with the peri-urban farmers allowed identifying the factors that are causing these changes.
The profit issued from the crops is in line with the increase in the urban demand; agricultural intensification is a response to the land insecurity created by urbanization and the excessive fragmentation of properties.

Title
The first public-private partnership in irrigation in Morocco: Sustainable for all?

Abstract
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a relatively recent phenomenon in the irrigation sector; the El Guerdane project in Morocco is the first of its kind worldwide.
Implemented in 2008, it now provides water to 10,000 ha of highly lucrative citrus fruit plantations.
International development banks present this project as a success story, but results in terms of local development have been at best mixed.
While some farmers have benefited from the initiative, others have experienced increased marginalization from water, fertile land, and development.
Based on extensive field research in the El Guerdane area between 2005 and 2013, the present paper identifies three key critical issues posed by this PPP: partly negative effects on livelihoods and socioeconomic development; an unequal sharing of costs, benefits and risks between public and private partners; and uncertain environmental impact.
Based on this analysis, the authors reflect on the significance of the project for the evolution of economic and political power relations in Morocco.

Title
Offer and nutritive value of forages marketed in urban area of Bobo-Dioulasso

Abstract
Forage marketing is a significant economic activity that sustains the development of urban and suburban livestock in Africa.
But the issues that now arise include the nutritive quality of dry forage, especially marketed crop residues, the regularity of market and livestock supply depending on the seasons and the practices of harvest of green forage from the natural environments to supply the cities. From December 2007 to March 2008, we carried out a study whose objective was (i) to inventory marketed forage and their uses in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, (ii) to describe the organization of the sector and (iii) to determine the nutritive value of the forage.
Prospections in 26 production sites and of taking away of forage as well as semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 farmers located in the suburb of the city, 20 cattle sellers and 68 sellers in 15 forage permanent markets in Bobo-Dioulasso.
The analysis of the chemical composition of 17 identified forage species out of 30 was carried out.
The study revealed that the way the resources are exploited (which is in fact a gathering system) will certainly not be sustained in the medium term because some forage species are threatened and will likely disappear.
In addition, the study showed that the main forage species marketed in Bobo-Dioulasso contained quite high levels of nutrients for the domestic ruminants of the urban and suburban livestock for the period going from December 2007 to March 2008.
However, it is necessary that this sector's actors are better organized to ensure the sustainability of the supply of the city in forage and that appropriate measures are undertaken to preserve the many forage species that are at risk and to assist the different actors.

Title
Peri-urban market gardening centrifugal dynamics in Lomé (Togo) in response to land pressure

Abstract
This study, conducted in the eastern part of the city of Lomé (capital and largest city of Togo), highlights the spatial dynamics of market gardening under land pressure.
TerraMetrics satellite images from Google Earth archives for 2002, 2008 and 2014 were selected for the market gardening evolution analysis.
A field survey based on semi-structured questionnaires was conducted to identify the gardeners’ strategies.
The observation points that geographical coordinates were recorded using a GPS sensor.
Garden areas were evaluated using the QGIS software coupled with the Excel spreadsheet.
The spatial and descriptive evolution of the market gardening areas since 2002 has thus been known.
It was also possible to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of these areas and to evaluate the strategies developed by the gardeners to cope with the land shortage.
Market gardening land status is precarious; in average, surveyed gardeners lost 31 ha per year between 2002 and 2014, the total market gardening surface area falling from 530 to 160 ha.

Title
Innovating a system for producing and distributing hybrid oil palm seedlings to smallholder farmers in Benin

Abstract
This article analyses the development of a system for producing and distributing hybrid oil palm seedlings to small-scale famers.
The existing seed system had become so corrupted that the seedlings actually planted were largely of unimproved kinds.
The article describes institutional experiments carried out by two Innovation Platforms (IPs) in order to improve the oil palm seed system.
Theory Guided Process Inquiry was used to document, evaluate and analyse these interventions.
The experiments catalysed changes in inter-personal and inter-organisational power relationships that enabled further co-learning and co-construction of understanding and action among key stakeholders in the oil palm domain.
The IPs and those who became local champions of seed system innovation, also triggered change in institutional behaviours, technologies, and practices that further improved the integrity of the seed system.
Official nursery holders must now be trained, registered and licensed by local government.
These achievements were then shared and discussed with officials and higher level government leaders, drawing on IP members’ pre-existing professional and personal networks.
Improvement of the oil palm seed system was included in the government's latest 5-year development plan.

Title
Effects of refining process on sunflower oil minor components: a review

Abstract
Sunflower oil is well known because of its diversity of fatty acids profiles which allow different uses (food: dressing salads, margarines; nonfood: agrofuel, lubricants).
Besides, crude oil contains high amounts of desirable minor components (tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols, phospholipids...) that present important nutritional features with a positive impact on human health.
The different steps of the refining process have as main objective to remove contaminants and other compounds that could hamper the continuity of the process or alter oil during storage.
An indirect consequence of this treatment used to preserve food safety is that micronutriments of interest are also partially eliminated reducing the nutritional quality of the oil.
This review describes in the first part the chemical composition of sunflower oil focusing on desirable and undesirable components.
In the second part the refining process is detailed following the losses of micronutriments at each step of the process and the elimination of unwanted compounds.

Title
The impact of crushing and refining processes on micronutrient content in rapeseed, soybean and sunflower oils

Abstract
Mainly composed of triglycerides and their fatty acids, vegetable oils also contain between 1 and 5% of micronutrients such as tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols and coenzymes Q. Naturally present in rape, soya and sunflower seeds, these compounds are known for their benefits to health.
Their transfer and their preservation from seed to oil appear as essential.
However, much of these micronutrients are partially to totally destroyed during crushing and refining processes.
Seed preparation (rolling, grinding, cooking), solvent extraction and purification of oils (neutralization, bleaching and deodorization) are, indeed, all steps that have a significant influence on levels of minor components of crude and refined oils.
Work to demonstrate the efficiency of different alternative methods have then been conducted.

Title
Camelina, a Swiss knife for plant lipid biotechnology

Abstract
Camelina has emerged in the last decade as a multipurpose crop plant particularly suitable for engineering new lipids for diverse uses, including feed, biofuel and green chemistry.
The rebirth of this ancient crop was based on several intrinsic favorable characteristics: robust agronomic qualities, attractive oil profile, genetic proximity with the model plant arabidopsis, ease of genetic transformation by floral dip.
The need to increase both the production and diversity of plant oils, while improving the sustainability of agricultural systems, has been the driving forces behind the ever-increasing investment in camelina research.
Worldwide interest in engineering camelina has led to the development of a remarkable pipeline that allows the rapid production and phenotyping of new lines; it includes specific tools, such as databases, collections of natural accessions, methods of genetic transformation and lipid analysis.
Implementation of numerous metabolic pathways in camelina for the production of novel lipids has highlighted the potential as well as the versatility of this new "old" oilseed crop that is well on the way to becoming an ideal plant chassis for lipid synthetic biology.

Title
A novel therapeutic strategy for experimental stroke using docosahexaenoic acid complexed to human albumin

Abstract
Despite tremendous efforts in ischemic stroke research and significant improvements in patient care within the last decade, therapy is still insufficient.
There is a compelling, urgent need for safe and effective neuroprotective strategies to limit brain injury, facilitate brain repair, and improve functional outcome.
Recently, we reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, n-3) complexed to human albumin (DHA-Alb) is highly neuroprotective after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in young rats.
This review highlights the potency of DHA-Alb therapy in permanent MCAo and aged rats and whether protection persists with chronic survival.
We discovered that a novel therapy with DHA-Alb improved behavioral outcomes accompanied by attenuation of lesion volumes even when animals were allowed to survive three weeks after experimental stroke.
This treatment might provide the basis for future therapeutics for patients suffering from ischemic stroke.

Title
The versatility of the Moringa oleifera oil in sustainable applications

Abstract
This study had as aims the extraction, purification and characterization of moringa oil for everyday applications with backing scientific.
The average oil yield was of 23.92%, using the techniques: mechanical pressing (11.36%) and by with hexane extraction (35.48%).
The oil extracted by pressing was analysed for gas chromatography, revealing a profile of 21.5% of saturated fatty acids and 78.5% of unsaturated fatty acids, having the oleic acid as the major component.
The mixed crude oil was refined in four steps: degumming, neutralization, washing and drying.
The crude and refined oils were characterised through their acidity index (8.8; 20.5 and 0.2 mgKOH g-1), peroxide index (3.3; 5.4 meqO2 kg-1 and not detected), water content (876.6; 632.0 and 630.2 mg kg-1), turbidity (64.1; 12.6 and 2.1 NTU), specific mass (909.5; 907.2 and 907.0 kg m3), kinematic viscosity (43.6; 39.1 and 41.7 mm2 s-1), high power calorific (39.7; 40. and 39.4 MJ kg-1) and calorific value lower (36.9; 36.9; 37.1 MJ kg-1), and ash content (0.05; 0.05 and 0.007%), respectively. The results show that moringa is a viable and sustainable plant in the use of its oil as raw material for several industries, especially in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biodiesel industry.

Title
Regulations on the labeling and preservation of olive oil

Abstract
Olive oil is the oil obtained solely from the fruit of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.).
It is marketed in accordance with designations and definitions: virgin olive oils are the oils obtained from the fruit of the olive tree solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions, particularly thermal conditions, that do not lead to alterations in the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation and filtration.
Virgin olive oils fit for consumption as they are, include extra virgin olive oil and virgin olive oil.
virgin olive oil not fit for consumption as it is, is designated lampante virgin olive oil Olive oil is the oil consisting of a blend of refined olive oil and virgin olive oils fit for consumption as they are.
Olive-pomace oil is the oil obtained by treating olive pomace with solvents or other physical treatments.
Analytical methods are essentials to distinguish between those different categories of olive oils.

Title
Ground plant meal potential market, functional properties and applications

Abstract
The growing demand of bio-sourced products leads to an increasing interest for the development of new resources of raw materials.
In order to generate a higher economic value in the oleoproteaginous sector, meals, co-products of oil extraction present qualities capable of being exploited in a wide range of sectors.
These meals are mainly commercialized in feed application, but remain relatively weak used in the chemistry domain or even in food.
To enlarge these applications, the pre-treatment of the raw material by grinding and air-classification offers technological outlooks for the conception of new extraction processes of interesting components.
The present publication has the following goal: to examine the diversification of oleoproteaginous meal market, out of traditional usage in the chemistry domain; to characterize the meals chemical composition and their techno-functional properties; to evaluate the feasibility of valorizing these meals and their derivatives as substitutes or additives allowing the reduction of the level in petro-chemical product, for example, for the production of adhesive formulations for particle boards.
To achieve this, different actions have been performed: evaluation of the potential and accessible market starting from metropolitan crops; analysis of the panorama of intellectual property for the identified markets; chemical characterization of ground plant meals and their soluble and insoluble fractions; applicability of the different obtained fractions, in terms of foaming power, emulsifier and gelifier; first application tests starting from rapeseed and sunflower meals in the wood panel board domain.
The obtained results have allowed: to draw up a map of the inventive activity bound to the valorization of proteins from rapeseed, sunflower and soy meals and pea flour in various applications, highlighting the dynamism and the growing interest for industrials and academics to use oleo-proteaginous plant proteins; to explore techno-functional properties brought by these plant meals and their derivatives, in particular in the wood panel domain.

Title
Market trend in France on the presence of plant proteins in food products

Abstract
The current context is propitious to the development of plant proteins use for food: health and environmental considerations, expansion of flexitarism and to a lesser extent of vegetarianism, addition of research on plant proteins to the strategic research agenda in France...GEPV, French association for the promotion of plant protein in foods, reiterated an analysis referencing in France the plant proteins in food products.
It shows a significant and continuous increase of the use of plant proteins in each type of food sections, for many years now.
Wheat remains the first source of plant protein used, followed by soybean proteins.
Specific uses of plant proteins appear in different food categories: for instance soy and pea proteins are mainly used for meat based products, whereas wheat and fava bean are especially present in bakery wares.
New protein sources are emerging and will be also monitored by GEPV, as microalgae and mycoproteins.

Title
Climate change, a research challenge: the example of the 4‰ hypothesis

Abstract
Agriculture is probably the most climate-dependent human activity and is both victim and responsible for climate change, while it can also be a solution to the climate change crisis.
It is in developing countries, particularly in vulnerable ones, that the effects of climate change will be most violent.
Agriculture emits greenhouse gases but it is possible to reduce these emissions by agroecological practices, favoring the increase of organic matter in the soil.
It is also possible, through these practices, to increase atmospheric carbon capture by fixing carbon in the soil and thus contribute to mitigating climate change while improving soil properties, thereby simultaneously improving the adaptation of agriculture to climate change.
An increase in carbon content of all the world's soils of 4‰ per year would offset all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
The French international initiative “4‰, Soils for Food Security and Climate” aims to implement projects to show that it is possible to increase the carbon content of the soil in these proportions and to answer the research questions that this poses, in particular as regards measurement of the carbon content in the soil, relevant agronomic practices, the enabling socioeconomic context to this approach and finally the monitoring over time of the induced changes.

Title
Phospholipid, arachidonate and eicosanoid signaling in schizophrenia

Abstract
This paper reviews the potential role of arachidonic acid in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
We discuss how abnormal levels of arachidonic acid may arise, and how dysregulation of signaling molecules derived from it have the potential to disrupt not only dopamine signaling, but numerous other physiological processes associated with the illness.
Pharmacological doses of niacin stimulate the release of arachidonic acid; and arachidonic acid-derived molecules in turn dilate blood vessels in the skin.
A blunted skin flush response to niacin is reliably observed among patients with schizophrenia.
The niacin response abnormality may thus serve as a biomarker to identify a physiological subtype of schizophrenia associated with defective arachidonic acid-derived signaling.

Title
A chemical platform approach on cardanol oil: from the synthesis of building blocks to polymer synthesis

Abstract
This review proposes a platform approach for the synthesis of various building blocks from cardanol oil in one or two-steps synthesis.
Cardanol is a natural phenol issued from Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL). CNSL is a non-edible renewable resource, co-produced from cashew industry in large commercial volumes.
Cardanol is non-toxic and particularly suitable as an aromatic renewable resource for polymers and materials.
Various routes were used for the synthesis of di- and poly-functional building blocks used thereafter in polymer syntheses.
Phenolation was used to dimerize/oligomerize cardanol to propose increase functionality of cardanol. Thio-ene was used to synthesize new reactive amines.
Epoxidation and (meth)acrylation were also used to insert oxirane or (meth)acrylate groups in order to synthesize polymers and materials.

Title
From crops to products for crops: preserving the ecosystem through the use of bio-based molecules

Abstract
In a context of dwindling oil reserves and environmental pressures, the chemical industry needs to innovate by developing new processes for producing bioproducts from raw plant materials.
Unsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils constitute a highly promising renewable resource that can be used to diversify productions, decreasing reliance on petroleum.
A starting material rich in oleic acid has been obtained through the selection of high-oleic sunflower varieties and enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil they produce.
The double bonds of this unsaturated raw material have been cleaved in green oxidizing conditions involving a biphasic lipophilic-aqueous system including hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and a peroxo-tungsten complex Q3 {PO2[WO(O2)2]4} as a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) and co-oxidant.
This PTC efficiently transferred oxygen to the substrate in the lipophilic phase.
A mono-acid (pelargonic acid) and a di-acid (azelaic acid), with shorter, unusual hydrocarbon chains not present in the natural state, were synthesized and purified through an intensive process.
Pelargonic acid was then formulated as an environmentally friendly biocontrol agent for weeds.
We extended this green process of oxidative scission to other fatty acids and derivatives, to obtain other short-chain acids with diverse potential applications.
This production chain (crops, reaction and purification processes, products, applications) is based on a sustainable development strategy.

Title
The thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor, a new perspective for the biorefinery of sunflower whole plant: aqueous extraction of oil and other biopolymers, and production of biodegradable fiberboards from cake

Abstract
Biorefinery of sunflower whole plant was performed successfully using a thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor.
This led to the aqueous extraction of oil and other biopolymers like proteins, pectins and non pectic sugars.
It resulted in the overall fractionation of biomass, thus allowing a complete valorization of the input.
This biorefinery process was not only efficient but it was also environment-friendly. In addition, it contributed to the production of different end products for various industrial applications.
Firstly, the hydrophilic phase will be recycled to the process.
Secondly, the densest oil-in-water emulsion is a promising candidate for the formulation of cosmetic creams.
Thirdly, the upper hydrophobic phase will be usable for the waterproofing treatment of the surface of agromaterials by coating.
Its demixing will also lead to the production of proteins with tensioactive properties. These will serve for the food industry.
Lastly, the cake was a mixture of plasticized proteins and lignocellulosic fibers. It was thus considered as a natural composite. Its molding into cohesive fiberboards was conducted successfully using both thermopressing and compression molding processes.
The self-bonded boards with high density will be suitable for use as load bearing boards in dry conditions (floor underlayers, interior partitions, furniture, etc.).
Positioned in walls and ceilings, boards with medium and low density will contribute to the heat insulation of buildings.
In addition, the bulk cake will be also usable as a loose fill insulation material.
As proposed, this flow chart thus allows a valorization for all fractions originating from the twin-screw reactor.

Title
Rapeseed in China

Abstract
In 2015, China was the world’s second most important producer of rapeseed after Canada, with 7.59 million hectares under cultivation and a production of 14.1 million tons.
It is also a major importer of rapeseed grain, as well as the premier consumer.
Currently, its R&D remains mainly public.
Its rapeseed seed market is slightly superior to 2.7 billion RMB (362 million €) and concerns partly hybrid varieties Nevertheless, the improvement in living standards and the strong development of animal production in China has brought with it an increasing dependence on oil and protein crops, notably rapeseed but especially soybean and palm.

Title
Research on resistance to sunflower broomrape: an integrated vision

Abstract
Sunflower broomrape (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) parasitization on sunflower was first observed at the end of the 19th century and has continued since then jeopardizing sunflower cultivation in many areas of Europe and Asia.
A distinctive characteristic of the O. cumana-sunflower parasitic system is that it is mainly governed by a gene-for-gene interaction.
This determines complete resistance in the host controlled by dominant alleles at a single locus, which facilitates the management of the resistance for hybrid seed production.
But on the other hand avirulence in the parasite is also controlled by dominant alleles at a single gene.
Monogenic, dominant resistance exerts a strong selection pressure on the parasite that maximizes the probability of overcoming resistance mechanisms in a short period of time.
This has in fact resulted in a number of physiological races that periodically surpass all the available resistance sources.
The spread of populations to new areas and the subsequent hybridization between populations is another mechanism creating genetic diversity in sunflower broomrape and allegedly recombination of avirulences genes.
After more than one century of coexistence, genetic resistance to broomrape in sunflower has to be focused under an integrated approach that considers not only the characterization of resistance mechanisms in the host, but also the genetic and physiological bases of avirulence in the parasite.
From the perspective of genetic resistance in sunflower, most important is not relying only on single dominant genes, but following instead pyramiding strategies.
These should give priority to combining complementary mechanisms of resistance under both qualitative (vertical) and quantitative (horizontal) genetic control.
These aspects are discussed in the paper.

Title
Frost stress evolution and winter pea ideotype in the context of climate warming at a regional scale

Abstract
Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is an important crop in temperate regions for its high seed protein concentration that is particularly sensitive to abiotic stresses.
The abrupt temperature increase known as the “1987/1988 temperature regime shift” that occurs over Europe is questioning how winter pea will perform in the changing climate.
This study assessed the winter frost damage evolution along from 1961 to 2015 in Burgundy-Franche-Comté by using: (1) daily observed and gridded regional temperature data and (2) a validated crop winter frost stress model calibrated for pea.
This study shows a global decrease of the frost stress nevertheless resulting from a subtle balance between the decrease in its intensity and the increase of the number of events.
The frost stress evolution patterns with warming depend on both plant frost resistance level and acclimation rate and are still sensitive to winter climate fluctuations.
This study provides relevant information for breeding performant winter crop ideotypes able to moderate detrimental effects of climate change and offering new cropping opportunities in temperate regions.

Title
Hull content and chemical composition of whole seeds, hulls and germs in cultivars of rapeseed (Brassica napus)

Objective
To study of the compositional breakdown of seed components between the integument and the germ and its variability according to genetic and environmental factors.

Methods
The study used 19 rapeseed lots grown in two areas of contrasted agronomical potential harvested in 2011.
Pure fractions of hulls and germs were mechanically separated by centrifuge impacts after freezing the seeds.
Chemical composition of the whole seeds and the pure kernel and hull fractions was determined.
The results were used to calculate the seed hull content.

Results
Hull accounted for 18.2% of total seed content.
Real oil content of the hulls (8.4% dry basis) was lower than in the literature.
Hulls contained 2.9% of the oil, 11.2% of the proteins, 73% of the NDF; 80% of the ADF, 95% of the lignin and 6.0% of the glucosinolates of the whole seed.
The percentage of hulls in total seed content shows low variability, although the oil and the protein content of the fractions were significantly affected by cultivar and to a lesser extent by geographic location of the crops.

Conclusion
Completely dehulled seeds could result in a meal with 48.3% protein (dry basis) and low fiber content (10.8% NDF, 6.6% ADF, 0.5% ADL) but higher glucosinolate content (130% compared to defatted seeds).

Title
Mandibular third molar complication: iatrogenic displacement into the pterygomandibular space

Introduction
Accidental displacement of the mandibular third molar into the pterygomandibular space is a rare surgical complication, especially when there is no underlying pathology.

Observation
The case of a 19-year-old patient with no general health problems, presented a lower right third molar in the masticator space after its extraction, is reported.

Discussion
The ectopic position is more often related to the presence of a cyst, or when the lingual subperiostal dissection is too important leading to a slip of the tooth into that free space.

Conclusion
it is necessary to quickly retrieve it in order to avoid an infection or a migration deeper into the soft tissues, which would then require a more invasive surgical procedure.

Title
Difficulties of impacted lower third molar extraction: the role of the orthopantomogram

Objective
The aim of this study was to show the role of orthopantomography in the prediction of the difficulties encountered in the extraction of impacted lower third molars using the Pederson scale.

Material and Method
This was a cross-sectional descriptive study in the Oral Surgery Service of the Dentistry Department at the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar.
The study was done between October 2012 and February 2013. 62 patients were involved.

Results
The age group 15-25 was the most represented (57%).
The mean age of patients was 26 ± 9 years with extremes of 15 and 73 years.
Lower third molars with two roots accounted for 92%.
Horizontal angulation (44%) and mesial angulation (35%) were the most represented.
Half of the sample exhibited a depth of inclusion of position A (54%).
The position I represented 40% of cases.
In 33% of cases there was no contact between the roots and the mandibular canal.

Conclusion
The orthopantomogram allows grading of the difficulty level for third molar extraction, using the Pederson scale.
In our sample, extraction was difficult in 69% of the cases, moderate in 21% and easy in 33%.

Title
Oral lichen planus: natural history and malignant transformation

Abstract
Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory dermato-mucosal disease which gets all the regions of the buccal mucous membrane.
There are four phases of the evolution of the OLP: the initial phase, the phase of state, the late phase and the post-lichenien state.
In the literature there are several hypotheses on the etiopathogeny of OLP as well as on the association in the other diseases.
There are several treatments proposed.
Controversial studies create confusion about the malignant transformation of the OLP.
Given that the OLP represents a frequent disease, with whom the dentist often confronts, our work concerns a detailed review of the literature on the natural history of the OLP, the clinical and histological aspect, its etiopathogeny, its association with the other diseases, the treatment and finally its malignant transformation.

Title
Urethroplasty with buccal mucosa graft: harvesting techniquesand complications. Literature review and case report

Introduction
Urethroplasty with a buccal mucosa graft is recognized as the standard procedure for the treatment of urethral stricture.
The buccal mucosa is regarded as the gold standard to replace the urethral mucosa.
The oral mucosa has the qualities of plasticity and strong resistance to attack by urine.
It also adapts well to morphological changes in the penis.

Observation
The case reported was treated with our gold standard surgical technique, urethroplasty with oral mucosa harvested from the cheek.

Commentary
After an analysis of the technique of buccal harvesting, we discuss the morbidity of the 3 donor sites used in the oral cavity.

Conclusion
A graft with the buccal mucosa is currently considered as the gold standard surgical technique for urethroplasty.

Title
Inferior alveolar nerve decompression by mandibular sagittal osteotomy. Case study

Introduction
The compression of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) is among the potential complications that may occur during endodontic treatment of the mandibular third molars due to a leak of the endodontic paste.
It results in sensory loss in the corresponding territory of the IAN. Its treatment is not well defined.
In this context, we present an IAN surgical decompression by lateral cortical window.

Observation
A twentyfive-year-old patient was referred to us by her dentist on day three, to treat a numbness of the IAN that arose abruptly during endodontic treatment of the mandibular left third molar (38). The numbness remained, even following removal of the tooth.
X-rays showed a significant leak of the endodontic paste into the mandibular canal.
Surgical decompression of the IAN was performed with a piezotome on day seven under local anesthesia.

Discussion
Surgical decompression of the IAN should be performed by an experienced surgeon.
It must be performed quickly (neurotoxicity materials, inflammation, nerve ischemia), using a technique as atraumatic as possible to bring out the IAN with a minimum of additional damage and to preserve bone volume.

Title
Correction Notice to: Use of acellular collagen sponges to prevent post-extraction alveolar bone resorption: systematic review of the literature

Introduction
Alveolar bone healing following dental extraction is usually accompanied by a resorption of alveolar bone.
This resorption of alveolar bone may hinder the insertion of dental implants.
The aim of this literature review was to evaluate whether acellular collagen sponge (ACS) grafting could limit alveolar bone resorption and maintain alveolar bone volume after dental extraction.

Materials and Methods
The Medline and Pubmed databases were searched for the period 1986-2015.

Results
Studies comparing ACS grafting with natural healing did not show any significant differences concerning alveolar bone healing and bone volume preservation.
Experiments comparing the implantation of ACS alone versus ACS loaded with growth factors such as rh-BMP2 showed better results using rh-BMP2 for guided periodontal regeneration and post-extraction alveolar bone volume preservation.

Discussion
This systematic review of the literature shows that there is no evidence that grafting a collagen sponge inside an alveolar socket would limit alveolar bone resorption.
On the other hand, the insertion of a collagen sponge loaded with growth factors (such as rhBMP2) allows maintaining the height and width of the alveolar ridge.

Conclusion
Acellular collagen sponges must be used as a local haemostatic agent.
They have no effect to maintain alveolar bone volume after dental extraction.

Title
Diagnostic approach to a single chronic ulcer of the tongue. Case report and literature review

Introduction
Ulceration of the oral mucosa may be due to a local cause but could also be the manifestation of systemic pathologies or their treatment.
Infectious, dermatological, hematological, nutritional or malignant diseases and some medications can cause mouth ulcers, with acute or chronic evolution.
Many drugs can lead to oral ulcerations, associated or not with skin and/or other mucous lesions.

Observation
An 85-year-old female patient consulted for a single chronic ulcer of the tongue lasting for 5 weeks.
This work presents the diagnostic approach which led to the diagnosis of nicorandil-induced ulceration.

Discussion
In the presence of mucosal ulceration, the medical history and clinical examination provide diagnostic guidelines.
Additional tests allow the diagnosis of drug-induced ulceration after the exclusion of other possible etiologies.
The diagnostic approach can be difficult, especially in patients suffering from several diseases for which they are polymedicated.

Conclusion
The involvement of nicorandil in the occurrence of oral and extra-oral ulcers is not well known by practitioners, which explains the delay in diagnosis and appropriate care of patients.

Title
Maxillofacial complications in patients with pycnodysostosis: report of two cases and literature review

Introduction
Pycnodysostosis is a rare recessive autosomal bone disorder. The estimated prevalence is 1 to 1.7 per million.
The typical features of pycnodysostosis include short stature, diffuse osteosclerosis, acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges and brittle bones.
Maxillofacial features are midfacial and mandibular hypoplasia, and delayed teeth eruption.

Observations
Two clinical cases of pycnodysostosis with typical maxillofacial complications are presented.
Each patient was treated at a hospital.
The first patient suffered from maxillary and mandibular osteomyelitis, and the other had a mandibular pathological fracture.

Discussion
These observations are compared with previous cases reported in the literature.
Pycnodysostosis is a sclerosing bone disorder caused by deficiency of the cathepsin enzyme K. This causes brittle bones; pathological fractures and osteomyelitis are typical complications.

Conclusion
Patients with pycnodysostosis need special dental care in order to avoid tooth extraction and bone complications. Moreover, dental prosthetic rehabilitation is difficult due to jaw morphology.

Title
Investigation of the use of a mouthguard for decreasing the incidence and/or severity of sport-related concussions

Introduction
Concussion in sport, so-called sport-related concussion (SRC), is a complex pathophysiological process resulting in the impairment of the brain.
Its incidence is increasing due to the uncertainty surrounding SRC (diagnosis, management, etc.).

Literature review
In the 1960’s, some authors put forth the hypothesis that the use of a mouthguard could prevent the occurrence of SRC.
Since then, many studies confirming or invalidating this hypothesis have been published regularly.
An analysis of the literature allows us to understand this situation and distinguish between what is proven and what is supposed.

Conclusion
Currently, on the basis of the scientific evidence, the use of a mouthguard cannot and must not be recommended for the prevention of SRC.
The overestimation of the protective effects of a mouthguard can lead to an increase in risk behaviours in sportspeople, who feel protected while they are not. This can result in a paradoxical increase in SRC.
However, mouthguards have been shown to be effective in preventing dental and orofacial injuries. For this reason, mouthguards should continue to be recommended and used in sport activities.

Title
Dental complications of tracheal intubation: benefitof videolaryngoscopes

Background
Endotracheal intubation is defined as a catheterization of the trachea directly by tracheotomy or indirectly through the glottis with a tube that remains accessible via the mouth (orotracheal intubation) or the nose (nasotracheal intubation).
This medical act may result in dental and oral complications more or less important.

Corpus
The most widely used medical device to realize intubation is the laryngoscope with straight blade.
However, the advent of new technologies, like videolaryngoscopes (VLs), adduces an improvement in patient care.
Thus, VLs establish a significant alternative in the case of difficult intubations, even though the patient is healthy.
The aim of this paper is to mention dental and oral complications linked to intubation, the different laryngoscopes used and finally the advantages and drawbacks of VLs compared to laryngoscopes with straight blade in oral surgery.
Indeed, this surgical specialty may have to manage patients requiring operative procedures performed under general anesthesia.
A difficult intubation (for example a limitation in mouth opening) requires experience, it can result in iatrogenic consequences such as: mucosal wounds, tooth breakage, etc.

Conclusion
In this sense, the usefulness of VLs will be demonstrated on patients with difficult intubation or circumstances favoring intubation accidents (head and neck radiotherapy, bone trauma: maxillary bone and spine bases, weakened teeth, periodontal disease, temporo-mandibular joint diseases, etc.).

Title
Implant surgery in patients with systemic sclerosis(SSc): a five-year follow-up case report

Introduction
Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease characterized by an autoimmune reaction with specific autoantibodies, excessive collagen deposition, vascular hyperreactivity and obliterative microvascular phenomena. The disease prevalence varies between 6000 and 10000 patients in France.

Case report
A 54-year-old male had 3 dental implants placed in the premaxillary area for an implant-supported bridge.

Discussion
Dental implant procedures in patients with SSc are not contraindicated.
Microstomia leads the oral surgeon to prefer implant procedures in the anterior area in order to allow easy maintenance.

Title
Historical ameloblastoma of the mandible.

Introduction
Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor characterized by its local aggressiveness, reaching the mandible most often.
The diagnosis is usually made before the occurrence of a mandibular swelling.
Its treatment requires surgical excision and regular monitoring because of the risk of recurrence.
We report a case history of a giant mandibular ameloblastoma diagnosed at a late stage, complicating the management and reconstruction.

Observation
This was a 50-year-old female patient consulting for a giant mandibular ameloblastoma diagnosed late because of the advanced stage consultation, and having received a complete resection with reconstruction.

Discussion-Conclusion
A giant form of ameloblastoma is a major therapeutic problem, as they require complete resection of the mandible, engaging the functional and aesthetic prognosis.
The presentation of this giant case of ameloblastoma reminds us of the difficulties of access to care and monitoring for patients in developing countries.

Title
Oral manifestations of erythema multiforme: case reports

Introduction
Erythema multiforme (EM) is characterised by acute cutaneous and mucous bullous lesions.
Infections are the most common cause. The herpes virus is associated with 50% of cases of erythema multiforme.
There are two clinical aspects, the minor and the major forms. Erythema multiforme minor represents a localised eruption of the skin. The major form presents with cutaneous and mucous (oral and/or genital) lesions and general symptoms.

Observation
Three cases of recurrent EM are described.
The first case involves mucous EM and the other two mucocutaneous EM.

Discussion
Oral mucosal involvement consists of multiple bullous lesions and post-bullous erosions.
The skin is affected by the typical target lesions, but this sign is inconsistent.
Histology shows a detachment between the epithelium and basal lamina.
Treatment is symptomatic with analgesics and local antiseptic. Topical corticosteroids may be prescribed for recurrent cases.

Conclusion
The diagnosis of EM should be considered for recurrent oral ulcers associated with other mucous membranes.
Target lesions on the skin are characteristic of EM.

Title
Malignant non-hodgkin’s lymphoma of the oral cavity: a survey of 18 cases

Introduction
Primary malignant non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (MNHL) is a very uncommon lesion of the jaws and the oral cavity.
Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a survey of 18 cases of MNHL was performed.
The clinical presentation, histological subtype, mode of treatment and long-term prognosis were assessed.

Results
Many subtypes of MNHL were noted in this survey; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most frequent subtype.
One of the greatest difficulties for the diagnosis was the wide clinical variability of the symptoms without any pathognomonic features.
The standard treatment protocol associated chemotherapy with radiotherapy.

Discussion
Unless there is a prolonged delay in diagnosis, the prognosis is good thanks to adequate therapeutic protocols.
The main and crucial point is the earliest possible detection in patients by oral surgeons and dentists.

Title
Medical prescription in Dentistry: focus on drug interactions

Introduction
Association of several drugs can lead to hazardous or even fatal situations.

Pedagogical objectives
The aim of this paper is to focus on drug interactions with the substances used in the dental field (such as antibiotics, antifungals, analgesics and anti-inflammatories).
A synoptic table presents all the contraindicated and inadvisable interactions, according to the ANSM data (the French National Security Agency of Medicines and Health Products). Mechanisms and clinical concerns are detailed for each dangerous association.
Among these medications, macrolides and imidazoles (miconazole and metronidazole) are by far the most involved, followed by NSAIDs and tramadol.
This review is illustrated by 4 clinical cases from the French national pharmacovigilance database.
Two of the people involved in these accidents died (colchicine-clarithromycin and vitamin K antagonist-miconazole interactions).
In another case, an INR value of 27 was recorded without, however, leading to the patient’s death.

Conclusion
A good knowledge of the mechanisms of these interactions would avoid such situations.
In turn, dentists should contribute to updating the knowledge by systematically reporting any adverse effect to the pharmacovigilance centres.

Title
Isolated condyloma acuminatum of the oral cavity: a short case report

Introduction
A condyloma acuminatum is a benign tumor considered to be a sexually-transmitted infection.
The viruses responsible are 90% the human papilloma viruses types 6 and 11. They present low risk of cancer.
The aim of this short case report is to state the clinical, histological and therapeutic aspects of condyloma acuminata of orallocalization, and also to examine the pathways of non-sexual tranmission.

Observation
A thirty-year-old patient without sexual oro-genital activities consulted for whitish millimeter-length lesions localized in the hard palate and the left labial corners which had appeared a year ago.
The surgical excision of both lesions of the hard palate were performed, as well as a biopsy of the left labial commissure, completed by electrocoagulation.
The histological exam concluded the diagnosis of condyloma acuminata.
No recurrence was recorded during the ten months of post-operative follow-up.

Discussion
Oral lesions of condyloma acuminatum are very seldom and often secondary to contamination through direct sexual contact.
Meanwhile, other transmission pathways not related to direct sexual contact are described.
The diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum is clinical and confirmed by a histological exam.
Radical treatment based mainly on surgical excision or electrocoagulation is imperative because of the high ly contagious character of this lesion.

Conclusion
Condyloma acuminatum is very seldom localized in the oral cavity.
Diagnosis is mainly based on medical history and a histological exam.

Title
Ameloblastoma : diagnosis and treatment. Report of 26 cas

Abstract
Ameloblastoma is an epithelial odontogenic tumour; harmless of part its histology but clever of part its invasif power and local distorting.
This study concerned a series of 26 colligated cases in ORL and maxillofacial surgery services at Hospital of the Specialities of Rabat between January 2000 and February 2007.
The medium age of our patients was 30 years with a sex ratio of 1.
The majority of the patients saw only at the stage of tumefaction.
The most frequent location was in mandible with 23 cases (88,4%).
On therapeutic plan, 4 benefited from a conservative treatment and 22 of a radical treatment.
It noted a rate of repetition of 23% (6/26 cases) which joins the data of literature.
This subject hard provoked our interest due to its relating frequency in our country contrary to foreign data and, especially, difficulty of was taken care therapeutics seen the committing a second offence and wounding power of these tumours and also of the role of the surgeon dentist in the early detection.

Title
Van der Woude syndrome: a familial case report

Indroduction
Van der Woude syndrome is a rare hereditary disease caracterised by fistulas of the lower lip with or without associated oro-facial clefts and hypodontia.

Observation
We report a minor form of Van der Woude syndrome in a family.

Discussion
Transmission of SVW is autosomal dominant.
There is a wide variability of clinical expression.
Surgical intervention can be indicated when congenital fistulas are isolated in SVW.

Title
Rare zoster involvement of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the trigeminal nerve

Introduction
Herpes zoster or shingles is secondary to reactivation of the virus Varicella Zona (VZV) remaining latent in the nerve ganglia.
The facial involvement usually includes the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.
The elderly are more vulnerable to this disease, and especially its complications.

Clinical case
A 75-year-old patient consulted for infl ammatory and painful swelling involving the right cheek.
Because of the metameric mapping, the mucocutaneous involvement and the lack of tooth infection, the diagnosis of herpes zoster of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the trigeminal nerve was made.
The outcome was favorable under treatment.
Tooth exfoliation came two weeks after the healing.

Discussion
The simultaneous herpetic involvement of the last two branches of the trigeminal nerve has rarely been reported in the literature.
This location is accompanied by mucosal involvement and dental complications.
The classic blistering rash of shingles may be lacking in the elderly.
Early diagnosis is crucial to avoid debilitating nerve complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia.

Title
Solitary bone cysts of the mandible with atypical radiological presentation: two case reports and literature review

Introduction
The solitary bone cyst, an uncommon lesion of the jaws, belongs to the category of pseudocysts.
When it occurs in the orofacial region, the symphysis and the body of the mandible are usually affected.
The typical pattern of the solitary bone cyst is that of a homogeneous radiolucency with well-circumscribed and irregular borders, and thinning of the cortical plates.

Observations
Two cases of solitary bone cysts are reported.
The first one was a 17-year-old male patient with a well-circumscribed multilocular radiolucency in the right mandibular ramus, extending from the impacted third molar to the sigmoid notch.
The second case was that of a 16-year-old female patient with a well-circumscribed multilocular radiolucent lesion, with internal bony septa, in the right mandibular body, angle and ramus, surrounding the impacted third molar.

Discussion
Solitary bone cysts with atypical radiological presentation are rarely described in the literature and require differential diagnosis from other tumors of the jaws, some of which are locally aggressive.

Conclusion
Oral surgeons should be aware of this type of bone cyst to have the most appropriate management.

Title
Necrotizing sialometaplasia: A case report

Introduction
Necrotizing sialometaplasia is an uncommon benign condition of the minor salivary glands whose diagnosis is sometimes difficult.

Case report
This report demonstrates a case of a 29-year-old female patient with an ulcerative lesion in her palate which disappeared spontaneously after 6 months.

Discussion
The etiopathogenesis of this condition is the subject of much controversy.
This case is presented to warn practitioners about the possible diagnosis problem and confusion with a malignant lesion in terms of clinical and histological aspects, leading to errors in treatment.
Therefore, clinicians and pathologists should be aware of this lesion so as to avoid errors in diagnosis and treatment.

Title
Children noma at the maxillo-facial surgery and stomatology department of the Teaching Hospital of Treichville in Abidjan (Ivory Coast)

Aim
The authors report the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of noma in children at the teaching hospital of Treichville in Abidjan (Ivory Coast).
Patients and Methods: 23 clinical cases were collected from 2001 to 2007 and are reported in this retrospective study.

Results
78% of the children were between 1 and 5 years old.
The peak of the noma frequency was observed in 2002-2003.
75.8% of the lesions were located on the cheeks and lips.

Discussion
Noma is an infectious disease found generally in weaned children with teeth.
Inflammatory changes , unfavourable socioeconomicsocioeconomic conditions and malnutrition were contributing factors.

Title
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma: a lip localisation

Introduction
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA) is a carcinomatous epithelial tumour mainly located on the palate or lips.

Observation
We report the case of a PLGA of the upper lip.

Discussion
The low clinical specificity and histological polymorphism of PLGA make diagnosis difficult. A multidisciplinary consultation meeting of the French network of expertise on rare head and neck cancers (REFCOR and REFCORpath) allowed histological diagnosis and management.

Title
Bilateral hyperplasia of the coronoid processes (Langenbeck’s disease): a case report

Introduction
Bilateral hyperplasia of the coronoid processes (Langenbeck’s disease) is a rare entity characterized by a painless reduction of mouth opening.

Observation
A 16-year-old patient was referred with a history of restriction of mouth opening during the last three years.
The patient was diagnosed as having bilateral TMJ disorder and treated for this dysfunction without improvement.
A MRI and orthopantomogram depicted normal joints bilaterally but without condylar movement associated with mouth opening. After his referral, a 3D CT scan revealed bilateral enlargement of the coronoid processes.
Treatment involves bilateral coronoidectomy to relieve impingement on the zygoma.
A histologic exam of the resected samples confirmed the diagnosis of bone hyper- plasia.
After three weeks of physical therapy, his mouth opening was 36 mm.

Discussion
The 3D CT scan and histologic exam allow one to distinguish between two forms of hy- perplasia of the coronoid process: Langenbeck’s disease (painless bilateral elongation of the coronoid processes) and Jacob’s disease (unilateral osteochondroma).
The treatment of choice is coronoidectomy in both cases.

Conclusion
As illustrated in this case, due to its low prevalence, the diagnosis of this pathology is not straightforward.

Title
Management of dental emergencies in the Centre Hospitalier MétropoleSavoie after one year of running an on-call duty line

Introduction
The objective of this study was to analyze the on-call duty management of patients throughout 2013 and the results achieved.

Patients and methods
This retrospective study had a sample size of 942 patients. The variables used were: gender, age, reason for the visit, chronic diseases, day of visit, French department of origin, types of procedures already performed, treating dentist and redirection of patients after an initial emergency management.

Results
In the study group, 432 (45.9%) were women and 510 (54.1%) were men.
The most represented age group was 16-30 (32.6%) and the least represented age group was 46-60 (12.1%).
The reason for the visit showed that most patients were seeking an emergency visit because of an infection (39.2%), pain of an endodontic nature (27.2%) or trauma (18.7%).
The data showed that 492 patients (52.2%) did not have a treating dentist.

Discussion
The results confirmed that patients handled during on-call duty hours suffered from various oro-dental diseases.
The diagnosis was helpful to determine the disease severity and initiate a specific treatment.

Conclusion
This on-duty approach for dental emergencies provided appropriate and very satisfactory management for patients.

Title
Neurofibromatosis type I and supernumerary teeth: up-to date review and case report

Introduction
Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disease that may involve oral manifestations such as supernumerary teeth.

Case report
A 17-year-old male patient with NF1 was referred by an orthodontist for avulsion of wisdom teeth and six supernumerary teeth.
Ten teeth were removed under general anesthesia in December 2015.

Discussion
Management of supernumerary teeth is very controversial and patient care of NF1 is complex.

Conclusion
Even though the presence of supernumerary teeth in cases of NF1 is not well-known, patient care is extremely important and requires a team of specialists.

Title
Feasibility study of biofabricated graft for treating periodontal recession

Introduction
Tissue engineering is a good candidate for treating periodontal recession.
This feasibility study proposed a protocol for biofabrication of customized periodontal grafts to treat this problem.

Technics
The collagen hydrogel matrix printing was performed by a Microdrop® piezoelectric inkjet system.
Optimal conditions were determined by fabricating samples whose dimensions and morphology were suitable for clinical use.
Cell seeding of collagen matrices was done by laser-assisted bioprinting, and post-printing cell viability was assessed.
Then, the hydrogel matrix printing was carried out directly on collagen membranes to evaluate the ease of the graft handling.
The hydrogel matrices had the expected shape, the cells were viable, and the graft was easy to handle and suturable.

Comments
The matrix printing allowed one to choose the graft thickness.
Fibroblast organization was expected to improve the mechanical resistance and esthetics of periodontal grafts in vivo.

Conclusion
This preliminary feasibility study established the bases of the concept.
More studies are necessary to assess the graft remodeling both in vitro and in vivo.

Title
A teratoma of the lateral floor of the mouth

Introduction
Teratomas of the fl oor of the mouth are uncommon choristomas. Discovery of teratoma in adults is rare.

Observation
An exceptional case of a teratoma of the fl oor of the mouth in a 41-year-old patient is reported.
It was manifested by swelling of the fl oor of the mouth and could be mobilized by palpation.
Radiographic examination and a CT scan revealed a dense mineralized image included in a fat mass.
The histopathological analysis concluded it was a teratoma.

Comments
The diagnosis of teratoma should be considered for radio-opacity of the fl oor of the mouth.
An orthopantomogram, computed tomography (CT) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guide the diagnosis.
The diagnosis is histopathological.

Title
Mandibular metastasis from follicular thyroid carcinoma: a rare case after seven years

Introduction
Mandibular metastasis represents only 1% of malignant oral cavity tumors.

Case report
We report a case of a mandibular tumor without metastasis. The patient was operated on, 7 years ago, for follicular thyroid carcinoma.
Tumor resection with mandibular reconstruction was performed.
Histopathology examination revealed a metastatic follicular carcinoma of the mandible.
After a median follow-up of 17 months, no local recurrence occurred.

Conclusion
Though relatively rare, thyroid tumors metastatic to the mandible should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumors in the maxillofacial region, because early detection and treatment of these metastatic lesions may result in long-term survival.

Title

It is characterized by aggressive local infiltration, and frequent recurrence.

Clinical cases
We report clinical observations of 4 patients of different age and sex, who consulted for a mandibular tumor of benign aspect in two cases and malignant aspect in the others.

Discussion
Clinically, desmoplastic fibroma has a variable symptomatology.
Radiological signs are not specific.
Positive diagnosis is based on anatomopathology associated with immunohistochemistry« immunohistochemistry ».
The treatment is surgical.
Recurrences will depend on the quality of this treatment.

Title
Oral lymphatic malformations, case reports and reviewof the literature

Introduction
Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are congenital and non-regressive lesions.
These lesions are due to embryological vascular morphogenesis abnormality. Most of them (80 %) are detected before 2 years old, and thus they are rarely found in adults.
They are asymptomatic, so their diagnosis is often linked to functional discomfort.
There are two clinical aspects with different prognoses: macrocystic and microcystic.
Clinical aspects and symptomatology are essential for positive diagnosis and therapeutic decisions.
For most cases, simple clinical observation is advised. However, in other cases associated with aesthetic or functional discomfort, therapeutic intervention is recommended.

Clinical observation
We present four patients with different types of lymphatic malformation: one is on the intermaxillary commissure, the second is on the cheek mucosa, the third is on the lip and the fourth is on the tongue.

Discussion
For three of them, the diagnosis was established in adulthood with no past history of LMs.
Two patients were treated by laser, one with surgery and for the last one, clinical follow-up was established.

Conclusion
These four case reports are representative oral illustrations of the clinical aspects and therapeutic heterogeneity of this pathology.
