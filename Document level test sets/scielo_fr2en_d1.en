Title
Place of butcher shoping in the Algerian red meat industry

Abstract
This study aims to investigate the butcher activity what has not been comprehensively studied in Algeria.
It led us to wonder about the logic of providing the butchers slaughter activity and their mode of insertion in the beef and sheep industries.
The methodology used was based on surveys for two years with 36 butchers.
The average share of meat processed by butcher is 68.5% for cattle and 31.5% for sheep.
There are artisanal units of small or large sizes, each under a form of specialization adapted to the local market, known by suppliers.
Margins in this traditional butchers are under the influence of parameters which are periods of great use (religious holiday periods), and the level of supply in vivo.

Title
Dairy farming in the Asturias Region (Spain)

Abstract
Dairy farming represents a half of the agrarian gross margin of Asturias, and more of 10% of the milk quota of Spain.
During last thirty years it occurred a quick process of increasing size of farms, intensive rearing, specialization and geographical concentration, very marked by a bigger external dependency (feeding, borrowing, depreciations, regulations, subsidies) and by a lesser flexibility facing risks of the market (price of the milk, costs of food and supplies) and of farm transmission.
What continuity for this activity?
Disappearing, intensive rearing within societies or alternative solutions (based on quality sectors, part-time farming...)?

Title
Insecticide resistance in Anopheles sacharovi Favre in southern Turkey.

Abstract
We report the resistance to 12 insecticides of specimens of Anopheles sacharovi, both in laboratory cultures and those collected in the malarious areas of Adana, Adiyaman, Antalya, Aydin, and Mugla in southern Turkey.
Mortality was higher 24 h after exposure than immediately after exposure but was unaffected by temperature (24 °C or 29 °C) or the position of the test kit (horizontal or vertical).
In Adana, Adiyaman and Antalya, A. sacharovi was susceptible only to malathion and pirimiphos-methyl.
In Aydin it was susceptible to both these insecticides as well as to dieldrin, l-cyhalothrin, and etofenprox; and in Mugla it was susceptible to dieldrin, fenitrothion, l-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and etofenprox, as well as to malathion and pirimiphos-methyl.

Title
Through Mintzberg's glasses: a fresh look at the organization of ministries of health.

Abstract
In 1987, district health care policies were officially adopted by a majority of developing countries.
Many operational problems constraining implementation of such policies have subsequently been identified, most of which are attributable to well-known characteristics of less developed countries.
However, the policy of operational and administrative decentralization has often been critically obstructed by inappropriate organizational structures in ministries of health.
By applying Mintzberg's analytical framework to several ministries of health, we identify structural deficiencies that make systems unfit to match their policy environment and yield the expected outcomes of functional and decentralized services.
We propose a typology likely to elicit strategies for decentralizing health care administration.
Our analysis is based on the following steps: - a description of Mintzberg's concepts of organizational structure, generic components (strategic apex, technostructure, supporting structure, middle line, operational core) and functions (horizontal and vertical integration, liaison devices, vertical and horizontal decentralization) applied to health systems; - a discussion of divisionalized adhocracy as a suitable configuration for health organizations with a need for a high degree of regional autonomy, community participation, medical staff initiative, action research and operational research, and continuous evaluation; -
a discussion of the organizational features of a number of health ministry systems and a consideration of strategies for transforming configurations towards divisionalized adhocracy.

Title
Use of business planning methods to monitor global health budgets in Turkmenistan.

Abstract
After undergoing many changes, the financing of health care in countries of the former Soviet Union is now showing signs of maturing.
Soon after the political transition in these countries, the development of insurance systems and fee-for-service payment systems dominated the discussions on health reform.
At present there is increasing emphasis on case mix adjusted payments in larger hospitals and on global budgets in smaller district hospitals.
The problem is that such systems are often mistrusted for not providing sufficient financial control.
At the same time, unless further planned restructuring is introduced, payment systems cannot on their own induce the fundamental change required in the health care system.
As described in this article, in Tejen etrap (district), Turkmenistan, prospective business plans, which link planned objectives and activities with financial allocations, provide a framework for setting and monitoring budget expenditure.
Plans can be linked to the overall objectives of the restructuring system and can be used to ensure sound financial management.
The process of business planning, which calls for a major change in the way health facilities examine their activities, can be used as a vehicle to increase awareness of management issues.
It also provides a way of satisfying the requirement for a rigorous, bottom-up planning of financial resources.

Title
Homicide in children and adolescents: a case-control study in Recife, Brazil.

OBJECTIVE
The homicide rate for children and adolescents in Recife, Brazil,mostly caused by firearms, is one of the highest that has been reported.
The present case-control study was designed to identify factors that were potentially modifiable through preventive interventions.

METHODS
Cases were 255 homicide victims under 20 years of age, who had died in 1997 and been identified at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Police Department, Recife, and whose relatives were interviewed by two community health workers when they claimed the corpse.
The 255 controls were neighbours of the cases, paired by age and sex to them, and identified within one week of identification of each case, and whose relatives were interviewed by a third community health worker.

FINDINGS
The overall homicide rate in Recife for under-20-year-olds in 1997 was 49 per 100 000; among males aged 15-19 years it was 324 per 100 000.
Firearms were responsible for 97% of deaths.
After multivariate logistic regression, history of personal police records (odds ratio (OR) = 18.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.91- 182.50), use of illicit drugs (OR = 7.48; 95% CI = 1.86-30.17), tap water at home (OR = 7.30; 95% CI = 1.80- 29.59), and maternal age at birth over 26 years (OR = 3.98; 95% CI = 1.79-8.84) were identified as risk factors, while higher education (OR = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.11-0.43),
religious practice (OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.10-0.65), and presence of the father in the household (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.09-0.81) were protective factors.

CONCLUSION
Public health authorities should plan preventive interventions based on the findings of this study and should control the acquisition, possession and carrying of firearms.

Title
Home care of malaria-infected children of less than 5 years of age in a rural area of the Republic of Guinea.

OBJECTIVES
To assess the ability of mothers in a rural area of the Republic of Guinea to identify fever in their children, and to estimate the proportion of children who received antimalarial drugs.

METHODS
Children under 5 years of age in 41 villages were selected by a two-step cluster sampling technique.
During home visits we examined the children and questioned their mothers about the child's symptoms and treatment.

FINDINGS
Of 784 children examined, 23% were febrile and more than half of them also had a positive smear result for Plasmodium.
Mothers reported 63% of children with a temperature > 37.5ºC as sick.
Among all children reported as feverish by their mother, 55% had a normal temperature (<37.5ºC).
In contrast, a temperature > 37.5ºC was found in 38% of children identified as sick but afebrile by their mother and in 13% of children considered healthy.
Among febrile children, 18% were given chloroquine at home or had consulted at the health centre or a dispensary.

CONCLUSION
In areas where malaria is endemic, recognition of fever and its presumptive treatment with antimalarial drugs is an essential part of the strategy of the World Health Organization (WHO) to reduce the morbidity due to this disease.
This population study shows that mothers often failed to identify fever in their children and to consult or to provide antimalarial treatment.
Without great efforts to improve home care, it is unlikely that the morbidity and mortality due to malaria in young children will be greatly reduced.

Title
Active surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in poliomyelitis high-risk areas in southern China.

OBJECTIVE
On 29 October 2000 poliomyelitis was officially declared to have been eradicated from the Western Pacific Region.
This article describes the results of surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in China during the final phase of the eradication effort.

METHODS
We conducted hospital-based active surveillance in high-risk areas for poliomyelitis in 5 provinces of southern China (Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Jiangxi) between 1995 and 1997 to determine the adequacy of reporting and laboratory diagnosis of cases of AFP.

FINDINGS
A total of 1069 AFP cases occurring since 1993 were identified in 311 hospital visits.
Less than 50% of AFP cases occurring in 1993 and 1994 had been reported by AFP surveillance, and laboratory diagnosis had been carried out on only a small proportion of these.
However, improved cooperation between hospital sectors increased the rate of case reporting and laboratory diagnosis to 85% and 78%, respectively, in 1997.
Despite this overall improvement, these two indicators were approximately 10-20% lower in Yunnan Province.
Epidemiological analysis revealed that cases of clinical poliomyelitis accounted for as much as one-third of all AFP in 1993 and that some of these cases were clustered.
Clusters were rarely observed after 1994.
Active surveillance in the China-Myanmar border areas of Yunnan over 1995-96 detected 9 cross-border cases of clinical poliomyelitis, including 2 of wild poliomyelitis.
Import of poliomyelitis was thus considered to have occurred frequently until 1996 in this border area of Yunnan.
These data were important for the outbreak response immunization carried out in 1996 in the border prefectures of Yunnan.

CONCLUSION
Our investigation confirmed a high level of AFP surveillance in poliomyelitis high-risk areas of the five provinces and provided valuable information on the interruption of wild poliovirus circulation in southern China that will be of use to countries in other regions that have yet to eradicate poliomyelitis.

Title
Etiology of urethral discharge in West Africa: the role of Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the etiological role of pathogens other than Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral discharge in West African men.

METHODS
Urethral swabs were obtained from 659 male patients presenting with urethral discharge in 72 primary health care facilities in seven West African countries, and in 339 controls presenting for complaints unrelated to the genitourinary tract.
Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the presence of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Ureaplasma urealyticum.

FINDINGS
N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, C. trachomatis, and M. genitalium - but not U. urealyticum - were found more frequently in men with urethral discharge than in asymptomatic controls, being present in 61.9%, 13.8%, 13.4% and 10.0%, respectively, of cases of urethral discharge.
Multiple infections were common.
Among patients with gonococcal infection, T. vaginalis was as frequent a coinfection as C. trachomatis.
M. genitalium, T. vaginalis, and C. trachomatis caused a similar clinical syndrome to that associated with gonococcal infection, but with a less severe urethral discharge.

CONCLUSION
M. genitalium and T. vaginalis are important etiological agents of urethral discharge in West Africa.
The frequent occurrence of multiple infections with any combination of four pathogens strongly supports the syndromic approach.
The optimal use of metronidazole in flowcharts for the syndromic management of urethral discharge needs to be explored in therapeutic trials.

OBJECTIVE
To determine trends in the causes of death in a West African town.
Mortality caused by infectious diseases is reported to be declining while degenerative and man-made mortality factors are increasingly significant.
Most mortality analyses for sub-Saharan Africa have involved extrapolation and have not been derived from community-based data.

METHODS
Historical data on causes of death coded by physicians were analysed for the urban population of Banjul for the period 1942-97.
As the calculation of rates is not possible in the absence of a reliable population denominator, age-standardized proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) for men and women by major groups of causes of death were calculated, using the 1942-49 data for reference purposes.

FINDINGS
Most deaths were attributable to communicable diseases.
There was a shift in proportional mortality over the study period: the contribution of communicable diseases declined and that of noncommunicable diseases and injuries increased.
These trends were more marked among men than women.

CONCLUSIONS
The data illustrate that while noncommunicable diseases and injuries are emerging as important contributors to mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, communicable diseases remain significant causes of mortality and should not be neglected.

Title
Low-cost on-the-job peer training of nurses improved immunization coverage in Indonesia.

Abstract
In Indonesia responsibility for immunizations is placed on local government health centres and on the nurses who provide the immunizations at each centre.
An on-the-job peer training programme for these nurses, which was designed to improve the immunization performance of poorly performing health centres in terms of coverage and practice in Maluku province, was evaluated.
Experienced immunization nurses were sent to health centres where nurses were inexperienced or performing poorly; the experienced nurses spent 1-2 weeks providing on-the-job training for the less experienced ones.
An evaluation of the 13 centres that participated in the programme and the 95 that did not found that the programme increased both immunization coverage and the quality of practice.
Coverage of diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPT), polio, and measles vaccinations rose by about 39% in all 13 participating centres when compared with non-participating centres, and by about 54% in the 11 centres that had a functioning transportation system during the year after training.
These results reflect increases in the actual number of doses given and improvements in the accuracy of reports.
Potential threats to the study's validity were examined and found not to be significant.
The out-of-pocket cost of the training programme was about US$ 53 per trainee or about US$ 0.05 per additional vaccine reported to have been given.
The marginal cost per additional fully immunized child was estimated to be US$ 0.50.

Title
Comparison of two azithromycin distribution strategies for controlling trachoma in Nepal.

OBJECTIVE
The study compares the effectiveness of two strategies for distributing azithromycin in an area with mild-to-moderate active trachoma in Nepal.

METHODS
The two strategies investigated were the use of azithromycin for 1) mass treatment of all children, or 2) targeted treatment of only those children who were found to be clinically active, as well as all members of their household.

FINDINGS
Mass treatment of children was slightly more effective in terms of decreasing the prevalence of clinically active trachoma (estimated by clinical examination) and of chlamydial infection (estimated by DNA amplification tests), although neither result was statistically significant.

CONCLUSION
Both strategies appeared to be effective in reducing the prevalence of clinically active trachoma and infection six months after the treatment.
Antibiotic treatment reduced the prevalence of chlamydial infection more than it did the level of clinically active trachoma.

Title
Corneal blindness: a global perspective.

Abstract
Diseases affecting the cornea are a major cause of blindness worldwide, second only to cataract in overall importance.
The epidemiology of corneal blindness is complicated and encompasses a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory eye diseases that cause corneal scarring, which ultimately leads to functional blindness.
In addition, the prevalence of corneal disease varies from country to country and even from one population to another.
While cataract is responsible for nearly 20 million of the 45 million blind people in the world, the next major cause is trachoma which blinds 4.9 million individuals, mainly as a result of corneal scarring and vascularization.
Ocular trauma and corneal ulceration are significant causes of corneal blindness that are often underreported but may be responsible for 1.5-2.0 million new cases of monocular blindness every year.
Causes of childhood blindness (about 1.5 million worldwide with 5 million visually disabled) include xerophthalmia (350 000 cases annually), ophthalmia neonatorum, and less frequently seen ocular diseases such as herpes simplex virus infections and vernal keratoconjunctivitis.
Even though the control of onchocerciasis and leprosy are public health success stories, these diseases are still significant causes of blindness - affecting a quarter of a million individuals each.
Traditional eye medicines have also been implicated as a major risk factor in the current epidemic of corneal ulceration in developing countries.
Because of the difficulty of treating corneal blindness once it has occurred, public health prevention programmes are the most cost-effective means of decreasing the global burden of corneal blindness.

Title
Childhood blindness in the context of VISION 2020: the right to sight.

Abstract
The major causes of blindness in children vary widely from region to region, being largely determined by socioeconomic development, and the availability of primary health care and eye care services.
In high-income countries, lesions of the optic nerve and higher visual pathways predominate as the cause of blindness, while corneal scarring from measles, vitamin A deficiency, the use of harmful traditional eye remedies, and ophthalmia neonatorum are the major causes in low-income countries.
Retinopathy of prematurity is an important cause in middle-income countries.
Other significant causes in all countries are cataract, congenital abnormalities, and hereditary retinal dystrophies.
It is estimated that, in almost half of the children who are blind today, the underlying cause could have been prevented, or the eye condition treated to preserve vision or restore sight.
The control of blindness in children is a priority within the World Health Organization's VISION 2020 programme.
Strategies need to be region specific, based on activities to prevent blindness in the community - through measles immunization, health education, and control of vitamin A deficiency - and the provision of tertiary-level eye care facilities for conditions that require specialist management.

Title
Refractive error blindness.

Abstract
Recent data suggest that a large number of people are blind in different parts of the world due to high refractive error because they are not using appropriate refractive correction.
Refractive error as a cause of blindness has been recognized only recently with the increasing use of presenting visual acuity for defining blindness.
In addition to blindness due to naturally occurring high refractive error, inadequate refractive correction of aphakia after cataract surgery is also a significant cause of blindness in developing countries.
Blindness due to refractive error in any population suggests that eye care services in general in that population are inadequate since treatment of refractive error is perhaps the simplest and most effective form of eye care.
Strategies such as vision screening programmes need to be implemented on a large scale to detect individuals suffering from refractive error blindness.
Sufficient numbers of personnel to perform reasonable quality refraction need to be trained in developing countries.
Also adequate infrastructure has to be developed in underserved areas of the world to facilitate the logistics of providing affordable reasonable-quality spectacles to individuals suffering from refractive error blindness.
Long-term success in reducing refractive error blindness worldwide will require attention to these issues within the context of comprehensive approaches to reduce all causes of avoidable blindness.

Title
Environmental pesticide exposure in Honduras following hurricane Mitch.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether environmental contamination occurred in the wake of hurricane Mitch (30-31 October 1998), we conducted a population-based cross-sectional household survey in the barrio of Istoca, Department of Choluteca, Honduras.
The goals were to evaluate chemical contamination of potable water and the extent of human exposure to chemicals as a result of extensive flooding.

METHODS
The survey consisted of an environmental exposure assessment, which included assaying water and soil samples for contaminants, and taking blood and urine samples from 45 adolescents aged 15-18 years.
We also made a subjective questionnaire assessment of 155 households.

FINDINGS
There was significant contamination of the soil in Istoca, but no water contamination in the aftermath of hurricane Mitch.
The soil levels of chlopyrifos and parathion were 30- and 1000-times higher, respectively, than the Environmental Data Quality Level.
However, the most striking finding was the detection of elevated levels of chlorinated and organophosphate pesticides in adolescents.
Toxicological analyses of serum specimens showed that 51% of the samples had elevated levels of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p-DDE) (range, 1.16-96.9 ng/ml) (US reference mean = 3.5 ng/ml) in adults.
Dieldrin levels >0.2 ng/ml were also present in 23% of the serum specimens (serum levels of this analyte in US adolescents are <0.2 ng/ml).
Of 43 urine samples analysed for organophosphate metabolites, 18.6% contained diethyl phosphate (DEP) at levels which were greater that the reference mean of 6.45 mg/g creatinine.
We also detected elevated levels of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) and of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (3,5,6-TCPY) in 91% and 42% of the samples, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The elevated levels of chlorinated pesticides were surprising, since although these substances were banned in Honduras 15 years ago it appears that they are still being used in the country.
Moreover, elevated levels of organophosphates were detected in the study adolescents even three weeks after the hurricane.
Since these chemicals are usually cleared from the body quickly, our data suggest that the adolescents face an ongoing threat from pesticide exposure.

Title
Improving antibiotic prescribing in Hai Phong Province, Viet Nam: the "antibiotic-dose" indicator.

OBJECTIVE
To improve the use and dosage of antibiotics prescribed at Commune Health Stations in Viet Nam, and in so doing find out whether antibiotic dosage can be easily and reliably measured as a drug-use indicator.

METHODS
All commune health workers from the 217 commune health stations in Hai Phong Province, Viet Nam, were enlisted over an 18-month study period during 1994-96.
The study design was a longitudinal time series, with each new district baseline acting as a rolling control.
Each health station was monitored monthly by district supervisors.
Two formal evaluations by doctors external to the study were compared with the supervisors' results.
Basic medical equipment was provided three times over nine months, conditional on improvements in prescribing practices and adequate supervision of prescribing practices.

FINDINGS
The supervisors' data showed that the percentage of encounters in which a patient was prescribed an antibiotic decreased from over 65% to around 45%.
When antibiotics were given, the percentage of patients who received an adequate dose increased from under 30% to 98%.
These changes were stable for 17 months after the intervention stopped.

CONCLUSION
Such initiatives require the active collaboration of health personnel and civic leaders at every level.
Conditional equipment donation was shown to be effective.
A simple indicator measuring adequacy of antibiotic dose can be an effective tool to improve the use of antibiotics in a sustainable way.

Title
Attitudes towards war, killing, and punishment of children among young people in Estonia, Finland, Romania, the Russian Federation, and the USA.

OBJECTIVE
To study the cultural differences in moral disengagement, which lends support to attitudes used to justify violence.

METHODS
We carried out classroom surveys of a total of 3122 students in the USA (Houston, TX, and Washington, DC) and in four European countries - Estonia (Tartu), Finland (Helsinki), Romania (Satu Mare) and the Russian Federation (St Petersburg).
Data were also taken from a random sample telephone survey of 341 young adults (aged 18-35 years) in Texas, USA.
Ten distinct groups were studied.
Seven questions were common to all the surveys, using identical statements about the participants' agreement with attitudes relating to war, diplomacy, killing, and the punishment of children.

FINDINGS
The US students were more likely than those in Europe to agree with the following statements: War is necessary' (20% vs 9%), A person has the right to kill to defend property' (54% vs 17%), and Physical punishment is necessary for children' (27% vs 10%).
Justification of war and killing was less common among females than males in all groups; other differences within the US groups and the European groups were smaller than the differences between the US and European groups.

CONCLUSION
The results confirm the gap between the US and European groups in moral disengagement attitudes and tendencies that could lead to deadly violence.

Title
Impact of prepackaging antimalarial drugs on cost to patients and compliance with treatment.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the extent to which district health teams could reduce the burden of malaria, a continuing major cause of mortality and morbidity, in a situation where severe resource constraints existed and integrated care was provided.

METHODS
Antimalarial drugs were prepackaged into unit doses in an attempt to improve compliance with full courses of chemotherapy.

FINDINGS
Compliance improved by approximately 20% in both adults and children.
There were 50% reductions in cost to patients, waiting time at dispensaries and drug wastage at facilities.
The intervention, which tended to improve both case and drug management at facilities, was well accepted by health staff and did not involve them in additional working time.

CONCLUSION
The prepackaging of antimalarials at the district level offers the prospect of improved compliance and a reduction in the spread of resistance.

Title
Nested case-control study in a serological survey to evaluate the effectiveness of a Chagas disease control programme in Brazil.

OBJECTIVE
To identify risk factors associated with Trypanosoma cruzi infections in areas under surveillance in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.

METHODS
A model using a nested case-control design incorporated within a serological survey of schoolchildren which was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Chagas disease control programme.

FINDINGS
In a sample of 40 374 schoolchildren (aged 7-14 years) surveyed, 16 children tested positive for T. cruzi antibody (by indirect immunofluorescence and indirect haemagglutination).
In the case-control study, each case was randomly matched to three seronegative controls (classroom and age + 1 year).
Compared to controls, T. cruzi-seropositive children were more likely to have a seropositive mother (odds ratio (OR) = 6.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-63.9) or a seropositive family member (OR = 8.6; 95% CI = 1.0-75.5).

CONCLUSION
Use of the nested case-control model in a sero-epidemiological survey to evaluate risk factors for T. cruzi transmission was adequate for assessing the effectiveness of a Chagas disease control programme.

Title
Critical control points of complementary food preparation and handling in eastern Nigeria.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate microbial contamination and critical control points (CCPs) in the preparation and handling of complementary foods in 120 households in Imo state, Nigeria.

METHODS
The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach was used to investigate processes and procedures that contributed to microbial contamination, growth and survival, and to identify points where controls could be applied to prevent or eliminate these microbiological hazards or reduce them to acceptable levels.
Food samples were collected and tested microbiologically at different stages of preparation and handling.

FINDINGS
During cooking, all foods attained temperatures capable of destroying vegetative forms of food-borne pathogens.
However, the risk of contamination increased by storage of food at ambient temperature, by using insufficiently high temperatures to reheat the food, and by adding contaminated ingredients such as dried ground crayfish and soybean powder at stages where no further heat treatment was applied.
The purchasing of contaminated raw foodstuffs and ingredients, particularly raw akamu, from vendors in open markets is also a CCP.

CONCLUSION
Although an unsafe environment poses many hazards for children's food, the hygienic quality of prepared food can be assured if basic food safety principles are observed.
When many factors contribute to food contamination, identification of CCPs becomes particularly important and can facilitate appropriate targeting of resources and prevention efforts.

Title
Focusing strategies of condom use against HIV in different behavioural settings: an evaluation based on a simulation model.

Abstract
Using a sexually transmitted diseases simulation model (STDSIM), we made projections of HIV spread for four profiles of sexual behaviour reflecting patterns encountered across the developing world: 1) much commercial sex, no short relationships; 2) commercial sex, concurrent short relationships; 3) concurrent relationships, no commercial sex; 4) serial short relationships, some commercial sex.
We studied the effects of increasing condom use in three target groups: commercial sex workers (CSWs); men engaging in commercial contacts and short relationships; and females in steady relationships.
The projections indicated that the CSW and male strategies were more effective in reducing HIV incidence than the strategy focusing on females in steady relationships.
In the long run, even the group of men and women with one recent partner were better protected against HIV infection by condom use in high-risk contacts than by condom use in steady relationships.
Furthermore, the numbers of HIV cases prevented per condom used were 7 to 500 times higher for condoms used by CSWs or men engaging in short relationships and commercial sex than for ones used by females in steady relationships.
The results indicated the merit of focusing on high-risk groups irrespective of the pattern of sexual behaviour, even in epidemics that had already spread throughout populations.

Title
Impact of the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement on the pharmaceutical industry in Thailand.

Abstract
The 1994 World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) established minimum universal standards in all areas of intellectual property.
It is intended to implement these standards globally through a WTO enforcement mechanism.
The present article proposes a strategy for alleviating the potentially negative impact of TRIPS in Thailand in relation to the following: purchasers; prescribers and dispensers; producers; products; price control; patent-to-third-party; parallel imports; power of the customer; patentable new drugs; personnel; and prevention policies.
The following TRIPS provisions are pertinent to the pharmaceutical industry in Thailand: the limited term of product and process patents; the conditions of protection; and the broad scope for compulsory licensing and enforcement procedures in the national patent system.

Title
Client satisfaction and quality of health care in rural Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE
To assess user expectations and degree of client satisfaction and quality of health care provided in rural Bangladesh.

METHODS
A total of 1913 persons chosen by systematic random sampling were successfully interviewed immediately after having received care in government health facilities.

FINDINGS
The most powerful predictor for client satisfaction with the government services was provider behaviour, especially respect and politeness.
For patients this aspect was much more important than the technical competence of the provider.
Furthermore, a reduction in waiting time (on average to 30 min) was more important to clients than a prolongation of the quite short (from a medical standpoint) consultation time (on average 2 min, 22 sec), with 75% of clients being satisfied.
Waiting time, which was about double at outreach services than that at fixed services, was the only element with which users of outreach services were dissatisfied.

CONCLUSIONS
This study underscores that client satisfaction is determined by the cultural background of the people.
It shows the dilemma that, though optimally care should be capable of meeting both medical and psychosocial needs, in reality care that meets all medical needs may fail to meet the client's emotional or social needs.
Conversely, care that meets psychosocial needs may leave the clients medically at risk.
It seems important that developing countries promoting client-oriented health services should carry out more in-depth research on the determinants of client satisfaction in the respective culture.

Title
Targeted interventions required against genital ulcers in African countries worst affected by HIV infection.

Abstract
It remains unclear why there is such marked variation in the severity of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic between African countries.
The prevalence of HIV infection has reached high levels in many parts of southern Africa but in most countries of West Africa the levels are much lower.
Although there is good evidence that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and genital ulcers in particular facilitate heterosexual transmission of HIV, there is little comparative STI data from the African countries worst affected by HIV infection.
A MEDLINE search covering the period 1966 to August 2000 using the keywords sexually transmitted diseases', genital ulcers' and Africa' was performed to identify factors that might be relevant to the spread of HIV infection in countries with the highest prevalences of the virus.
In the countries worst affected by HIV infection, the proportions of men and women with STI who had genital ulcers lay in the ranges 45-68% and 13-68%, respectively.
The proportions were much lower in countries of West Africa than in those of southern Africa.
The African countries worst affected by HIV infection should adopt a more specialized approach to STI control than hitherto and specifically target the high incidence of genital ulceration.
Locally, technical STI committees should draw up country-specific guidelines taking into account the prevalence of the various causes of genital ulceration.
In these countries, national AIDS control programmes and donor agencies should develop a specific focus for decreasing the incidence of genital ulcer disease.

Title
Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa using seroprevalence data from antenatal clinics.

OBJECTIVE
To improve the methodological basis for modelling the HIV/AIDS epidemics in adults in sub-Saharan Africa, with examples from Botswana, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe.
Understanding the magnitude and trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is essential for planning and evaluating control strategies.

METHODS
Previous mathematical models were developed to estimate epidemic trends based on sentinel surveillance data from pregnant women.
In this project, we have extended these models in order to take full advantage of the available data.
We developed a maximum likelihood approach for the estimation of model parameters and used numerical simulation methods to compute uncertainty intervals around the estimates.

FINDINGS
In the four countries analysed, there were an estimated half a million new adult HIV infections in 1999 (range: 260 to 960 thousand), 4.7 million prevalent infections (range: 3.0 to 6.6 million), and 370 thousand adult deaths from AIDS (range: 266 to 492 thousand).

CONCLUSION
While this project addresses some of the limitations of previous modelling efforts, an important research agenda remains, including the need to clarify the relationship between sentinel data from pregnant women and the epidemiology of HIV and AIDS in the general population.

Title
Predicting and comparing long-term measles antibody profiles of different immunization policies.

OBJECTIVE
Measles outbreaks are infrequent and localized in areas with high coverage of measles vaccine.
The need is to assess long-term effectiveness of coverage.
Since 1991, no measles epidemic affecting the whole island has occurred in Taiwan, China.
Epidemiological models are developed to predict the long-term measles antibody profiles and compare the merits of different immunization policies on the island.

METHODS
The current measles immunization policy in Taiwan, China, is 1 dose of measles vaccine at 9 months of age and 1 dose of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at 15 months of age, plus a mop-up' of MMR-unvaccinated schoolchildren at 6 years of age.
Refinements involve a change to a two-dose strategy.
Five scenarios based on different vaccination strategies are compared.
The models are analysed using Microsoft Excel.

FINDINGS
First, making the assumption that measles vaccine-induced immunity will not wane, the predicted measles IgG seroprevalences in preschool children range from 81% (lower bound) to 94% (upper bound) and in schoolchildren reach 97-98% in all strategy scenarios.
Results are dependent on the association of vaccine coverage between the first and second dose of vaccine.
Second, if it is assumed that vaccine-induced antibody titres decay, the long-term measles seroprevalence will depend on the initial titres post vaccination, decay rates of antibody titres and cut-off of seropositivity.

CONCLUSION
If MMR coverage at 12 months of age can reach >90%, it would be worth changing the current policy to 2 doses at 12 months and 6 years of age to induce higher antibody titres.
These epidemiological models could be applied wherever a similar stage of measles elimination has been reached.

Title
Efficacy of oral azithromycin versus topical tetracycline in mass treatment of endemic trachoma.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the impact of mass treatment with oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline on the prevalence of active trachoma.

METHODS
A total of 1803 inhabitants from 106 households of eight Gambian villages were randomized, in pairs, to receive either three doses of azithromycin at weekly intervals, or daily topical tetracycline over 6 weeks.
Ocular examinations were conducted before treatment, and 2, 6 and 12 months after treatment.

FINDINGS
Prior to treatment, 16% of the study participants had active trachoma.
Two months after treatment, the prevalence of trachoma was 4.6% and 5.1% in the azithromycin and the tetracycline groups, respectively (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53, 2.02).
Subsequently, the prevalence rose to 16% in the tetracycline group, while remaining at 7.7% in the azithromycin group (adjusted OR at 12 months = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.80).
At 12 months post-treatment, there were fewer new prevalent cases in the azithromycin group, and trachoma resolution was significantly better for this group (adjusted OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.42, 3.50).

CONCLUSION
Oral azithromycin therefore appears to offer a means for controlling blinding trachoma.
It is easy to administer and higher coverages may be possible than have been achieved hitherto.

Title
Three case definitions of malaria and their effect on diagnosis, treatment and surveillance in Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh.

Abstract
In countries where malaria is endemic, routine blood slide examinations remain the major source of data for the public health surveillance system.
This approach has become inadequate, however, as the public health emphasis has changed from surveillance of laboratory-confirmed malaria infections to the early detection and treatment of the disease.
As a result, it has been advocated that the information collected about malaria be changed radically and should include the monitoring of morbidity and mortality, clinical practice and quality of care.
To improve the early diagnosis and prompt treatment (EDPT) of malaria patients, three malaria case definitions (MCDs) were developed, with treatment and reporting guidelines, and used in all static health facilities of Cox's Bazar district, Bangladesh (population 1.5 million).
The three MCDs were: uncomplicated malaria (UM); treatment failure malaria (TFM); and severe malaria (SM).
The number of malaria deaths was also reported.
This paper reviews the rationale and need for MCDs in malaria control programmes and presents an analysis of the integrated surveillance information collected during the three-year period, 1995-97.
The combined analysis of slide-based and clinical data and their related indicators shows that blood slide analysis is no longer used to document fever episodes but to support EDPT, with priority given to SM and TFM patients.
Data indicate a decrease in the overall positive predictive value of the three MCDs as malaria prevalence decreases.
Hence the data quantify the extent to which the mainly clinical diagnosis of UM leads to over-diagnosis and over-treatment in changing epidemiological conditions.
Also the new surveillance data show: a halving in the case fatality rate among SM cases (from 6% to 3.1%) attributable to improved quality of care, and a stable proportion of TFM cases (around 7%) against a defined population denominator.
Changes implemented in the EDPT of malaria patients and in the surveillance system were based on existing staff capacity and routine reporting structures.

Title
Evaluation of efficacy of school-based anthelmintic treatments against anaemia in children in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the impact of deworming on anaemia as part of a large-scale school-based anthelmintic treatment programme in the Tanga Region of the United Republic of Tanzania.

METHODS
Both the reduction in the prevalence of anaemia and the cost per case prevented were taken into consideration.
Cross-sectional studies involved parasitological examination and anaemia evaluation before and at 10 months and 15 months after schoolchildren were dewormed.

FINDINGS
Baseline studies indicated that the prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 110 g/l) was high (54%) among schoolchildren, particularly those with high intensities of hookworm and schistosomiasis.
Attributable fraction analysis suggested that hookworm and schistosomiasis were responsible for 6% and 15% of anaemia cases, respectively.
Fifteen months after deworming with albendazole and praziquantel the prevalence of anaemia was reduced by a quarter and that of moderate-to- severe anaemia (haemoglobin <90 g/l) was reduced by nearly a half.
The delivery of these anthelmintics through the school system was achieved at the relatively low cost of US$ 1 per treated child.
The cost per anaemia case prevented by deworming schoolchildren was in the range US$ 6-8, depending on the haemoglobin threshold used.

CONCLUSION
The results suggested that deworming programmes should be included in public health strategies for the control of anaemia in schoolchildren where there are high prevalences of hookworm and schistosomiasis.

Title
Public-private partnerships for health: their main targets, their diversity, and their future directions.

Abstract
The global burden of disease, especially the part attributable to infectious diseases, disproportionately affects populations in developing countries.
Inadequate access to pharmaceuticals plays a role in perpetuating this disparity.
Drugs and vaccines may not be accessible because of weak distribution infrastructures or because development of the desired products has been neglected.
This situation can be tackled with push interventions to lower the costs and risks of product development for industry, with pull interventions providing economic and market incentives, and with the creation of infrastructures allowing products to be put into use.
If appropriately motivated, pharmaceutical companies can bring to partnerships expertise in product development, production process development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution - all of which are lacking in the public sector.
A large variety of public-private partnerships, combining the skills and resources of a wide range of collaborators, have arisen for product development, disease control through product donation and distribution, or the general strengthening or coordination of health services.
Administratively, such partnerships may either involve affiliation with international organizations, i.e. they are essentially public-sector programmes with private-sector participation, or they may be legally independent not-for-profit bodies.
These partnerships should be regarded as social experiments; they show promise but are not a panacea.
New ventures should be built on need, appropriateness, and lessons on good practice learnt from experience.
Suggestions are made for public, private, and joint activities that could help to improve the access of poor populations to the pharmaceuticals and health services they need.

Title
Initial lessons from public-private partnerships in drug and vaccine development.

Abstract
In recent years, venture capital approaches have delivered impressive results in identifying and funding promising health discoveries and bringing them to market.
This success has inspired public sector experiments with "social venture capital" approaches to address the dearth of affordable treatment and prevention for diseases of the developing world.
Employing the same focus on well-defined and measurable objectives, and the same type of connections to pool and deploy resources as their for-profit counterparts, social venture capitalists seek to use the tools and incentives of capitalism to solve one of its biggest failures: the lack of drugs and vaccines for diseases endemic to low-income populations.
As part of a larger trend of partnerships emerging in health product donation and distribution, public-private partnerships for pharmaceutical development have led research and development (R & D) efforts to generate more accessible and efficacious products for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS.
In this article, three R & D-focused partnerships are explored: the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; the Medicines for Malaria Venture; and the newly formed Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.
The article highlights key elements essential to the success of these ventures.

Title
Building local research and development capacity for the prevention and cure of neglected diseases: the case of India.

Abstract
This paper examines the proposal to build research and development (R & D) capabilities for dealing with neglected infectious and tropical diseases in countries where they are endemic, as a potentially cost- and time- effective way to fill the gap between the supply of and need for new medicines.
With reference to the situation in India, we consider the competencies and incentives needed by companies so that their strategy can be shifted from reverse engineering of existing products to investment in R & D for new products.
This requires complex reforms, of which the intellectual property rights agreement is only one.
We also consider whether Indian companies capable of conducting research and development are likely to target neglected diseases.
Patterns of patenting and of R & D, together with evidence from interviews we have conducted, suggest that Indian companies, like multinational corporations, are likely to target global diseases because of the prospect of much greater returns.
Further studies are required on how Indian companies would respond to push and pull incentives originally designed to persuade multinational corporations to do more R & D on neglected diseases.

Title
The etiology of maternal mortality in developing countries: what do verbal autopsies tell us?.

OBJECTIVE
To reassess the practical value of verbal autopsy data, which, in the absence of more definitive information, have been used to describe the causes of maternal mortality and to identify priorities in programmes intended to save women's lives in developing countries.

METHODS
We reanalysed verbal autopsy data from a study of 145 maternal deaths that occurred in Guerrero, Querétaro and San Luis Potosí, Mexico, in 1995, taking into account other causes of death and the WHO classification system.
The results were also compared with information given on imperfect death certificates.

FINDINGS
The reclassification showed wide variations in the attribution of maternal deaths to single specific medical causes.

CONCLUSION
The verbal autopsy methodology has inherent limitations as a means of obtaining histories of medical events.
At best it may reconfirm the knowledge that mortality among poor women with little access to medical care is higher than that among wealthier women who have better access to such care.

Title
The globalization of public health: the first 100 years of international health diplomacy.

Abstract
Global threats to public health in the 19th century sparked the development of international health diplomacy.
Many international regimes on public health issues were created between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries.
The present article analyses the global risks in this field and the international legal responses to them between 1851 and 1951, and explores the lessons from the first century of international health diplomacy of relevance to contemporary efforts to deal with the globalization of public health.

Title
Globalization, diet, and health: an example from Tonga.

Abstract
The increased flow of goods, people, and ideas associated with globalization have contributed to an increase in noncommunicable diseases in much of the world.
One response has been to encourage lifestyle changes with educational programmes, thus controlling the lifestyle-related disease.
Key assumptions with this approach are that people's food preferences are linked to their consumption patterns, and that consumption patterns can be transformed through educational initiatives.
To investigate these assumptions, and policies that derive from it, we undertook a broad-based survey of food-related issues in the Kingdom of Tonga using a questionnaire.
Data on the relationships between food preferences, perception of nutritional value, and frequency of consumption were gathered for both traditional and imported foods.
The results show that the consumption of health-compromising imported foods was unrelated either to food preferences or to perceptions of nutritional value, and suggests that diet-related diseases may not be amenable to interventions based on education campaigns.
Given recent initiatives towards trade liberalization and the creation of the World Trade Organization, tariffs or import bans may not serve as alternative measures to control consumption.
This presents significant challenges to health policy-makers serving economically marginal populations and suggests that some population health concerns cannot be adequately addressed without awareness of the effects of global trade.

Title
Global public goods and health: taking the agenda forward.

Abstract
We examined recent special health initiatives to control HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and make four policy recommendations for improving the sustainability of such initiatives.
First, international cooperation on health should be seen as an issue of global public goods that concerns both poor and rich countries.
Second, national health and other sector budgets should be tapped to ensure that global health concerns are fully and reliably funded; industrialized countries should lead the way.
Third, a global research council should be established to foster more efficient health-related knowledge management.
Fourth, managers for specific disease issues should be appointed, to facilitate policy partnerships.
Policy changes in these areas have already begun and can provide a basis for further reform.

Title
The Australian Measles Control Campaign, 1998.

Abstract
The 1998 Australian Measles Control Campaign had as its aim improved immunization coverage among children aged 1-12 years and, in the longer term, prevention of measles epidemics.
The campaign included mass school-based measles-mumps-rubella vaccination of children aged 5-12 years and a catch-up programme for preschool children.
More than 1.33 million children aged 5-12 years were vaccinated at school: serological monitoring showed that 94% of such children were protected after the campaign, whereas only 84% had been protected previously.
Among preschool children aged 1-3.5 years the corresponding levels of protection were 89% and 82%.
During the six months following the campaign there was a marked reduction in the number of measles cases among children in targeted age groups.

Title
Developing a scale for measuring the barriers to condom use in Nigeria.

OBJECTIVE
To describe the development of a scale for measuring the barriers to condom use in Nigeria and to evaluate its content, feasibility, reliability, and validity.

METHODS
The scale consists of 22 items and is structured on three dimensions: condom sexual satisfaction; condom health hazard; and condom sexual interest.
It was evaluated on a sample of 786 students attending the University of Ibadan, Nigeria.

FINDINGS
The scale appears to be easy to use, and is acceptable and reliable.

CONCLUSION
The scale appears suitable for obtaining estimates of personal experiences of sexual and reproductive condom use.
Further, it may be employed for assessing factors that hinder condom use in sexual relationships and is useful for determining the predisposition of individuals to use condoms in future sexual encounters.

Title
Secular increase in the incidence of hip fractures in Belgium between 1984 and 1996: need for a concerted public health strategy.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the incidence of hip fractures (at the proximal end of the femur) in Belgium from 1984 to 1996.

METHODS
Use was made of information from the national database on hospital bills, which fully covers the annual hospital stays in the whole of the country.

FINDINGS
The mean annual incidence of hip fractures increased from 107.8 to 140.5 per 100 000 inhabitants between 1984 and 1996.
The incidence of fractures of the femoral shaft (diaphysis), taken as a control, remained stable.
The female to male ratio of these hip fractures was 2.3:1.
Although the incidence by age group was identical for males and females, the fractures occurred approximately seven years earlier in women than in men.
The demographic changes observed in Belgium during this period accounted for only 10% of the observed increase in the number of hip fractures.

CONCLUSION
If no comprehensive preventive policy is set up promptly, there will be a sevenfold increase in the incidence of hip fractures between now and the year 2050 in Belgium.

Title
Effective screening programmes for cervical cancer in low- and middle-income developing countries.

Abstract
Cervical cancer is an important public health problem among adult women in developing countries in South and Central America, sub-Saharan Africa, and south and south-east Asia.
Frequently repeated cytology screening programmes ¾ either organized or opportunistic ¾ have led to a large decline in cervical cancer incidence and mortality in developed countries.
In contrast, cervical cancer remains largely uncontrolled in high-risk developing countries because of ineffective or no screening.
This article briefly reviews the experience from existing screening and research initiatives in developing countries.
Substantial costs are involved in providing the infrastructure, manpower, consumables, follow-up and surveillance for both organized and opportunistic screening programmes for cervical cancer.
Owing to their limited health care resources, developing countries cannot afford the models of frequently repeated screening of women over a wide age range that are used in developed countries.
Many low-income developing countries, including most in sub-Saharan Africa, have neither the resources nor the capacity for their health services to organize and sustain any kind of screening programme.
Middle-income developing countries, which currently provide inefficient screening, should reorganize their programmes in the light of experiences from other countries and lessons from their past failures.
Middle-income countries intending to organize a new screening programme should start first in a limited geographical area, before considering any expansion.
It is also more realistic and effective to target the screening on high-risk women once or twice in their lifetime using a highly sensitive test, with an emphasis on high coverage (>80%) of the targeted population.
Efforts to organize an effective screening programme in these developing countries will have to find adequate financial resources, develop the infrastructure, train the needed manpower, and elaborate surveillance mechanisms for screening, investigating, treating, and following up the targeted women.
The findings from the large body of research on various screening approaches carried out in developing countries and from the available managerial guidelines should be taken into account when reorganizing existing programmes and when considering new screening initiatives.

Title
Chronic respiratory diseases in developing countries: the burden and strategies for prevention and management.

Abstract
In developing countries, chronic respiratory diseases represent a challenge to public health because of their frequency, severity, projected trends, and economic impact.
Health care planners, for example, are faced with a dramatic increase in tobacco use and must establish priorities for the allocation of limited resources.
Nevertheless, smoking prevention and standardized management programmes for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be implemented in developing countries whenever possible.
International measures will be required to reverse tobacco smoking trends, and international agencies could define essential drugs and equipment and encourage the use of generic drugs, particularly for corticosteroids inhaled at high dosages.
For such programmes to be effective, producers of high-quality generics will need to be identified, and the medications added to national lists of essential drugs and included in procurement procedures.
Other recommendations for alleviating the burden of chronic respiratory diseases in developing countries are: adapting guidelines to local contexts and ensuring their distribution; upgrading equipment at district level; purchasing high-quality drugs at low prices; routine training and supervision of health services personnel; and regular monitoring of performance.
Social mobilization by professional societies, nongovernmental organizations, and the mass media will also increase government commitment to tobacco control and standardized case management.

Title
Comparison of two training strategies for essential newborn care in Brazil.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the effectiveness of two training strategies for improving essential newborn care in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil.

METHODS
Eight hospitals were selected, divided into two groups of four, and paired by geographical, structural, and functional characteristics.
Doctors and nurses working at hospitals in Group 1 were given a conventional 5-day training course.
Those in Group 2 were given the same manual used by Group 1 but the training course was organized as self-directed learning, with the participants having 5 weeks to complete the course.
Participants' knowledge was tested at baseline, immediately after the course, and 3-6 months later.
Participants' practices were observed before training and 3-6 months after training during 20 births and by interviewing 20 mothers before discharge at each hospital.

FINDINGS
Not all participants completed all of the tests.
The scores on the tests of knowledge improved more among those in Group 2 than those in Group 1 when the answers were classified as right or wrong, but there was no difference between groups when a scoring method was used that classified answers as correct, partially correct, incorrect, or missing.
Practices related to thermal control after birth improved among those in Group 2 after training but practices related to thermal control on the ward worsened.
The promotion of breastfeeding improved in both groups.

CONCLUSION
There was no difference between the two training strategies, although self-directed learning was cheaper than conventional training.
Neither strategy brought about the expected improvements in the quality of care.
Other interventions in addition to training may be needed to improve care.

Title
Immune response to measles vaccine in Peruvian children.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the immune response in Peruvian children following measles vaccination.

METHODS
Fifty-five Peruvian children received Schwarz measles vaccine (about 103 plaque forming units) at about 9 months of age.
Blood samples were taken before vaccination, then twice after vaccination: one sample at between 1 and 4 weeks after vaccination and the final sample 3 months post vaccination for evaluation of immune cell phenotype and lymphoproliferative responses to measles and non-measles antigens.
Measles-specific antibodies were measured by plaque reduction neutralization.

FINDINGS
The humoral response developed rapidly after vaccination; only 4 of the 55 children (7%) had plaque reduction neutralization titres <200 mIU/ml 3 months after vaccination.
However, only 8 out of 35 children tested (23%) had lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens 3-4 weeks after vaccination.
Children with poor lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens had readily detectable lymphoproliferative responses to other antigens.
Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed diffuse immune system activation at the time of vaccination in most children.
The capacity to mount a lymphoproliferative response to measles antigens was associated with expression of CD45RO on CD4+ T-cells.

CONCLUSION
The 55 Peruvian children had excellent antibody responses after measles vaccination, but only 23% (8 out of 35) generated detectable lymphoproliferative responses to measles antigens (compared with 55- 67% in children in the industrialized world).
This difference may contribute to the less than uniform success of measles vaccination programmes in the developing world.

Title
Antibody response to 17D yellow fever vaccine in Ghanaian infants.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the seroresponses to yellow fever vaccination at 6 and 9 months of age; assess any possible adverse effects of immunization with the 17D yellow fever vaccine in infants, particularly at 6 months of age.

METHODS
Four hundred and twenty infants who had completed BCG, OPV and DPT immunizations were randomized to receive yellow fever immunization at either 6 or 9 months.
A single dose of 0.5 ml of the reconstituted vaccine was administered to each infant by subcutaneous injection.
To determine the yellow fever antibody levels of the infants, each donated 1 ml whole blood prior to immunization and 3 months post-immunization.
Each serum sample was titred on Vero cells against the vaccine virus.

FINDINGS
The most common adverse reactions reported were fever, cough, diarrhoea and mild reactions at the inoculation site.
The incidences of adverse reactions were not statistically different in both groups.
None of the pre-immunization sera in both age groups had detectable yellow fever antibodies.
Infants immunized at 6 months recorded seroconversion of 98.6% and those immunized at 9 months recorded 98% seroconversion.
The GMT of their antibodies were 158.5 and 129.8, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that seroresponses to yellow fever immunization at 6 and 9 months as determined by seroconversion and GMTs of antibodies are similar.
The findings of good seroresponses at 6 months without significant adverse effects would suggest that the 17D yellow fever vaccine could be recommended for use in children at 6 months in outbreak situations or in high risk endemic areas.

Title
International response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic: planning for success.

Abstract
More assertive political leadership in the global response to AIDS in both poor and rich countries culminated in June 2001 at the UN General Assembly Special Session on AIDS.
Delegates made important commitments there, and endorsed a global strategy framework for shifting the dynamics of the epidemic by simultaneously reducing risk, vulnerability and impact.
This points the way to achievable progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
Evidence of success in tackling the spread of AIDS comes from diverse programme areas, including work with sex workers and clients, injecting drug users, and young people.
It also comes from diverse countries, including India, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Thailand, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia.
Their common feature is the combination of focused approaches with attention to the societywide context within which risk occurs.
Similarly, building synergies between prevention and care has underpinned success in Brazil and holds great potential for sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% reductions have been achieved in the prices at which antiretroviral drugs are available.
Success also involves overcoming stigma, which undermines community action and blocks access to services.
Work against stigma and discrimination has been effectively carried out in both health sector and occupational settings.
Accompanying attention to the conditions for success against HIV/AIDS is global consensus on the need for additional resources.
The detailed estimate of required AIDS spending in low- and middle-income countries is US$ 9.2 billion annually, compared to the $ 2 billion currently spent.
Additional spending should be mobilized by the new global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, but needs to be joined by additional government and private efforts within countries, including from debt relief.
Commitment and capacity to scale up HIV prevention and care have never been stronger.
The moment must be seized to prevent a global catastrophe.

Title
The effectiveness of HIV prevention and the epidemiological context.

Abstract
Planning an intervention to prevent infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be guided by local epidemiological and socioeconomic conditions.
The socioeconomic setting and existing public service capacity determine whether an intervention can have a significant outcome in terms of a reduction in a defined risk.
The epidemiological context determines whether such risk reduction translates into a measurable impact on HIV incidence.
Measurement of variables describing the epidemiological context can be used to determine the local suitability of interventions, thereby guiding planners and policy-makers in their choice of intervention.
Such measurements also permit the retrospective analysis of the impact of interventions where HIV incidence was not recorded.
The epidemiological context is defined for four different categories of intervention, shown to be effective in lower-income countries by randomized controlled trials.
Appropriate indicators for the epidemiological context and methodological guidelines for their measurement are proposed.
Their use in the transfer of a successful intervention from one context to another and in scaling up the effort to control HIV infection is explored.
These indicators should provide a useful resource for those involved in planning HIV prevention interventions.

Title
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV: challenges for the current decade.

Abstract
In June 2001 the United Nations Special Assembly on HIV/AIDS set reduction targets of 20% and 50% for the numbers of children newly infected with HIV by 2005 and 2010 respectively.
Are these targets achievable?
Antiretroviral monotherapy during pregnancy, delivery, and the neonatal period can reduce the rate of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 by two-thirds in non-breastfeeding populations.
Shorter and simpler regimens of monotherapy have been associated with a reduction of 50% in such transmission among non-breastfeeding populations and of up to 40% in breastfeeding populations.
Delivery by elective caesarean section is associated with a halving of the risk of mother-to-child transmission.
However, breastfeeding poses a substantial additional risk of acquisition of HIV, and if prolonged it more than doubles the overall rate of transmission.
Rates below 2% are being reported from settings where combination therapy is applied during pregnancy and delivery, delivery is by elective caesarean section, and breastfeeding does not take place.
In breastfeeding populations where elective caesarean delivery is not an option but peripartum antiretroviral therapy is used, rates at six weeks are about 10% but can be 25% or more after 18 months of breastfeeding.
More widely applicable interventions are being developed, such as cleansing of the birth canal and antiretroviral therapy during the breastfeeding period.

Title
Etiology of child mortality in Goroka, Papua New Guinea: a prospective two-year study.

OBJECTIVE
To collect accurate data on disease- and microbial-specific causes and avoidable factors in child deaths in a developing country.

METHODS
A systematic prospective audit of deaths of children seen at Goroka Hospital in the highlands of Papua New Guinea was carried out.
Over a 24-month period, we studied 353 consecutive deaths of children: 126 neonates, 186 children aged 1-59 months, and 41 children aged 5-12 years.

FINDINGS
The most frequent age-specific clinical diagnoses were as follows: for neonates - very low birth weight, septicaemia, birth asphyxia and congenital syphilis; for children aged 1-59 months - pneumonia, septicaemia, marasmus and meningitis; and for children aged 5-12 years - malignancies and septicaemia.
At least one microbial cause of death was identified for 179 (50.7%) children and two or more were identified for 37 (10.5%).
Nine microbial pathogens accounted for 41% of all childhood deaths and 76% of all deaths that had any infective component.
Potentially avoidable factors were identified for 177 (50%) of deaths.
The most frequently occurring factors were as follows: no antenatal care in high-risk pregnancies (8.8% of all deaths), very delayed presentation (7.9%), vaccine-preventable diseases (7.9%), informal adoption or child abandonment leading to severe malnutrition (5.7%), and lack of screening for maternal syphilis (5.4%).
Sepsis due to enteric Gram-negative bacilli occurred in 87 (24.6%).
The strongest associations with death from Gram- negative sepsis were adoption/abandonment leading to severe malnutrition, village births, and prolonged hospital stay.

CONCLUSIONS
Reductions in child mortality will depend on addressing the commonest causes of death, which include disease states, microbial pathogens, adverse social circumstances and health service failures.
Systematic mortality audits in selected regions where child mortality is high may be useful for setting priorities, estimating the potential benefit of specific and non-specific interventions, and providing continuous feedback on the quality of care provided and the outcome of health reforms.

Title
Monitoring one-year compliance to antihypertension medication in the Seychelles.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the compliance to medication among newly diagnosed hypertensive patients screened from the general population of the Seychelles, a rapidly developing country.

METHODS
Among the 1067 participants to a population-based survey for cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension was discovered in 50 (previously unaware of having hypertension and having blood pressure ³160/95 mmHg over 3 visits).
These 50 patients were placed on a daily one-pill regimen of medication (bendrofluazide, atenolol, or a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol) and compliance to the regimen was assessed over 12 months using electronic pill containers.
Satisfactory compliance was defined as taking the medication on 6 or 7 days a week on average (which corresponds to a mean compliance level of ³86%).

FINDINGS
In the first month, fewer than half (46%) of the new hypertension patients achieved satisfactory compliance, and only about one-quarter (26%) achieved this level by the twelfth month.
Compliance was better among the 23 participants who regularly attended medical follow-up, with nearly three-quarters of these patients (74%) achieving satisfactory compliance during the first month and over one-half (55%) by the twelfth month.
There was a direct association between mean 12-month compliance level and having a highly skilled occupation; having good health awareness; and regularly attending medical appointments.
In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between mean compliance level and heavy drinking.

CONCLUSION
The low proportion of people selected from the general population who were capable of sustaining satisfactory compliance to antihypertension medication may correspond to the maximum effectiveness of medication interventions based on a screening and treatment strategy in the general population.
The results stress the need for both high-risk and population approaches to improve hypertension control.

Title
An economic analysis of midwifery training programmes in South Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Abstract
In order to improve the knowledge and skills of midwives at health facilities and those based in villages in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, three in-service training programmes were carried out during 1995-98.
A scheme used for both facility and village midwives included training at training centres, peer review and continuing education.
One restricted to village midwives involved an internship programme in district hospitals.
The incremental cost-effectiveness of these programmes was assessed from the standpoint of the health care provider.
It was estimated that the first scheme could be expanded to increase the number of competent midwives based in facilities and villages in South Kalimantan by 1% at incremental costs of US$ 764.6 and US$ 1175.7 respectively, and that replication beyond South Kalimantan could increase the number of competent midwives based in facilities and villages by 1% at incremental costs of US$ 1225.5 and US$ 1786.4 per midwife respectively.
It was also estimated that the number of competent village midwives could be increased by 1% at an incremental cost of US$ 898.1 per intern if replicated elsewhere, and at a cost of US$ 146.2 per intern for expanding the scheme in South Kalimantan.
It was not clear whether the training programmes were more or less cost-effective than other safe motherhood interventions because the nature of the outcome measures hindered comparison.

Title
Modelling HIV/AIDS epidemics in Botswana and India: impact of interventions to prevent transmission.

OBJECTIVE
To describe a dynamic compartmental simulation model for Botswana and India, developed to identify the best strategies for preventing spread of HIV/AIDS.

METHODS
The following interventions were considered: a behavioural intervention focused on female sex workers; a conventional programme for the treatment of sexually transmitted infections; a programme for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission; an antiretroviral treatment programme for the entire population, based on a single regimen; and an antiretroviral treatment programme for sex workers only, also based on a single regimen.

FINDINGS
The interventions directed at sex workers as well as those dealing with sexually transmitted infections showed promise for long-term prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, although their relative ranking was uncertain.
In India, a sex worker intervention would drive the epidemic to extinction.
In Botswana none of the interventions alone would achieve this, although the prevalence of HIV would be reduced by almost 50%.
Mother-to-child transmission programmes could reduce HIV transmission to infants, but would have no impact on the epidemic itself.
In the long run, interventions targeting sexual transmission would be even more effective in reducing the number of HIV-infected children than mother-to-child transmission programmes.
Antiretroviral therapy would prevent transmission in the short term, but eventually its effects would wane because of the development of drug resistance.

CONCLUSION
Depending on the country and how the antiretroviral therapy was targeted, 25-100% of HIV cases would be drug- resistant after 30 years of use.

Title
Health, nutrition and prosperity: a microeconomic perspective.

Abstract
A positive correlation between health and economic prosperity has been widely documented, but the extent to which this reflects a causal effect of health on economic outcomes is very controversial.
Two classes of evidence are examined.
First, carefully designed random assignment studies in the laboratory and field provide compelling evidence that nutritional deficiency - particularly iron deficiency - reduces work capacity and, in some cases, work output.
Confidence in these results is bolstered by a good understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.
Some random assignment studies indicate an improved yield from health services in the labour market.
Second, observational studies suggest that general markers of nutritional status, such as height and body mass index (BMI), are significant predictors of economic success although their interpretation is confounded by the fact that they reflect influences from early childhood and family background.
Energy intake and possibly the quality of the diet have also been found to be predictive of economic success in observational studies.
However, the identification of causal pathways in these studies is difficult and involves statistical assumptions about unobserved heterogeneity that are difficult to test.
Illustrations using survey data demonstrate the practical importance of this concern.
Furthermore, failure to take into account the dynamic interplay between changes in health and economic status has led to limited progress being reported in the literature.
A broadening of random assignment studies to measure the effects of an intervention on economic prosperity, investment in population-based longitudinal socioeconomic surveys, and application of emerging technologies for a better measure of health in these surveys will yield very high returns in improving our understanding of how health influences economic prosperity.

Title
Trade in health services.

Abstract
In light of the increasing globalization of the health sector, this article examines ways in which health services can be traded, using the mode-wise characterization of trade defined in the General Agreement on Trade in Services.
The trade modes include cross- border delivery of health services via physical and electronic means, and cross-border movement of consumers, professionals, and capital.
An examination of the positive and negative implications of trade in health services for equity, efficiency, quality, and access to health care indicates that health services trade has brought mixed benefits and that there is a clear role for policy measures to mitigate the adverse consequences and facilitate the gains.
Some policy measures and priority areas for action are outlined, including steps to address the "brain drain"; increasing investment in the health sector and prioritizing this investment better; and promoting linkages between private and public health care services to ensure equity.
Data collection, measures, and studies on health services trade all need to be improved, to assess better the magnitude and potential implications of this trade.
In this context, the potential costs and benefits of trade in health services are shaped by the underlying structural conditions and existing regulatory, policy, and infrastructure in the health sector.
Thus, appropriate policies and safeguard measures are required to take advantage of globalization in health services.

Title
Growth performance of affluent Indian children is similar to that in developed countries.

OBJECTIVE
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in order to determine whether an affluent population in south Delhi had a growth performance similar to that in developed countries and to identify socioeconomic factors that militated against optimal growth in this group.

METHODS
The weights and lengths of 395 children aged 12-23 months and the heights of 331 mothers and 153 grandmothers were measured and information was obtained on family socioeconomic status and child-feeding practices.
Children born prematurely, i.e. before 37 weeks of gestation, and those with illness adversely affecting growth, were excluded from the analysis, as with the NCHS/WHO reference population.

RESULTS
In 341 children included in the analysis, the mean Z-scores for weight-for-age, length-for-age and weight-for-length were -0.45, -0.28 and -0.32 respectively.
About 6% of the children were underweight (weight-for-age Z-score £-2), 3% were stunted (length-for-age Z-score £-2), and 4% were wasted (weight-for-length Z-score £-2).
The factors that were significantly associated with higher length-for-age were one or both parents having 17 years or more of education (mean length-for-age Z-score -0.17) and non-vegetarian diet (mean length-for-age Z-score - 0.18).
No socioeconomic factors were associated with mean weight-for-length.

CONCLUSION
The children in this affluent population were close to the NCHS/WHO reference population with regard to anthropometric indicators.
The subpopulation with higher parental education had even better growth.
It is intended to include this subpopulation in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study.

Title
Preferences of urban Zimbabweans for health and life lived at different ages.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the age-weighting preferences of urban Zimbabweans in relation to health care priorities.

METHOD
A total of 67 randomly selected residents of a high-density area of Harare participated in the study.
Participants were asked "person trade-off" questions to determine their preferences in terms of the numbers of people of various ages who would be saved from death and from suffering a year of ill-health relative to the number of 30-year-olds who would be saved from these eventualities.

FINDINGS
The responses indicate that the value of averting a year of ill-health was judged greatest for 15-year-olds and was equal for people aged 1, 30, and 45 years.
The value of averting a death primarily reflected the expected years of life lost, but the influence of age-weighting was evident in that 15 years was the most highly valued age.

CONCLUSION
Although the age-weighting curves did not correspond exactly with the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) age-weights, Zimbabweans showed a preference for saving the lives of young adults.
The GBD age-weights should be used to determine the disability-adjusted life years lost in the Zimbabwean population.

Title
Interventions to reduce tuberculosis mortality and transmission in low- and middle-income countries.

Abstract
Tuberculosis is among the top ten causes of global mortality and affects low-income countries in particular.
This paper examines, through a literature review, the impact of tuberculosis control measures on tuberculosis mortality and transmission, and constraints to scaling-up.
It also provides estimates of the effectiveness of various interventions using a model proposed by Styblo.
It concludes that treatment of smear-positive tuberculosis using the WHO directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy has by far the highest impact.
While BCG immunization reduces childhood tuberculosis mortality, its impact on tuberculosis transmission is probably minimal.
Under specific conditions, an additional impact on mortality and transmission can be expected through treatment of smear-negative cases, intensification of case-finding for smear-positive tuberculosis, and preventive therapy among individuals with dual tuberculosis-HIV infection.
Of these interventions, DOTS is the most cost-effective at around US$ 5-40 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained.
The cost for BCG immunization is likely to be under US$ 50 per DALY gained.
Treatment of smear-negative patients has a cost per DALY gained of up to US$ 100 in low-income countries, and up to US$ 400 in middle-income settings.
Other interventions, such as preventive therapy for HIV-positive individuals, appear to be less cost-effective.
The major constraint to scaling up DOTS is lack of political commitment, resulting in shortages of funding and human resources for tuberculosis control.
However, in recent years there have been encouraging signs of increasing political commitment.
Other constraints are related to involvement of the private sector, health sector reform, management capacity of tuberculosis programmes, treatment delivery, and drug supply.
Global tuberculosis control could benefit strongly from technical innovation, including the development of a vaccine giving good protection against smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in adults; simpler and shorter drug regimens for treatment of tuberculosis disease and infection; and improved diagnostics for tuberculosis infection and disease.

Title
Questionnaires for rapid screening of schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa.

Abstract
New initiatives are aiming to reduce the global burden of schistosomiasis, mainly through the large-scale application of chemotherapy.
To target chemotherapy effectively, rapid assessment procedures are needed for identifying high-risk communities that are foci for the disease.
In this review, we examine the development and validation of simple school questionnaires for screening communities for Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni rapidly and inexpensively.
The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, where 85% of the current schistosomiasis burden is concentrated.
For more than a decade, the questionnaire approach has been validated in 10 countries, with 133 880 children interviewed in 1282 schools, and with 54 996 children examined for S. haematobium.
The questionnaires were well accepted, highly reliable, and of low cost.
The success of the questionnaires is explained by the fact that S. haematobium infections were easily perceived through the presence of blood in urine.
Evidence from 48 258 children interviewed in 545 schools indicated that reported blood in stools and bloody diarrhoea are valuable indicators for community diagnosis of S. mansoni.
However, the diagnostic performance of the questionnaires for S. mansoni was weaker than for S. haematobium, and although these results are encouraging, the questionnaires need additional validation.
Recently, questionnaires were extended from community to individual diagnosis and showed considerable promise.
Questionnaires are now available for promptly defining the magnitude of schistosomiasis in a large area, which will allow limited resources for morbidity control to be allocated optimally.

Title
Time to focus child survival programmes on the newborn: assessment of levels and causes of infant mortality in rural Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE
Population-based surveys were conducted in selected clusters of Pakistan's least developed provinces, Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), to assess levels and causes of neonatal and postneonatal mortality.

METHODS
Interviews were conducted in a total of 54 834 households: Balochistan, 20 486; NWFP, 26 175; and FATA, 8173.
Trained interviewers administered questionnaires after obtaining verbal informed consent from the respondents.
Verbal autopsy interviews were conducted for infant deaths reported for the previous year.

FINDINGS
The infant mortality rate based on combined data from the different sites was 99.7 per 1000 live births (range 129.0-70.1).
The contribution of neonatal deaths to all infant deaths was much higher for NWFP (67.2%), where the overall rate was lowest, than for Balochistan (50.8%) and FATA (56.8%).
Around 70% of all neonatal deaths occurred in the early neonatal period.
The three main clinical causes of infant deaths were diarrhoea syndrome (21.6%), tetanus (11.7%) and acute respiratory infections (11.6%).
In the neonatal period, however, tetanus (18.3%), small size for gestational age or low birth weight (15.3%), and birth injury (12.0%) accounted for nearly half (45.6%) of all deaths, while the contributions of diarrhoea syndrome (5.1%) and acute respiratory infections (6.0%) were less significant (11.1%).
Tetanus was the cause of death for 21.7% and 17.1% of all infant deaths in FATA and NWFP respectively.

CONCLUSION
The results suggest that there should be a shift in child survival programmes to give greater emphasis to maternal and neonatal health, in particular to maternal tetanus immunization, safe delivery and cord care.

Title
Prevalence of nutritional wasting in populations: building explanatory models using secondary data.

OBJECTIVE
To understand how social context affects the nutritional status of populations, as reflected by the prevalence of wasting in children under 5 years of age from Africa, Latin America, and Asia; to present a systematic way of building models for wasting prevalence, using a conceptual framework for the determinants of malnutrition; and to examine the feasibility of using readily available data collected over time to build models of wasting prevalence in populations.

METHODS
Associations between prevalence of wasting and environmental variables were examined in the three regions.
General linear mixed models were fitted using anthropometric survey data for countries within each region.

FINDINGS
Low birth weight (LBW), measles incidence, and access to a safe water supply explained 64% of wasting variability in Asia.
In Latin America, LBW and survey year explained 38%; in Africa, LBW, survey year, and adult literacy explained 7%.

CONCLUSION
LBW emerged as a predictor of wasting prevalence in all three regions.
Actions regarding women's rights may have an effect on the nutritional status of children since LBW seems to reflect several aspects of the conditions of women in society.
Databases have to be made compatible with each other to facilitate integrated analysis for nutritional research and policy decision-making.
In addition, the validity of the variables representing the conceptual framework should be improved.

Title
Gender and use of cataract surgical services in developing countries.

OBJECTIVE
To determine, from the existing literature, cataract surgical coverage rates by sex and the proportion of cataract blindness that could be eliminated if women and men had equal access to cataract surgical services.

METHOD
Methodologically sound population-based cataract surveys from developing countries were identified through a literature search.
Cataract surgical coverage rates were extracted from the surveys and rates for women were compared to those for men.
Peto odds ratios were calculated for each survey and a meta-analysis of the surveys was performed.

FINDINGS
From a literature review and meta-analysis of cataract surveys in developing countries, we found that the cataract surgical coverage rate was 1.2-1.7 times higher for males than for females.
For females, the odds ratio of having surgery, compared to males, was 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60- 0.74).
Despite their lower coverage rate, females accounted for approximately 63% of all cataract cases in the study populations, and if they received surgery at the same rates as males, the prevalence of cataract blindness would be reduced by a median of 12.5% (range 4-21%).

CONCLUSION
Closing the gender gap could thus significantly decrease the prevalence of cataract blindness, and gender-sensitive intervention programmes are needed to improve cataract surgical coverage among females.

Title
Can post-eradication laboratory containment of wild polioviruses be achieved?.

Abstract
The purpose of containment is to prevent reintroduction of wild polioviruses from laboratories into polio-free communities.
In order to achieve global commitment to laboratory containment the rationale should be clear and compelling; the biosafety levels should be justified by the risks; and the objectives should be realistic.
Absolute containment can never be assured.
Questions of intentional or unintentional non-compliance can never be wholly eliminated.
Effective laboratory containment is, however, a realistic goal.
Prevention of virus transmission through contaminated laboratory materials is addressed by WHO standards for biosafety.
The principal challenge is to prevent transmission through unrecognized infectious laboratory workers.
Such transmission is possible only if the following conditions occur: infectious and potentially infectious materials carrying wild poliovirus are present in the laboratory concerned; a laboratory operation exposes a worker to poliovirus; a worker is susceptible to an infection that results in the shedding of poliovirus; and the community is susceptible to poliovirus infections.
At present it is difficult to envisage the elimination of any of these conditions.
However, the risks of the first three can be greatly reduced so as to create a formidable barrier against poliovirus transmission to the community.
Final biosafety recommendations must await post-eradication immunization policies adopted by the international community.

Title
Tobacco use in Tunisia: behaviour and awareness.

OBJECTIVE
To assess tobacco use and the awareness of and attitudes towards tobacco and its control in the adult population of Tunisia.

METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1996 of a representative national sample of 5696 subjects aged 25 and over.
Data were collected by means of a questionnaire in Arabic.

FINDINGS
Tobacco use was reported by 30.4% of the respondents, of whom 24.6% smoked cigarettes and 5.8% consumed traditional tobacco, i.e. snuff, chewing tobacco and/or water pipe tobacco.
Whereas 55.6% of men used tobacco, only 5.2% of women did so.
Among men the proportion of tobacco users diminished with age as the rate of cessation increased.
Among women, smoking peaked in the 35-54 age group.
The proportion of men consuming traditional tobacco alone increased from 2.4% in the 25-34 age group to 20.4% in the 55+ age group; the corresponding values for women were 0.1% and 14.3%.
Tobacco use was more widespread in rural than in urban areas and was relatively high among poorly educated men from economically deprived backgrounds.
The use of tobacco was believed to be harmful to health by 98.6% of the respondents.
Over 90% of the interviewees were aware that tobacco played a part in the development of heart disease.
However, there were some gaps in awareness.
A fear of cancer was expressed by 85% of the respondents, whereas only 5.6% were fearful of accidents.

CONCLUSIONS
Informational and educational campaigns relating to tobacco control should be directed at individuals and communities, taking into account the gaps in awareness of the effects of tobacco on health.

Title
Can ivermectin mass treatments eliminate onchocerciasis in Africa?.

OBJECTIVE
To elucidate the conditions in which mass treatment with ivermectin reduces the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus sufficiently to eliminate infection from an African community.

METHODS
ONCHOSIM, a microsimulation model for onchocerciasis transmission, was used to explore the implications of different treatment intervals, coverage levels and precontrol endemicities for the likelihood of elimination.

FINDINGS
Simulations suggested that control strategies based exclusively on ivermectin mass treatments could eliminate onchocerciasis.
The duration of treatment required to eliminate infection depended heavily on the treatment programme and precontrol endemicity.
In areas with medium to high levels of infection, annual mass treatments with 65% coverage for at least 25 years were necessary.
Model predictions suggested that durations exceeding 35 years would be required if there were much heterogeneity in exposure to vector bites and, consequently, wide individual variation in microfilaria counts.
If the treatment interval were reduced from 12 to 6 months the time for completion of the programme could be more than halved and elimination could be accomplished in areas of hyperendemicity, provided that the effects of each treatment would be the same as with annual treatments.
However, it was doubtful whether high coverage levels could be sustained long enough to achieve worldwide eradication.

CONCLUSION
Elimination of onchocerciasis from most endemic foci in Africa appears to be possible.
However, the requirements in terms of duration, coverage, and frequency of treatment may be prohibitive in highly endemic areas.

Title
Low access to a highly effective therapy: a challenge for international tuberculosis control.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the scale of the tuberculosis (TB) problem facing the international Stop TB Partnership by measuring the gap between present rates of case detection and treatment success, and the global targets (70% and 85%, respectively) to be reached by 2005 under the WHO DOTS strategy.

METHODS
We analysed case notifications submitted annually to WHO from up to 202 (of 210) countries and territories between 1980 and 2000, and the results of treatment for patients registered between 1994 and 1999.

FINDINGS
Many of the 148 national DOTS programmes in existence by the end of 2000 have shown that they can achieve high treatment success rates, close to or exceeding the target of 85%.
However, we estimate that only 27% of all the new smear-positive cases that arose in 2000 were notified under DOTS, and only 19% were successfully treated.
The increment in case-finding has been steady at about 133 000 additional smear-positive cases in each year since 1994.
In the interval 1999- 2000, more than half of the extra cases notified under DOTS were in Ethiopia, India, Myanmar, the Philippines, and South Africa.

CONCLUSION
With the current rate of progress in DOTS expansion, the target of 70% case detection will not be reached until 2013.
To reach this target by 2005, DOTS programmes must find an additional 333 000 cases each year.
The challenge now is to show that DOTS expansion in the major endemic countries can significantly accelerate case finding while maintaining high cure rates.

Title
DOTS-based tuberculosis treatment and control during civil conflict and an HIV epidemic, Churachandpur District, India.

OBJECTIVE
To pilot the WHO guidelines on DOTS for tuberculosis (TB) among displaced people affected by conflict in Churachandpur District, Manipur State, north-east India, which has endured an HIV epidemic, injecting drug use, civil unrest, high levels of TB, and poor TB treatment and prevention services for many years.

METHODS
Prerequisites for TB control programmes were established.
WHO guidelines and protocols were adapted for local use.
Outreach workers were appointed from each ethnic group involved in the conflict, and training was conducted.
Quality control and evaluation processes were introduced.

FINDINGS
TB was diagnosed in 178 people between June and December 1998.
Of the 170 with pulmonary disease, 85 were smear-positive.
Successful outcomes were recorded in 91% of all patients and in 86% of smear-positive cases of pulmonary TB.
The default rate and the mortality rate were low at 3% each.
HIV positive serostatus was the only factor associated with a poor treatment outcome.

CONCLUSION
TB treatment and control were possible in a conflict setting and WHO targets for cure were attainable.
The factors associated with the success of the programme were strong local community support, the selection of outreach workers from each ethnic group to allow access to all areas and patients, the use of directly observed therapy three times a week instead of daily in the interest of increased safety, and the limiting of distances travelled by both outreach workers and patients.

Title
Highly active antiretroviral therapy and tuberculosis control in Africa: synergies and potential.

Abstract
HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and TB (tuberculosis) are two of the world's major pandemics, the brunt of which falls on sub-Saharan Africa.
Efforts aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS have largely focused on prevention, little attention having been paid to care.
Work on TB control has concentrated on case detection and treatment.
HIV infection has complicated the control of tuberculosis.
There is unlikely to be a decline in the number of cases of TB unless additional strategies are developed to control both this disease and HIV simultaneously.
Such strategies would include active case-finding in situations where TB transmission is high, the provision of a package of care for HIV-related illness, and the application of highly active antiretroviral therapy.
The latter is likely to have the greatest impact, but for this therapy to become more accessible in Africa the drugs would have to be made available through international support and a programme structure would have to be developed for its administration.
It could be delivered by means of a structure based on the five-point strategy called DOTS, which has been adopted for TB control.
However, it may be unrealistic to give TB control programmes the responsibility for running such a programme.
A better approach might be to deliver highly active antiretroviral therapy within a comprehensive HIV/AIDS management strategy complementing the preventive work already being undertaken by AIDS control programmes.
TB programmes could contribute towards the development and implementation of this strategy.

Title
Hepatitis B vaccination in prisons.

Abstract
The opportunities and problems for hepatitis B vaccination programmes in prison settings are discussed.
In particular, the advantages of modelling are stressed and an active case-finding approach is advocated.
Measures for maintaining good case-holding are also discussed, and a 0, 1, 2 months vaccination regimen with 20 µg doses of vaccine is advocated for prison settings.
A higher reference level for inferring adequate immunization is also recommended, with booster injections for inmates who do not meet the higher reference after a primary course of vaccination.

Title
When staff is underpaid: dealing with the individual coping strategies of health personnel.

Abstract
Health sector workers respond to inadequate salaries and working conditions by developing various individual "coping strategies" - some, but not all, of which are of a predatory nature.
The paper reviews what is known about these practices and their potential consequences (competition for time, brain drain and conflicts of interest).
By and large, governments have rarely been proactive in dealing with such problems, mainly because of their reluctance to address the issue openly.
The effectiveness of many of these piecemeal reactions, particularly attempts to prohibit personnel from developing individual coping strategies, has been disappointing.
The paper argues that a more proactive approach is required.
Governments will need to recognize the dimension of the phenomenon and systematically assess the consequences of policy initiatives on the situation and behaviour of the individuals that make up their workforce.

Title
Cost of malaria control in China: Henan's consolidation programme from community and government perspectives.

OBJECTIVE
To assist with strategic planning for the eradication of malaria in Henan Province, China, which reached the consolidation phase of malaria control in 1992, when only 318 malaria cases were reported.

METHODS
We conducted a prospective two-year study of the costs for Henan's malaria control programme.
We used a cost model that could also be applied to other malaria programmes in mainland China, and analysed the cost of the three components of Henan's malaria programme: suspected malaria case management, vector surveillance, and population blood surveys.
Primary cost data were collected from the government, and data on suspected malaria patients were collected in two malaria counties (population 2 093 100).
We enlisted the help of 260 village doctors in six townships or former communes (population 247 762), and studied all 12 325 reported cases of suspected malaria in their catchment areas in 1994 and 1995.

FINDINGS
The average annual government investment in malaria control was estimated to be US$ 111 516 (case-management 59%; active blood surveys 25%; vector surveillance 12%; and contingencies and special projects 4%).
The average cost (direct and indirect) for patients seeking treatment for suspected malaria was US$ 3.48, equivalent to 10 days' income for rural residents.
Each suspected malaria case cost the government an average of US$ 0.78.

CONCLUSION
Further cuts in government funding will increase future costs when epidemic malaria returns; investment in malaria control should therefore continue at least at current levels of US$ 0.03 per person at risk.

Title
Gender, literacy, and survival among Ethiopian adults, 1987 - 96.

OBJECTIVE
To examine relationships between gender, literacy and survival among adults in Meskan and Mareko district, Ethiopia.

METHODS
On the basis of an established demographic surveillance system, an open-cohort analysis of 172 726 person-years covering the period January 1987 to December 1996 was conducted in 10 randomly selected local communities.

FINDINGS
The crude mortality rate was 11.2 per 1000 person-years among adults aged ³15 years; the values for males and females were 11.9 and 10.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively.
Kaplan - Meier estimates showed that literacy and being female were both favourable for survival throughout adulthood.
Cox's regression models showed that age, gender, literacy and area (rural lowland, rural highland and urban) were significant factors in survival: younger, female, literate urban dwellers were the most favoured.
Gender differences in mortality were small in the rural areas, possibly because of the harsh living conditions and the marginalization of women.
Literacy was a more significant factor for survival in the rural areas, where mortality was highest, while gender was more important in the one urban area studied.
The levels of literacy were lowest among rural females.

CONCLUSION
Special attention should be given to raising literacy levels among rural women with a view to improving their survival.

Title
Vaccination against hepatitis A virus may not be required for schoolchildren in northern India: results of a seroepidemiological survey.

OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the current seroprevalence of antibodies against hepatitis A virus (HAV) in a sample of schoolchildren above 10 years of age and to determine the prevalence of HAV-induced hepatitis in adults at a tertiary care hospital in northern India between January 1992 and December 2000.

METHODS
Sera from 276 male and 224 female schoolchildren aged 10-17 years were tested for anti-HAV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Consecutive patients with a diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis who attended a liver clinic were tested for the serological markers of HAV, hepatitis B Virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E virus.

FINDINGS
Of the male and female children, 96.3% and 98.2%, respectively had anti-HAV antibodies in their sera.
The prevalence of these antibodies in the age groups 10-12, 13- 14, and 15-17 years were 98.6%, 94.8%, and 98.3% respectively.
The frequency of HAV- induced acute viral hepatitis (69/870, 8%) in adults did not show an increasing trend.

CONCLUSION
Mass HAV vaccination may be unnecessary in northern India because the seroprevalence of protective antibodies against HAV in schoolchildren aged over 10 years remains above 95% and there has been no apparent increase in HAV-induced acute viral hepatitis in adults.

Title
Measles vaccine effectiveness and risk factors for measles in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate vaccine effectiveness and to assess risk factors for measles in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

METHOD
A case-control study, involving 198 cases with 783 age-matched neighbourhood controls and 120 measles cases with 365 age-matched hospital controls, was conducted in 1995-96 in three large hospitals in Dhaka.

FINDINGS
Measles vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 80% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 60-90%) using neighbourhood controls; very similar results were obtained using hospital controls.
Visits to a health facility 7-21 days before onset of any symptoms were associated with increased risk of measles compared with neighbourhood (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 7.0, 95% CI = 4.2-11.6) or hospital (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.01-2.8) controls.
Cases were more likely than controls to come from a household where more than one child lived (adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5 versus neighbourhood controls; adjusted OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.02-3.0 versus hospital controls).

CONCLUSIONS
To improve measles control in urban Dhaka missed immunization opportunities must be reduced in all health care facilities by following WHO guidelines.
For measles elimination, more than one dose of vaccine would be required.

Title
Treatment uptake by individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum in rural Gambia, West Africa.

OBJECTIVE
To find out what proportion of Plasmodium falciparum infections are treated in rural Gambia.

METHODS
Subjects from four villages in the Gambia were followed over nine months through visits to village health workers.
Monthly cross-sectional malaria surveys measured the prevalence of P. falciparum infection.
Linked databases were searched for treatment requests.
Treated cases were individuals with parasitaemia who requested treatment during narrow or extended periods (14 or 28 days, respectively) before or after a positive blood film was obtained.

FINDINGS
Parasite prevalence peaked in November 1998, when 399/653 (61%) individuals had parasitaemia.
Parasite prevalence was highest throughout the study in children aged 5-10 years.
Although access to treatment was better than in most of sub-Saharan Africa, only 20% of infected individuals sought medical treatment up to 14 days before or after a positive blood film.
Within two months of a positive blood film, 199/726 (27%) individuals with parasitaemia requested treatment.
Despite easy access to health care, less than half (42%) of those with parasite densities consistent with malaria attacks (5000/µl) requested treatment.
High parasite density and infection during October-November were associated with more frequent treatment requests.
Self-treatment was infrequent in study villages: in 3/120 (2.5%) households antimalarial drugs had been used in the preceding malaria season.

CONCLUSION
Many P. falciparum infections may be untreated because of their subclinical nature.
Intermittent presumptive treatment may reduce morbidity and mortality.
It is likely that not all untreated infections were asymptomatic.
Qualitative research should explore barriers to treatment uptake, to allow educational interventions to be planned.

Title
Aerosolized measles and measles-rubella vaccines induce better measles antibody booster responses than injected vaccines: randomized trials in Mexican schoolchildren.

OBJECTIVE
To compare antibody responses and side-effects of aerosolized and injected measles vaccines after revaccination of children enrolling in elementary schools.

METHODS
Vaccines for measles (Edmonston-Zagreb) or measles-rubella (Edmonston-Zagreb with RA27/3) were given by aerosol or injection to four groups of children.
An additional group received Schwarz measles vaccine by injection.
These five groups received vaccines in usual standard titre doses.
A sixth group received only 1000 plaque-forming units of Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine by aerosol.
The groups were randomized by school.
Concentrations of neutralizing antibodies were determined in blood specimens taken at baseline and four months after vaccination from randomized subgroups (n = 28-31) of children in each group.

FINDINGS
After baseline antibody titres were controlled for, the frequencies of fourfold or greater increases in neutralizing antibodies did not differ significantly between the three groups that received vaccine by aerosol (range 52%-64%), but they were significantly higher than those for the three groups that received injected vaccine (range 4%-23%).
Mean increases in titres and post-vaccination geometric mean titres paralleled these findings.
Fewer side-effects were noted after aerosol than injection administration of vaccine.

CONCLUSION
Immunogenicity of measles vaccine when administered by aerosol is superior to that when the vaccine is given by injection.
This advantage persists with aerosolized doses less than or equal to one-fifth of usual injected doses.
The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of measles vaccination by aerosol should be further evaluated in mass campaigns.

Title
A public-private partnership for malaria control: lessons from the Malarone Donation Programme.

Abstract
In 1996, Glaxo Wellcome offered to donate up to a million treatment courses annually of Malarone, a new antimalarial, with a view to reducing the global burden of malaria.
The Malarone Donation Programme (MDP) was established the following year.
Eight pilot sites were selected in Kenya and Uganda to develop and evaluate an effective, locally sustainable donation strategy that ensured controlled and appropriate use of Malarone.
The pilot programme targeted individuals who had acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria that had not responded to first-line treatments with chloroquine or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
Of the 161 079 patients clinically diagnosed at the pilot sites as having malaria, 1101 (0.68%) met all the conditions for participation and received directly observed treatment with Malarone.
MDP had a positive effect at the pilot sites by improving the diagnosis and management of malaria.
However, the provision of Malarone as a second-line drug at the district hospital level was not an efficient and effective use of resources.
The number of deaths among children and adults ineligible for MDP at the pilot sites suggested that high priority should be given to meeting the challenges of malaria treatment at the community level.

Title
Surgical services for children in developing countries.

Abstract
There is growing evidence that childhood surgical conditions, especially injuries, are common in developing countries and that poor care results in significant numbers of deaths and cases of disability.
Unfortunately, however, surgical care is not considered an essential component of most child health programmes.
Strategies for improving paediatric surgical care should be evidence-based and cost-effective and should aim to benefit the largest possible number of children.
The most likely way of achieving policy change is to demonstrate that childhood surgical conditions are a significant public health problem.
For paediatric purposes, special attention should also be given to defining a cost-effective package of surgical services, improving surgical care at the community level, and strengthening surgical education.
Surgical care should be an essential component of child health programmes in developing countries.

Title
Rapid assessment method for prevalence and intensity of Loa loa infection.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the validity of observations on eye worm and Calabar swellings for the rapid assessment of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis at the community level.

METHOD
A total of 12 895 individuals over the age of 15 years living in 102 communities in Cameroon and Nigeria took part in the study.
A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants from whom finger-prick blood samples were collected and examined for Loa loa microfilariae.
Rapid assessments of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis were made on the basis of a history of eye worm or Calabar swellings.

FINDINGS
There was a strong correlation between the indices of the rapid assessment procedures and the parasitological indices of L. loa endemicity.
The rapid assessment indices were effective in diagnosing high-risk communities (sensitivity 94-100%; specificity 66-92%).
The highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (92%) were obtained with a rapid assessment procedure based on a history of eye worm lasting 1-7 days together with confirmation by the guided recognition of a photograph of adult L. loa in the eye.

CONCLUSION
Rapid assessment of the prevalence and intensity of loiasis at the community level can be achieved using a procedure based on the history of eye worm lasting 1-7 days together with confirmation by the guided recognition of a photograph of an adult L. loa in the eye.

Title
Effect of interpregnancy interval on risk of spontaneous preterm birth in Emirati* women, United Arab Emirates.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether a short interpregnancy interval is a risk factor for preterm birth in Emirati women, where there is a wide range of interpregnancy intervals and uniformity in potentially confounding factors.

METHODS
A case-control design based on medical records was used.
A case was defined as a healthy multiparous Emirati woman delivering a healthy singleton spontaneously before 37 weeks of gestation between 1997 and 2000, and a control was defined as the next eligible similar woman delivering after 37 weeks of gestation.
Women were excluded if there was no information available about their most recent previous pregnancy or if it had resulted in a multiple or preterm birth.
Data collected from charts and delivery room records were analysed using the STATA statistical package.
All variables found to be valid, stable and significant by univariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis.

FINDINGS
There were 128 cases who met the eligibility criteria; 128 controls were selected.
Short interpregnancy intervals were significantly associated with case status (P<0.05).
The multivariate adjusted odds ratios for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th quartiles of interpregnancy interval compared with the lowest-risk 3rd quartile were 8.2, 5.4, and 2.0 (95% confidence intervals: 3.5-19.2, 2.4-12.6, and 0.9- 4.5 respectively).

CONCLUSION
A short interpregnancy interval is a risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth in Emirati women.
The magnitude of the risk and the risk gradient between exposure quartiles suggest that the risk factor is causal and that its modification would reduce the risk of preterm birth.

Title
A global response to a global problem: the epidemic of overnutrition.

Abstract
It is estimated that by 2020 two-thirds of the global burden of disease will be attributable to chronic noncommunicable diseases, most of them strongly associated with diet.
The nutrition transition towards refined foods, foods of animal origin, and increased fats plays a major role in the current global epidemics of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, among other noncommunicable conditions.
Sedentary lifestyles and the use of tobacco are also significant risk factors.
The epidemics cannot be ended simply by encouraging people to reduce their risk factors and adopt healthier lifestyles, although such encouragement is undoubtedly beneficial if the targeted people can respond.
Unfortunately, increasingly obesogenic environments, reinforced by many of the cultural changes associated with globalization, make even the adoption of healthy lifestyles, especially by children and adolescents, more and more difficult.
The present paper examines some possible mechanisms for, and WHO's role in, the development of a coordinated global strategy on diet, physical activity and health.
The situation presents many countries with unmanageable costs.
At the same time there are often continuing problems of undernutrition.
A concerted multisectoral approach, involving the use of policy, education and trade mechanisms, is necessary to address these matters.

Title
International law, human rights and HIV/AIDS.

Abstract
This article explores the relevance of international human rights law in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic at national and international levels.
Public health advocates can use arguments based on this body of law to promote responses to HIV/AIDS that reflect sound public health principles and documented best practice.
Development assistance is increasingly linked to rights-based approaches, such as participatory processes, and strategic alliances between health professionals, organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, and affected communities.
Legal and human rights advocacy strategies are increasingly productive and necessary.

Title
Global governance, international health law and WHO: looking towards the future.

Abstract
The evolving domain of international health law encompasses increasingly diverse and complex concerns.
Commentators agree that health development in the twenty-first century is likely to expand the use of conventional international law to create a framework for coordination and cooperation among states in an increasingly interdependent world.
This article examines the forces and factors behind the emerging expansion of conventional international health law as an important tool for present and future multilateral cooperation.
It considers challenges to effective international health cooperation posed for intergovernmental organizations and other actors involved in lawmaking.
Although full consolidation of all aspects of future international health lawmaking under the auspices of a single international organization is unworkable and undesirable, the World Health Organization (WHO) should endeavour to serve as a coordinator, catalyst and, where appropriate, platform for future health law codification.
Such leadership by WHO could enhance coordination, coherence and implementation of international health law policy.

Title
Violence against women increases the risk of infant and child mortality: a case-referent study in Nicaragua.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the impact of violence against mothers on mortality risks for their offspring before 5 years of age in Nicaragua.

METHODS
From a demographic database covering a random sample of urban and rural households in León, Nicaragua, we identified all live births among women aged 15-49 years.
Cases were defined as those who had died before the age of 5 years, between January 1993 and June 1996.
For each case, two referents, matched for sex and age at death, were selected from the database.
A total of 110 mothers of the cases and 203 mothers of the referents were interviewed using a standard questionnaire covering mothers' experience of physical and sexual violence.
The data were analysed for the risk associated with maternal experience of violence of infant and under-5 mortality.

FINDINGS
A total of 61% of mothers of cases had a lifetime experience of physical and/or sexual violence compared with 37% of mothers of referents, with a significant association being found between such experiences and mortality among their offspring.
Other factors associated with higher infant and under-5 mortality were mother's education (no formal education), age (older), and parity (multiparity).

CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest an association between physical and sexual violence against mothers, either before or during pregnancy, and an increased risk of under-5 mortality of their offspring.
The type and severity of violence was probably more relevant to the risk than the timing, and violence may impact child health through maternal stress or care-giving behaviours rather than through direct trauma itself.

Title
Prevalence of goitre and urinary iodine status of primary-school children in Lesotho.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the prevalence of goitre, urinary iodine status, coverage of supplementation of iodized oil capsules, and current use of iodized salt in children in Lesotho.

METHODS
Cross-sectional study of children from 50 primary schools in Lesotho.
Thyroid glands of children aged 8-12 years were measured by palpation and graded according to the WHO, UNICEF, and the International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency's (ICCIDD) joint criteria.
The use of iodized oil capsules was determined by a structured questionnaire and verified with the children's health booklets.
Iodine content of household salt samples was analysed.
Casual urine samples were analysed for urinary iodine.

FINDINGS
Median urinary iodine concentrations of 26.3 µg/l (range 22.3-47.9 µg/l) indicated moderate iodine deficiency.
More children in the mountains than in the lowlands were severely iodine deficient (17.7% vs 1.9%).
Adjusted prevalence of goitre (4.9%) increased with age, was higher in girls than boys, and ranged from 2.2% to 8.8% in the different districts; this indicated no public health problem.
Overall, 94.4% of salt samples were iodized, and coverage of supplementation with iodized oil capsules was 55.1%.

CONCLUSION
Mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency exists in Lesotho.
Iodine deficiency was more severe in the mountains than the lowlands and is still a concern for public health.
Use of iodized salt coupled with iodized oil supplementation effectively controls iodine deficiency disorders.
Effective monitoring programmes would ensure the use of adequately iodized salt throughout Lesotho and serve to evaluate progress towards optimal iodine nutrition.
Iodized oil capsule supplementation should continue in the mountains.

Title
Healthy life expectancy in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.

Abstract
Sullivan's method and a regression model were used to calculate healthy life expectancy (HALE) for men and women in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) of China.
These methods need estimates of the prevalence and information on disability distributions of 109 diseases and HALE for 191 countries by age, sex and region of the world from the WHO's health assessment of 2000.
The population of Hong Kong SAR has one of the highest healthy life expectancies in the world.
Sullivan's method gives higher estimates than the classic linear regression method.
Although Sullivan's method accurately calculates the influence of disease prevalence within small areas and regions, the regression method can approximate HALE for all economies for which information on life expectancy is available.
This paper identifies some problems of the two methods and discusses the accuracy of estimates of HALE that rely on data from the WHO assessment.

Title
Immunization of children at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus.

Abstract
This paper reviews the English language literature on the safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of vaccines currently recommended by WHO for use in national immunization programmes.
Immunization is generally safe and beneficial for children infected with HIV, although HIV-induced immune suppression reduces the benefit compared with that obtained in HIV-uninfected children.
However, serious complications can occur following immunization of severely immunocompromised children with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.
The risk of serious complications attributable to yellow fever vaccine in HIV-infected persons has not been determined.
WHO guidelines for immunizing children with HIV infection and infants born to HIV-infected women differ only slightly from the general guidelines.
BCG and yellow fever vaccines should be withheld from symptomatic HIV-infected children.
Only one serious complication (fatal pneumonia) has been attributed to measles vaccine administered to a severely immunocompromised adult.
Although two HIV-infected infants have developed vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis, several million infected children have been vaccinated and the evidence does not suggest that there is an increased risk.
The benefits of measles and poliovirus vaccines far outweigh the potential risks in HIV-infected children.
The policy of administering routine vaccines to all children, regardless of possible HIV exposure, has been very effective in obtaining high immunization coverage and control of preventable diseases.
Any changes in this policy would have to be carefully examined for a potential negative impact on disease control programmes in many countries.

Title
Community-based monitoring of safe motherhood in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the progress made towards the Safe Motherhood Initiative goals in three areas of the United Republic of Tanzania during the 1990s.

METHODS
Maternal mortality in the United Republic of Tanzania was monitored by sentinel demographic surveillance of more than 77 000 women of reproductive age, and by prospective monitoring of mortality in the following locations: an urban site; a wealthier rural district; and a poor rural district.
The observation period for the rural districts was 1992-99 and 1993-99 for the urban site.

FINDINGS
During the period of observation, the proportion of deaths of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) due to maternal causes (PMDF) compared with all causes was between 0.063 and 0.095.
Maternal mortality ratios (MMRatios) were 591-1099 and maternal mortality rates (MMRates; maternal deaths per 100 000 women aged 15-49 years) were 43.1-123.0.
MMRatios in surveillance areas were substantially higher than estimates from official, facility-based statistics.
In all areas, the MMRates in 1999 were substantially lower than at the start of surveillance (1992 for rural districts, 1993 for the urban area), although trends during the period were statistically significant at the 90% level only in the urban site.
At the community level, an additional year of education for household heads was associated with a 62% lower maternal death rate, after controlling for community-level variables such as the proportion of home births and occupational class.

CONCLUSION
Educational level was a major predictor of declining MMRates.
Even though rates may be decreasing, they remained high in the study areas.
The use of sentinel registration areas may be a cost-effective and accurate way for developing countries to monitor mortality indicators and causes, including for maternal mortality.

Title
Household willingness to pay for azithromycin treatment for trachoma control in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
Household willingness to pay for treatment provides important information for programme planning.
We tested for relationships between socioeconomic status, risk of trachoma, perceptions of the effects of azithromycin, and the household willingness to pay for future mass treatment with azithromycin.

METHODS
We surveyed 394 households in 6 villages located in central United Republic of Tanzania regarding their willingness to pay for future azithromycin treatment.
A random sample of households with children under 8 years of age was selected and interviewed following an initial treatment programme in each village.
Data were gathered on risk factors for trachoma, socioeconomic status, and the perceived effect of the initial azithromycin treatment.
Ordered probit regression analysis was used to test for statistically significant relationships.

FINDINGS
38% of responding households stated that they would not be willing to pay anything for future azithromycin treatment, although they would be willing to participate in the treatment.
A proxy for cash availability was positively associated with household willingness to pay for future antibiotic treatment.
Cattle ownership (a risk factor) and being a household headed by a female not in a polygamous marriage (lower socioeconomic status) were associated with a lower willingness to pay for future treatment.
A perceived benefit from the initial treatment was marginally associated with a willingness to pay a higher amount.

CONCLUSIONS
As those at greatest risk of active trachoma indicated the lowest willingness to pay, imposing a cost recovery fee for azithromycin treatment would likely reduce coverage and could prevent control of the disease at the community level.

Title
Quality and comparison of antenatal care in public and private providers in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the quality of public and private first-tier antenatal care services in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, using defined criteria.

METHODS
Structural attributes of quality were assessed through a checklist, and process attributes, including interpersonal and technical aspects, through observation and exit interviews.
A total of 16 health care providers, and 166 women in the public and 188 in the private sector, were selected by systematic random sampling for inclusion in the study.
Quality was measured against national standards, and an overall score calculated for the different aspects to permit comparison.

FINDINGS
The results showed that both public and private providers were reasonably good with regard to the structural and interpersonal aspects of quality of care.
However, both were poor when it came to technical aspects of quality.
For example, guidelines for dispensing prophylactic drugs against anaemia or malaria were not respected, and diagnostic examinations for the assessment of gestation, anaemia, malaria or urine infection were frequently not performed.
In all aspects, private providers were significantly better than public ones.

CONCLUSION
Approaches to improving quality of care should emerge progressively as a result of regular quality assessments.
Changes should be introduced using an incremental approach addressing few improvements at a time, while ensuring participation in, and ownership of, every aspect of the strategy by health personnel, health planners and managers and also the community.

Title
Evaluation of a water, sanitation, and hygiene education intervention on diarrhoea in northern Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE
Inadequate water and sanitation services adversely affect the health and socioeconomic development of communities.
The Water and Sanitation Extension Programme (WASEP) project, undertaken in selected villages in northern Pakistan between 1997 and 2001, was designed to deliver an integrated package of activities to improve potable water supply at village and household levels, sanitation facilities and their use, and awareness and practices about hygiene behaviour.

METHODS
A case-control study was conducted during July-September 2001 to evaluate whether, after selected confounders were controlled for, children aged <6 years with diarrhoea were more or less likely to reside in villages that participated in the project than in villages that did not participate.
Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed.

FINDINGS
Children not living in WASEP villages had a 33% higher adjusted odds ratio for having diarrhoea than children living in WASEP villages (adjusted odds ratio, 1.331; P<0.049).
Boys had 25% lower odds of having diarrhoea than girls (adjusted odds ratio, 0.748; P<0.049).
A 2.6% decrease was found in the odds of diarrhoea for every yearly increase in the mother's age (adjusted odds ratio, 0.974; P<0.044) and a 1.4% decrease for every monthly increase in the child's age (adjusted odds ratio, 0.986; P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS
The findings in this study may help refine the approach to future water, sanitation, and hygiene initiatives in northern Pakistan.
The integrated approach taken by WASEP, which incorporates engineering solutions with appropriate education to maximize facility usage and improve hygiene practices, is a useful example of how desired health benefits can be obtained from projects of this type.

Title
Implementation and quantitative evaluation of chronic disease self-management programme in Shanghai, China: randomized controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effectiveness of the Shanghai Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP).

METHODS
A randomized controlled trial with six-month follow-up compared patients who received treatment with those who did not receive treatment (waiting-list controls) in five urban communities in Shanghai, China.
Participants in the treatment group received education from a lay-led CDSMP course and one copy of a help book immediately; those in the control group received the same education and book six months later.

FINDINGS
In total, 954 volunteer patients with a medical record that confirmed a diagnosis of hypertension, heart disease, chronic lung disease, arthritis, stroke, or diabetes who lived in communities were assigned randomly to treatment (n = 526) and control (n = 428) groups.
Overall, 430 (81.7%) and 349 (81.5%) patients in the treatment and control groups completed the six-month study.
Patients who received treatment had significant improvements in weekly minutes of aerobic exercise, practice of cognitive symptom management, self-efficacy to manage own symptoms, and self-efficacy to manage own disease in general compared with controls.
They also had significant improvements in eight indices of health status and, on average, fewer hospitalizations.

CONCLUSION
When implemented in Shanghai, the CDSMP was acceptable culturally to Chinese patients.
The programme improved participants' health behaviour, self-efficacy, and health status and reduced the number of hospitalizations six months after the course.
The locally based delivery model was integrated into the routine of community government organizations and community health services.
Chinese lay leaders taught the CDSMP courses as successfully as professionals.

Title
Efficacy of oxamniquine and praziquantel in the treatment of Schistosoma mansoni infection: a controlled trial.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oxamniquine and praziquantel, the two most clinically important schistosomicide drugs, and to compare the accuracy of faecal examination with the accuracy of oogram in testing for Schistosoma mansoni infection.

METHODS
In a triple-masked and randomized controlled trial, 106 patients infected with S. mansoni were randomly allocated to one of three statistically homogeneous groups.
One group was given 60 mg/kg praziquantel per day for three consecutive days, another was given two daily doses of 10 mg/kg oxamniquine, and the placebo group received starch.
Faecal examinations (days 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 after treatment) and biopsy of rectal mucosa by quantitative oogram (days 30, 60, 120, and 180) were used for the initial diagnosis and for evaluating the degree of cure.
The c2 test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare variables in the three groups.
Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) and the log-rank test were used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments.

FINDINGS
The sensitivity of stool examinations ranged from 88.9% to 94.4% when patients presented with >5000 S. mansoni eggs per gram of tissue (oogram); when the number of eggs dropped to <1000 eggs per gram, sensitivity was reduced (range, 22.7-34.0%).
When cure was evaluated by stool examination, oxamniquine and praziquantel had cure rates of 90.3% and 100%, respectively.
However, when the oogram was used as an indicator of sensitivity, the oxamniquine cure rate dropped dramatically (to 42.4%), whereas the rate for praziquantel remained high, at 96.1%.

CONCLUSIONS
Praziquantel was significantly more effective than oxamniquine in treating S. mansoni infection.
The oogram was markedly more sensitive than stool examinations in detecting S. mansoni eggs and should be recommended for use in clinical trials with schistosomicides.

Title
Analysis of the effects of malaria chemoprophylaxis in children on haematological responses, morbidity and mortality.

Abstract
This paper reviews the evidence for beneficial effects of malaria chemoprophylaxis on haematological responses, morbidity, mortality, health service utilization and rebound immunity in children.
As anaemia may play an important role in childhood mortality, it is important to assess evidence from controlled trials of the potential of chemoprophylaxis to reduce childhood anaemia.
An analysis of trials found good evidence that malaria chemoprophylaxis improves mean haemoglobin levels and reduces severe anaemia, clinical malaria attacks, parasite and spleen rates.
Significant reductions in outpatient attendance and hospital admissions have been achieved, and substantial evidence from Gambian studies shows reductions in mortality.
Chemoprophylaxis in children does not seem to produce any sustained impairment of immunity to malaria, although rebound effects may be greater in children who receive prophylaxis during infancy.
Short periods of targeted prophylaxis are likely to be preferable to continuous drug administration.
Evidence of the protective efficacy of malaria chemoprophylaxis in children shows that this strategy could be considered within integrated health programmes for specific time periods.
Intermittent routine combination therapy early in childhood may be appropriate for those living under holoendemic conditions.
Large-scale studies over a number of years are needed to address this issue and the impact of this approach on health service utilization, mortality, and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites.

Title
Implementation of WHO guidelines on management of severe malnutrition in hospitals in Africa.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the problems, benefits, feasibility, and sustainability of implementation of WHO guidelines on management of severe malnutrition.

METHODS
A postal survey invited staff from 12 African hospitals to participate in the study.
Five hospitals were evaluated and two were selected to take part in the study: a district hospital in South Africa and a mission hospital in Ghana.
At an initial visit, an experienced paediatrician reviewed the situation in the hospitals and introduced the principles of the guidelines through a participatory approach.
During a second visit about six months later, the paediatrician reviewed the feasibility and sustainability of the introduced changes and helped find solutions to problems.
At a final visit after one year, the paediatrician reassessed the overall situation.

FINDINGS
Malnutrition management practices improved at both hospitals.
Measures against hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, and infection were strengthened.
Early, frequent feeding was established as a routine practice.
Some micronutrients for inclusion in the diet were not locally available and needed to be imported.
Problems were encountered with monitoring of weight gain and introducing a rehydration solution for malnutrition.

CONCLUSION
Implementation of the main principles of the WHO guidelines on severe malnutrition was feasible, affordable, and sustainable at two African hospitals.
The guidelines could be improved by including suggestions on how to adapt specific recommendations to local situations.
The guidelines are well supported by experience and published reports, but more information is needed about some components and their impact on mortality.

Title
Transgenic mice as an alternative to monkeys for neurovirulence testing of live oral poliovirus vaccine: validation by a WHO collaborative study.

OBJECTIVE
Extensive WHO collaborative studies were performed to evaluate the suitability of transgenic mice susceptible to poliovirus (TgPVR mice, strain 21, bred and provided by the Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Japan) as an alternative to monkeys in the neurovirulence test (NVT) of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).

METHODS
Nine laboratories participated in the collaborative study on testing neurovirulence of 94 preparations of OPV and vaccine derivatives of all three serotypes in TgPVR21 mice.

FINDINGS
Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that the TgPVR21 mouse NVT was of comparable sensitivity and reproducibility to the conventional WHO NVT in simians.
A statistical model for acceptance/rejection of OPV lots in the mouse test was developed, validated, and shown to be suitable for all three vaccine types.
The assessment of the transgenic mouse NVT is based on clinical evaluation of paralysed mice.
Unlike the monkey NVT, histological examination of central nervous system tissue of each mouse offered no advantage over careful and detailed clinical observation.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on data from the collaborative studies the WHO Expert Committee for Biological Standardization approved the mouse NVT as an alternative to the monkey test for all three OPV types and defined a standard implementation process for laboratories that wish to use the test.
This represents the first successful introduction of transgenic animals into control of biologicals.

Title
Cost-effectiveness of social marketing of insecticide-treated nets for malaria control in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the costs and consequences of a social marketing approach to malaria control in children by means of insecticide-treated nets in two rural districts of the United Republic of Tanzania, compared with no net use.

METHODS
Project cost data were collected prospectively from accounting records.
Community effectiveness was estimated on the basis of a nested case-control study and a cross-sectional cluster sample survey.

FINDINGS
The social marketing approach to the distribution of insecticide-treated nets was estimated to cost US$ 1560 per death averted and US$ 57 per disability-adjusted life year averted.
These figures fell to US$ 1018 and US$ 37, respectively, when the costs and consequences of untreated nets were taken into account.

CONCLUSION
The social marketing of insecticide-treated nets is an attractive intervention for preventing childhood deaths from malaria.

Title
International survey on variations in practice of the management of the third stage of labour.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the use of the active management of the third stage of labour in 15 university-based obstetric centres in ten developing and developed countries and to determine whether evidence-based practices were being used.

METHODS
From March 1999 to December 1999, the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (GNPRH) conducted an observational, cross-sectional survey to assess the use of the practice and its components.
Prospective data on patient characteristics and the interventions used in the management of the third stage of labour were collected using standardized methods.
Data on approximately 30 consecutive vaginal deliveries in each centre (452 in total) were included.

FINDINGS
Significant intracountry and intercountry variation in the practice of the active management of the third stage of labour was found (111/452 deliveries used active management), which confirmed the existence of a large gap between knowledge and practice.

CONCLUSION
Areas identified for improvement are the urgent implementation of the evidence-based clinical management practice defined as the active management of the third stage of labour; increased accessibility to systematic reviews in developing countries; and the conduction of clinical trials that assess the impact of this intervention in other settings.

Title
A rapid assessment approach for public health decision-making related to the prevention of malaria during pregnancy.

Objective
To develop a rapid field assessment methodology to address the burden of malaria during pregnancy and the options for intervening within the existing antenatal care system in Kenya.

Methods
Surveys consisting of questionnaires, sampling of blood for parasitaemia and anaemia, and birth outcome assessment were conducted in antenatal clinics, delivery units, and in the community in Kisumu and Mombasa, Kenya.

Findings
The rates of maternal anaemia and severe anaemia, were, respectively, 79% and 8% in Kisumu, and 95% and 24% in Mombasa.
The rates of placental parasitaemia were 27% and 24% and the rates of low birth weight were 18% and 24% in Kisumu and Mombasa, respectively.
Women with placental parasitaemia had a higher incidence of low birth weight compared with women without placental parasitaemia in both Kisumu (28% vs 16%, P=0.004) and Mombasa (42% vs 20%, P=0.004).
A total of 95% and 98% of women in Kisumu and Mombasa, respectively, reported attending an antenatal clinic during their previous pregnancy.

Conclusion
This methodology can be used by ministries of health to collect data for decision-making regarding malaria control during pregnancy; it can also provide a baseline measurement on which to evaluate subsequent interventions.

Title
Efficacy of mebendazole and levamisole alone or in combination against intestinal nematode infections after repeated targeted mebendazole treatment in Zanzibar.

Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of and resistance to mebendazole (500 mg) and levamisole (40 or 80 mg), alone or in combination, for the treatment of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm infections on Pemba Island - an area exposed to periodic school-based mebendazole treatment since 1994.

Methods
A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out in 914 children enrolled from the first and fifth grades of primary schools.
Stool samples collected at baseline and 21 days after treatment were examined by the Kato-Katz technique to assess the prevalence and intensity of helminth infection.

Findings
Efficacies of mebendazole and levamisole as single treatments against intestinal nematode infections were comparable with those in previous trials, but mebendazole treatment of hookworm infections gave significantly lower cure (7.6%) and egg reduction (52.1%) rates than reported in a study undertaken before the beginning of periodic chemotherapy (cure rate, 22.4%; egg reduction rate, 82.4%).
Combined treatment with mebendazole and levamisole had a significantly higher efficacy against hookworm infections (cure rate, 26.1%; egg reduction rate, 88.7%) than either drug given alone.
No difference in mebendazole efficacy was found in children who had been treated repeatedly compared with those who had not been treated previously.

Conclusion
The overall efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm infections after periodic chemotherapy is reduced.
The efficacy of benzimidazoles in chemotherapy-based control programmes should be monitored closely.
Combined treatment with mebendazole and levamisole may be useful as a tool to delay the development of benzimidazole resistance.

Title
Maternal psychosocial well-being in Eritrea: application of participatory methods and tools of investigation and analysis in complex emergency settings.

Objective
To establish the context in which maternal psychosocial well-being is understood in war-affected settings in Eritrea.

Method
Pretested and validated participatory methods and tools of investigation and analysis were employed to allow participants to engage in processes of qualitative data collection, on-site analysis, and interpretation.

Findings
Maternal psychosocial well-being in Eritrea is maintained primarily by traditional systems of social support that are mostly outside the domain of statutory primary care.
Traditional birth attendants provide a vital link between the two.
Formal training and regular supplies of sterile delivery kits appear to be worthwhile options for health policy and practice in the face of the post-conflict challenges of ruined infrastructure and an overstretched and/or ill-mannered workforce in the maternity health service.

Conclusion
Methodological advances in health research and the dearth of data on maternal psychosocial well-being in complex emergency settings call for scholars and practitioners to collaborate in creative searches for sound evidence on which to base maternity, mental health and social care policy and practice.
Participatory methods facilitate the meaningful engagement of key stakeholders and enhance data quality, reliability and usability.

Title
Health impact assessment of agriculture and food policies: lessons learnt from the Republic of Slovenia.

Abstract
The most important public health priority in agricultural policy-making is currently food safety, despite the relatively higher importance of food security, nutrition, and other agricultural-related health issues in terms of global burden of disease.
There is limited experience worldwide of using health impact assessment (HIA) during the development of agriculture and food policies, which perhaps reflects the complex nature of this policy sector.
This paper presents methods of HIA used in the Republic of Slovenia, which is conducting a HIA of proposed agricultural and food policies due to its accession to the European Union.
It is the first time that any government has attempted to assess the health effects of agricultural policy at a national level.
The HIA has basically followed a six-stage process: policy analysis; rapid appraisal workshops with stakeholders from a range of backgrounds; review of research evidence relevant to the agricultural policy; analysis of Slovenian data for key health-related indicators; a report on the findings to a key cross-government group; and evaluation.
The experience in Slovenia shows that the HIA process has been a useful mechanism for raising broader public health issues on the agricultural policy agenda, and it has already had positive results for policy formation.
HIA is one useful approach to more integrated policy-making across sectors, but clearly it is not the only mechanism to achieve this.
A comparison of the approach used in Slovenia with HIA methods in other countries and policy contexts shows that there are still many limitations with HIA application at a government level.
Lessons can be learnt from these case studies for future development and application of HIA that is more relevant to policy-makers, and assists them in making more healthy policy choices.

Title
Soft data, hard effects. Strategies for effective policy on health impact assessment: an example from the Netherlands.

Abstract
Health impact assessment (HIA) on a strategic level focuses on the broad determinants of health.
However, the evidence with regard to the health impacts is often necessarily "soft".
The example of a health impact review on national housing policy in the Netherlands shows that HIA can be effective even in the absence of hard data.
Strategies used to overcome the problem of not having hard data are outlined.
The authors argue that, for HIA to be effective, it does not necessarily have to be limited to easy-to-measure, easy-to-quantify programmes and health effects.

Title
Integrated environmental impact assessment: a Canadian example.

Abstract
The Canadian federal process for environmental impact assessment (EIA) integrates health, social, and environmental aspects into either a screening, comprehensive study, or a review by a public panel, depending on the expected severity of potential adverse environmental effects.
In this example, a Public Review Panel considered a proposed diamond mining project in Canada's northern territories, where 50% of the population are Aboriginals.
The Panel specifically instructed the project proposer to determine how to incorporate traditional knowledge into the gathering of baseline information, preparing impact prediction, and planning mitigation and monitoring.
Traditional knowledge is defined as the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and/or local communities developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to local culture and environment.
The mining company was asked to consider in its EIA: health, demographics, social and cultural patterns; services and infrastructure; local, regional and territorial economy; land and resource use; employment, education and training; government; and other matters.
Cooperative efforts between government, industry and the community led to a project that coordinated the concerns of all interested stakeholders and the needs of present and future generations, thereby meeting the goals of sustainable development.
The mitigation measures that were implemented take into account: income and social status, social support networks, education, employment and working conditions, physical environments, personal health practices and coping skills, and health services.

Title
Comparative assessment of transport risks: how it can contribute to health impact assessment of transport policies.

Abstract
Health impact assessment (HIA) and comparative risk assessment (CRA) are important tools with which governments and communities can compare and integrate different sources of information about various health impacts into a single framework for policy-makers and planners.
Both tools have strengths that may be combined usefully when conducting comprehensive assessments of decisions that affect complex health issues, such as the health risks and impacts of transport policy and planning activities.
As yet, however, HIA and CRA have not been applied widely to the area of transport.
We draw on the limited experience of the application of these tools in the context of road transport to explore how comparative assessment of transport risks can contribute to HIA of transport policies.

Title
Prediction of community prevalence of human onchocerciasis in the Amazonian onchocerciasis focus: Bayesian approach.

OBJECTIVE
To develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for human onchocerciasis with which to explore the factors that influence prevalence of microfilariae in the Amazonian focus of onchocerciasis and predict the probability of any community being at least mesoendemic (>20% prevalence of microfilariae), and thus in need of priority ivermectin treatment.

METHODS
Models were developed with data from 732 individuals aged >15 years who lived in 29 Yanomami communities along four rivers of the south Venezuelan Orinoco basin.
The models' abilities to predict prevalences of microfilariae in communities were compared.
The deviance information criterion, Bayesian P-values, and residual values were used to select the best model with an approximate cross-validation procedure.

FINDINGS
A three-level model that acknowledged clustering of infection within communities performed best, with host age and sex included at the individual level, a river-dependent altitude effect at the community level, and additional clustering of communities along rivers.
This model correctly classified 25/29 (86%) villages with respect to their need for priority ivermectin treatment.

CONCLUSION
Bayesian methods are a flexible and useful approach for public health research and control planning.
Our model acknowledges the clustering of infection within communities, allows investigation of links between individual- or community-specific characteristics and infection, incorporates additional uncertainty due to missing covariate data, and informs policy decisions by predicting the probability that a new community is at least mesoendemic.

Title
Understanding women's attitudes towards wife beating in Zimbabwe.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the factors associated with attitudes towards wife beating among women in partnerships in Zimbabwe in order to assist public health practitioners in preventing intimate partner violence (IPV).

METHODS
A nationally representative survey of 5907 women of reproductive age (15-49 years) was conducted in Zimbabwe.
Women were asked about their attitudes towards wife beating in five situations.
The survey included sociodemographic characteristics, partnership characteristics, and household decision-making.

FINDINGS
Over half of all women in Zimbabwe (53%) believed that wife beating was justified in at least one of the five situations.
Respondents were most likely to find wife beating justified if a wife argued with her spouse (36%), neglected her children (33%), or went out without telling her spouse (30%).
Among women in partnerships (n = 3077), younger age, living in rural areas, lower household wealth, schooling at a lower level than secondary, and lower occupational status were associated with women reporting that wife beating is justified.
Women who reported that they make household decisions jointly with their partners were less likely to say that wife beating is justified.

CONCLUSIONS
Zimbabwe has a long way to go in preventing IPV, particularly because the younger generation of women is significantly more likely to believe that wife beating is justified compared with older women.
Given the current social and political climate in Zimbabwe, finding means to negotiate rather than settle conflict through violence is essential from the household level to the national level.

Title
Assessment of the iodine concentration in table salt at the production stage in South Africa.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the iodine content of iodized salt at the production stage, to assess the perceptions and knowledge of salt producers about the prevention and control of iodine deficiency, and to examine the internal quality control procedures used during iodization in South Africa.

METHOD
Salt samples were collected for iodine analysis by titration from the 12 producers iodizing salt in South Africa.
Information on the producers' knowledge of iodine deficiency disorders and on internal quality control was obtained by means of questionnaires.

FINDINGS
The legal requirement of 40-60 ppm iodine was met in 30.9% of salt samples; 57.9% contained more than 30 ppm iodine; 34.8% contained under 20 ppm iodine.
There were shortcomings in perceptions and knowledge about iodine deficiency disorders and in the internal quality control procedures of a substantial proportion of the producers.

CONCLUSION
In order to encourage and support salt producers to achieve optimal iodization there should be an information, education and communication strategy aimed at improving knowledge of iodine deficiency disorders and at raising the standard of internal quality control procedures.
External monitoring should continue.

Title
Fees-for-services, cost recovery, and equity in a district of Burkina Faso operating the Bamako Initiative.

OBJECTIVE
To gauge the effects of operating the Bamako Initiative in Kongoussi district, Burkina Faso.

METHODS
Qualitative and quasi-experimental quantitative methodologies were used.

FINDINGS
Following the introduction of fees-for-services in July 1997, the number of consultations for curative care fell over a period of three years by an average of 15.4% at "case" health centres but increased by 30.5% at "control" health centres.
Moreover, although the operational results for essential drugs depots were not known, expenditure increased on average 2.7 times more than income and did not keep pace with the decline in the utilization of services.
Persons in charge of the management committees had difficulties in releasing funds to ensure access to care for the poor.

CONCLUSION
The introduction of fees-for-services had an adverse effect on service utilization.
The study district is in a position to bear the financial cost of taking care of the poor and the community is able to identify such people.
Incentives must be introduced by the state and be swiftly applied so that the communities agree to a more equitable system and thereby allow access to care for those excluded from services because they are unable to pay.

Title
Introducing auto-disable syringes to the national immunization programme in Madagascar.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the safety and coverage benefits of auto-disable (AD) syringes, weighed against the financial and logis- tical costs, and to create appropriate health policies in Madagascar.

METHODS
Fifteen clinics in Madagascar, trained to use AD syringes, were randomized to implement an AD syringe only, mixed (AD syringes used only on non-routine immunization days), or sterilizable syringe only (control) programme.
During a five-week period, data on administered vaccinations were collected, interviews were conducted, and observations were recorded.

FINDINGS
The use of AD syringes improved coverage rates by significantly increasing the percentage of vaccines administered on non-routine immunization days (AD-only 4.3%, mixed 5.7%, control 1.1% (P<0.05)).
AD-only clinics eliminated sterilization sessions for vaccinations, whereas mixed clinics reduced the number of sterilization sessions by 64%.
AD syringes were five times more expensive than sterilizable syringes, which increased AD-only and mixed clinics’ projected annual injection costs by 365% and 22%, respectively.
However, introducing AD syringes for all vaccinations would only increase the national immunization budget by 2%.

CONCLUSION
The use of AD syringes improved vaccination coverage rates by providing ready-to-use sterile syringes on non-routine immunization days and decreasing the number of sterilization sessions, thereby improving injection safety.
The mixed programme was the most beneficial approach to phasing in AD syringes and diminishing logistical complications, and it had minimal costs.
AD syringes, although more expensive, can feasibly be introduced into a developing country’s immunization programme to improve vaccination safety and coverage.

Title
Changes in morbidity and medical care utilization after the recent economic crisis in the Republic of Korea.

OBJECTIVE
To examine and quantify the impact of the recent economic crisis on morbidity and medical care utilization in the Republic of Korea.

METHODS
22 675 people from 6791 households and 43 682 people from 12 283 households were questioned for two nationwide surveys that took place in 1995 and 1998, respectively.
A separate sample pretest-posttest design was used and we conducted c2 test and logistic regression analysis after controlling for the maturation effect of the morbidity and medical care utilization.

FINDINGS
The morbidity rates of chronic disease and acute disease increased significantly by 27.1% and 9.5%, respectively, whereas the utilization rates of outpatient and inpatient services decreased by 15.1% and 5.2%, respectively.
In particular, the pace of decline in the utilization rate of outpatient services varied depending on the type of disease: morbidity rates for mental and behavioural disorders were 13.7%; for cardiovascular disease, 7.1%; and for injury, 31.6%.

CONCLUSION
After the Republic of Korean economic crisis, the morbidity and medical care utilization rates changed significantly but the degree of change depended on the type of disease or service.
The time-dependent relationship between the national economy and the morbidity and medical care utilization rates needs to be further investigated.

Title
Promoting safe motherhood through the private sector in low- and middle-income countries.

Abstract
The formal private sector could play a significant role in determining whether success or failure is achieved in working towards goals for safe motherhood in many low- and middle-income settings.
Established private providers, especially nurses/midwives, have the potential to contribute to safe motherhood practices if they are involved in the care continuum.
However, they have largely been overlooked by policy-makers in low-income settings.
The private sector (mainly doctors) contributes to overprovision and high Caesarean section rates in settings where it provides care to wealthier segments of the population; such care is often funded through third-party payment schemes.
In poorer settings, especially rural areas, private nurses/midwives and the women who choose to use them are likely to experience similar constraints to those encountered in the public sector - for example, poor or unaffordable access to higher level facilities for the management of obstetrical emergencies.
Policy-makers at the country-level need to map the health system and understand the nature and distribution of the private sector, and what influences it.
This potential resource could then be mobilized to work towards the achievement of safe motherhood goals.

Title
New approaches to pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis.

Abstract
Osteoporosis has been recognized as a major public health problem for less than two decades.
The increasing incidence of fragility fractures, such as vertebral, hip, and wrist fractures, first became apparent from epidemiological studies in the early and mid-1980s, when effective treatment was virtually unavailable.
Pharmacological therapies that effectively reduce the number of fractures by improving bone mass are now available widely in countries around the world.
Most current agents inhibit bone loss by reducing bone resorption, but emerging therapies may increase bone mass by directly promoting bone formation - as is the case with parathyroid hormone.
Current treatment alternatives include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, but sufficient calcium and vitamin D are a prerequisite.
The availability of evidence-based data that show reductions in the incidence of fractures of 30-50% during treatment has been a major step forward in the pharmacological prevention of fractures.
With all agents, fracture reduction is most pronounced for vertebral fracture in high-risk individuals; alendronate and risedronate also may protect against hip fracture in the elderly.
New approaches to pharmacological treatment will include further development of existing drugs, especially with regard to tolerance and frequency of dosing.
New avenues for targeting the condition will emerge as our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of bone remodelling increases, although issues of tissue specificity may be difficult to solve.
In the long term, information gained through knowledge of bone genetics may be used to adapt pharmacological treatments more precisely to each individual.

Title
Improved education in musculoskeletal conditions is necessary for all doctors.

Abstract
It is likely that everyone will, at some time, suffer from a problem related to the musculoskeletal system, ranging from a very common problem such as osteoarthritis or back pain to severely disabling limb trauma or rheumatoid arthritis.
Many musculoskeletal problems are chronic conditions.
The most common symptoms are pain and disability, with an impact not only on individuals' quality of life but also, importantly, on people's ability to earn a living and be independent.
It has been estimated that one in four consultations in primary care is caused by problems of the musculoskeletal system and that these conditions may account for up to 60% of all disability pensions.
In contrast, teaching at undergraduate and graduate levels - and the resulting competence and confidence of many doctors - do not reflect the impact of these conditions on individuals and society.
Many medical students do not have any clinical training in assessing patients with bone and joint problems.
Under the umbrella of the Bone and Joint Decade 2000-2010, experts from all parts of the world with an interest in teaching have developed recommendations for an undergraduate curriculum to improve the teaching of musculoskeletal conditions in medical schools.
The goal for each medical school should be a course in musculoskeletal medicine concentrating on clinical assessment, common outpatient musculoskeletal problems and recognition of emergencies.
Improving competency in the management of musculoskeletal problems within primary care settings through improved education is the next aim, but there are needs for improvement for all professionals and at all levels within the health care system.

Title
Single-dose versus multi-dose vaccine vials for immunization programmes in developing countries.

Abstract
Excessive vaccine wastage and safety concerns have prompted the international health community to develop and supply vaccines in formats other than the standard multi-dose vial.
This article presents a programmatic and economic comparison of the major differences between the multi-dose vials and single-dose formats used for immunization services in developing countries.
Multi-dose vials, in general, sell at a lower per-dose price and occupy less cold-chain capacity than single-dose formats.
However, higher wastage rates may offset these benefits, especially for more expensive vaccines.
Singledose formats offer several important programmatic benefits, such as increased vaccination opportunities and improved vaccine safety.
One single-dose format, the prefilled auto-disable (AD) device, provides additional injection safety and convenience features because it physically combines the vaccine and AD syringe.
Selecting the appropriate vaccine presentation will depend on many factors.
However, multi-dose vials are likely to be most appropriate for cheaper vaccines and in settings where cold-chain storage capacity is restricted.
Single-dose formats will be most appropriate for more expensive vaccines and where there are problems with unsafe injection practices.
Prefilled AD injection devices will be particularly useful in expanding outreach services while eliminating the possibility of needle reuse.

Title
Health expectancy in the Russian Federation: a new perspective on the health divide in Europe.

OBJECTIVES
To compare life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in the Russian Federation and in countries of Eastern and Western Europe.

METHODS
WHO mortality data and data on self-reported health from the World Values Survey and the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey were used to compare the above three regions.
Life expectancy was calculated using Sullivan's method, with years of life lived divided into healthy and unhealthy.
The gap in healthy life expectancy between the Russian Federation and Western Europe was examined by decomposing the difference by gender and age.

FINDINGS
The probability of remaining alive and healthy declines faster in the Russian Federation than in Western Europe, with the gap between Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation widening at older ages.
In the Russian Federation, this rapid decline is due mainly to the high probability of death or of poor health for men and women, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
There is a large toll of premature male mortality in the Russian Federation but there also appears to be a substantial burden of ill-health among women.
As in other countries, the responses of men and women to adversity differ, leading to premature death in men but survival in a poor state of health in women.
Epidemiological studies including objective measures of health would help policy-makers to estimate more precisely the scale and nature of this problem.
Policy-makers must recognize that health expectancy in the Russian Federation is reduced in both men and women.

Title
Do childhood vaccines have non-specific effects on mortality?.

Abstract
A recent article by Kristensen et al. suggested that measles vaccine and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine might reduce mortality beyond what is expected simply from protection against measles and tuberculosis.
Previous reviews of the potential effects of childhood vaccines on mortality have not considered methodological features of reviewed studies.
Methodological considerations play an especially important role in observational assessments, in which selection factors for vaccination may be difficult to ascertain.
We reviewed 782 English language articles on vaccines and childhood mortality and found only a few whose design met the criteria for methodological rigor.
The data reviewed suggest that measles vaccine delivers its promised reduction in mortality, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest a mortality benefit above that caused by its effect on measles disease and its sequelae.
Our review of the available data in the literature reinforces how difficult answering these considerations has been and how important study design will be in determining the effect of specific vaccines on all-cause mortality.

Title
Diagnosis of paediatric HIV infection in a primary health care setting with a clinical algorithm.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the validity of an algorithm used by primary care health workers to identify children with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
This HIV algorithm is being implemented in South Africa as part of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), a strategy that aims to improve childhood morbidity and mortality by improving care at the primary care level.
As AIDS is a leading cause of death in children in southern Africa, diagnosis and management of symptomatic HIV infection was added to the existing IMCI algorithm.

METHODS
In total, 690 children who attended the outpatients department in a district hospital in South Africa were assessed with the HIV algorithm and by a paediatrician.
All children were then tested for HIV viral load.
The validity of the algorithm in detecting symptomatic HIV was compared with clinical diagnosis by a paediatrician and the result of an HIV test.
Detailed clinical data were used to improve the algorithm.

FINDINGS
Overall, 198 (28.7%) enrolled children were infected with HIV.
The paediatrician correctly identified 142 (71.7%) children infected with HIV, whereas the IMCI/HIV algorithm identified 111 (56.1%).
Odds ratios were calculated to identify predictors of HIV infection and used to develop an improved HIV algorithm that is 67.2% sensitive and 81.5% specific in clinically detecting HIV infection.

CONCLUSIONS
Children with symptomatic HIV infection can be identified effectively by primary level health workers through the use of an algorithm.
The improved HIV algorithm developed in this study could be used by countries with high prevalences of HIV to enable IMCI practitioners to identify and care for HIV-infected children.

Title
Field trial of applicability of lot quality assurance sampling survey method for rapid assessment of prevalence of active trachoma.

OBJECTIVE
To test the applicability of lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) for the rapid assessment of the prevalence of active trachoma.

METHODS
Prevalence of active trachoma in six communities was found by examining all children aged 2-5 years.
Trial surveys were conducted in these communities.
A sampling plan appropriate for classifying communities with prevalences <20% and >40% was applied to the survey data.
Operating characteristic and average sample number curves were plotted, and screening test indices were calculated.
The ability of LQAS to provide a three-class classification system was investigated.

FINDINGS
Ninety-six trial surveys were conducted.
All communities with prevalences <20% and >40% were identified correctly.
The method discriminated between communities with prevalences <30% and >30%, with sensitivity of 98% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 88.2-99.9%), specificity of 84.4% (CI = 69.9-93.0%), positive predictive value of 87.7% (CI = 75.7-94.5%), negative predictive value of 97.4% (CI = 84.9-99.9%), and accuracy of 91.7% (CI = 83.8-96.1%).
Agreement between the three prevalence classes and survey classifications was 84.4% (CI = 75.2-90.7%).
The time needed to complete the surveys was consistent with the need to complete a survey in one day.

CONCLUSION
Lot quality assurance sampling provides a method of classifying communities according to the prevalence of active trachoma.
It merits serious consideration as a replacement for the assessment of the prevalence of active trachoma with the currently used trachoma rapid assessment method.
It may be extended to provide a multi-class classification method.

Title
A future without health? Health dimension in global scenario studies.

Abstract
This paper reviews the health dimension and sociocultural, economic, and ecological determinants of health in existing global scenario studies.
Not even half of the 31 scenarios reviewed gave a good description of future health developments and the different scenario studies did not handle health in a consistent way.
Most of the global driving forces of health are addressed adequately in the selected scenarios, however, and it therefore would have been possible to describe the future developments in health as an outcome of these multiple driving forces.
To provide examples on how future health can be incorporated in existing scenarios, we linked the sociocultural, economic, and environmental developments described in three sets of scenarios (special report on emission scenarios (SRES), global environmental outlook-3 (GEO3), and world water scenarios (WWS)) to three potential, but imaginary, health futures ("age of emerging infectious diseases", "age of medical technology", and "age of sustained health").
This paper provides useful insights into how to deal with future health in scenarios and shows that a comprehensive picture of future health evolves when all important driving forces and pressures are taken into account.

Title
Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses: current state of knowledge.

Abstract
Within the past 4 years, poliomyelitis outbreaks associated with circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) have occurred in Hispaniola (2000-01), the Philippines (2001), and Madagascar (2001-02).
Retrospective studies have also detected the circulation of endemic cVDPV in Egypt (1988-93) and the likely localized spread of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)-derived virus in Belarus (1965-66).
Gaps in OPV coverage and the previous eradication of the corresponding serotype of indigenous wild poliovirus were the critical risk factors for all cVDPV outbreaks.
The cVDPV outbreaks were stopped by mass immunization campaigns using OPV.
To increase sensitivity for detecting vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), in 2001 the Global Polio Laboratory Network implemented additional testing requirements for all poliovirus isolates under investigation.
This approach quickly led to the recognition of the Philippines and Madagascar cVDPV outbreaks, but of no other current outbreaks.
The potential risk of cVDPV emergence has increased dramatically in recent years as wild poliovirus circulation has ceased in most of the world.
The risk appears highest for the type 2 OPV strain because of its greater tendency to spread to contacts.
The emergence of cVDPVs underscores the critical importance of eliminating the last pockets of wild poliovirus circulation, maintaining universally high levels of polio vaccine coverage, stopping OPV use as soon as it is safely possible to do so, and continuing sensitive poliovirus surveillance into the foreseeable future.
Particular attention must be given to areas where the risks for wild poliovirus circulation have been highest, and where the highest rates of polio vaccine coverage must be maintained to suppress cVDPV emergence.

Title
Polio control after certification: major issues outstanding.

Abstract
Now that the global eradication of wild poliovirus is almost within sight, planning for the post-certification era is becoming a priority issue.
It is agreed that a stockpile of appropriate polio vaccines will need to be established, and a surveillance and response capacity will need to be maintained, in order to protect the world against any possible future outbreaks attributable either to the persistence of wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) or to the unintentional or intentional release of poliovirus from a laboratory or vaccine store.
Although it has been suggested that the stockpile should consist of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV), many questions remain concerning its nature, financing, management, and use - in particular, because of uncertainties over future national vaccination policies, and over the availability of different vaccines, after the certification of wild poliovirus eradication.
There are further uncertainties concerning the possible role and efficacy of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) used either routinely or in outbreak control in low-hygiene settings, the potential for rapid geographical spread of polioviruses should an outbreak occur after certification, and the risks inherent in introducing additional oral polio vaccine (OPV) viruses into populations in which the vaccine coverage and prevalence of immunity have declined, and which may thus favour the spread of VDPVs.
Given these important gaps in knowledge, no country should discontinue polio vaccination until a coordinated policy for the post-certification era has been developed and the recommended measures have been put in place.

Title
Will containment of wild poliovirus in laboratories and inactivated poliovirus vaccine production sites be effective for global certification?.

Abstract
The absolute laboratory containment of any virus cannot be guaranteed, but a wealth of experience indicates that effective containment of wild poliovirus materials for global certification is technically and operationally feasible.
Effective containment is based on the principles of minimal wild poliovirus infectious and potentially infectious materials in laboratories; minimal risks of operations in laboratories and inactivated poliovirus vaccine production facilities; minimal susceptibility of workers to wild poliovirus infection and shedding; and minimal susceptibility of populations to wild poliovirus spread.
Each principle alone is imperfect, but collectively they greatly minimize the risks of transmitting wild poliovirus from the laboratory to the community.

Title
Control of tuberculosis in an urban setting in Nepal: public-private partnership.

OBJECTIVES
To implement and evaluate a public-private partnership to deliver the internationally recommended strategy DOTS for the control of tuberculosis (TB) in Lalitpur municipality, Nepal, where it is estimated that 50% of patients with TB are managed in the private sector.

METHODS
A local working group developed a public-private partnership for control of TB, which included diagnosis by private practitioners, direct observation of treatment and tracing of patients who missed appointments by nongovernmental organizations, and provision of training and drugs by the Nepal National TB Programme (NTP).
The public-private partnership was evaluated through baseline and follow-up surveys of private practitioners, private pharmacies, and private laboratories, together with records kept by the Nepal NTP.

FINDINGS
In the first 36 months, 1328 patients with TB were registered in the public-private partnership.
Treatment success rates were >90%, and <1% of patients defaulted.
Case notification of sputum-positive patients in the study area increased from 54 per 100 000 to 102 per 100 000.
The numbers of patients with TB started on treatment by private practitioners decreased by more than two-thirds, the number of private pharmacies that stocked anti-TB drugs by one-third, the number of pharmacies selling anti-TB drugs by almost two-thirds, and sales of anti-TB drugs in pharmacies by almost two-thirds.
Private practitioners were happy to refer patients to the public-private partnership.
Not all private practitioners had to be involved: many patients bypassed private practitioners and went directly to free DOTS centres.

CONCLUSIONS
A combination of the strengths of private practitioners, nongovernmental organizations, and the public sector in a public-private partnership can be used to provide a service that is liked by patients and gives high rates of treatment success and increased rates of patient notification.
Similar public-private partnerships are likely to be replicable elsewhere, as inputs are not large and no special requirements exist.

Title
Comparison of patient evaluations of health care quality in relation to WHO measures of achievement in 12 European countries.

OBJECTIVES
To gain insight into similarities and differences in patient evaluations of quality of primary care across 12 European countries and to correlate patient evaluations with WHO health system performance measures (for example, responsiveness) of these countries.

METHODS
Patient evaluations were derived from a series of Quote (QUality of care Through patients' Eyes) instruments designed to measure the quality of primary care.
Various research groups provided a total sample of 5133 patients from 12 countries: Belarus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, United Kingdom, and Ukraine.
Intraclass correlations of 10 Quote items were calculated to measure differences between countries.
The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance performance measures in the same countries were correlated with mean Quote scores.

FINDINGS
Intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from low to very high, which indicated little variation between countries in some respects (for example, primary care providers have a good understanding of patients' problems in all countries) and large variation in other respects (for example, with respect to prescription of medication and communication between primary care providers).
Most correlations between mean Quote scores per country and WHO performance measures were positive.
The highest correlation (0.86) was between the primary care provider's understanding of patients' problems and responsiveness according to WHO.

CONCLUSIONS
Patient evaluations of the quality of primary care showed large differences across countries and related positively to WHO's performance measures of health care systems.

Title
Discontinuation of cost sharing in Uganda.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the effects of ending cost sharing on use of outpatient services and how this was perceived by health workers and members of a health unit management committee.

METHODS
From 10 districts across Uganda, 78 health facilities were selected.
Attendance at these facilities was assessed for eight months before and 12 months after cost sharing ended.
The data represented 1 966 522 outpatient visits.
Perceptions about the impact of ending cost sharing were obtained from the 73 health workers and 78 members of the health unit management committee who were available.

FINDINGS
With the end of cost sharing, the mean monthly number of new visits increased by 17 928 (53.3%), but among children aged <5 years the increase was 3611 (27.3%).
Mean monthly reattendances increased by 2838 (81.3%) among children aged <5 years and 1889 (24.3%) among all people.
Attendances for immunizations, antenatal clinics, and family planning all increased, despite these services having always been free.
Health workers reported a decline in morale, and many health unit management committees no longer met regularly.

CONCLUSION
Use of all services increased - even those that had never before been subject to fees.
The loss of some autonomy by the health facility and diminished community governance of health facilities may have long term negative effects.

Title
The determinants of self-reported health-related quality of life in a culturally and socially diverse South African community.

OBJECTIVE
To determine factors predictive of the score on the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D questionnaire.

METHODS
The responses of 1159 residents of a socially and ethnically diverse suburb of Cape Town, South Africa, to the EQ-5D questionnaire were analysed using forward stepwise multiple regression.
The variables entered included ethnic group, religious affiliation (Christian or Muslim), income level, unemployment, recent illness or disability and each level of the five EQ-5D domains.

FINDINGS
The model developed accounted for an adjusted r2 of 0.234 and included 11 variables.
In addition to the EQ-5D domains, the presence of a disability, an income of less than US$ 420 per month, unemployment and age in years were significant predictors of VAS score.

CONCLUSION
The substantial contribution of health state to the VAS indicates that it is a valid measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) across population groups.
However, the subjects with lower social status reported a worse HRQoL than their health state alone warranted and this variable might need to be taken into account if the VAS is to be used to compare health states across populations.
This paper provides empirical evidence of how HRQoL is perceived by different socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic and religious communities within a developing country.

Title
Population ageing in Lebanon: current status, future prospects and implications for policy.

Abstract
During the past three decades, fast declines in fertility and mortality in Lebanon have created a compressed demographic transition, a growing trend towards survival into later life, and a larger proportion of elderly people in the population.
Projections show that people aged 65 years and over are expected to constitute 10.2% of the population by 2025.
Nevertheless, changes to the structure and composition of the population remain unmatched by any corresponding increase in support measures either through formal channels such as pension plans or through health or socioeconomic security measures such as the provision of subsidies for health care, home help or any form of nursing care.
This means that an older person is forced to be dependent upon family support if it exists.
We examine demographic trends of population ageing in Lebanon between 1970 and 1995 and provide projections until 2025.
Variations in population ageing within the country are also considered.
We also assess health care and social policy implications of demographic changes in the context of health and economic sector reforms initiated recently by the state, and explore their impact upon the expanding population of elderly people.

Title
Current and future worldwide prevalence of dependency, its relationship to total population, and dependency ratios.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the number of people worldwide requiring daily assistance from another person in carrying out health, domestic or personal tasks.

METHODS
Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study were used to calculate the prevalence of severe levels of disability, and consequently, to estimate dependency.
Population projections were used to forecast changes over the next 50 years.

FINDINGS
The greatest burden of dependency currently falls in sub-Saharan Africa, where the "dependency ratio" (ratio of dependent people to the population of working age) is about 10%, compared with 7-8% elsewhere.
Large increases in prevalence are predicted in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America of up to 5-fold or 6-fold in some cases.
These increases will occur in the context of generally increasing populations, and dependency ratios will increase modestly to about 10%.
The dependency ratio will increase more in China (14%) and India (12%) than in other areas with large prevalence increases.
Established market economies, especially Europe and Japan, will experience modest increases in the prevalence of dependency (30%), and in the dependency ratio (up to 10%).
Former Socialist economies of Europe will have static or declining numbers of dependent people, but will have large increases in the dependency ratio (up to 13%).

CONCLUSION
Many countries will be greatly affected by the increasing number of dependent people and will need to identify the human and financial resources to support them.
Much improved collection of data on disability and on the needs of caregivers is required.
The prevention of disability and provision of support for caregivers needs greater priority.

Title
Rates, barriers and outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among women in developing countries: implications for prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes.

Abstract
This paper synthesizes the rates, barriers, and outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among women in developing countries.
We identified 17 studies from peer-reviewed journals and international conference abstracts - 15 from sub-Saharan Africa and 2 from south-east Asia - that included information on either the rates, barriers or outcomes of HIV serostatus disclosure among women in developing countries.
The rates of disclosure reported in these studies ranged from 16.7% to 86%, with women attending free-standing voluntary HIV testing and counselling clinics more likely to disclose their HIV status to their sexual partners than women who were tested in the context of their antenatal care.
Barriers to disclosure identified by the women included fear of accusations of infidelity, abandonment, discrimination and violence.
Between 3.5% and 14.6% of women reported experiencing a violent reaction from a partner following disclosure.
The low rates of HIV serostatus disclosure reported among women in antenatal settings have several implications for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (pMTCT) programmes as the optimal uptake and adherence to such programmes is difficult for women whose partners are either unaware or not supportive of their participation.
This article discusses these implications and offers some strategies for safely increasing the rates of HIV status disclosure among women.

Title
Sexual violence against intimate partners in Cape Town: prevalence and risk factors reported by men.

OBJECTIVE
To describe the prevalence of and risk factors for the perpetration of sexual violence by men against female intimate partners.

METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1368 randomly selected men working in three Cape Town municipalities.
The men were interviewed with the aid of a questionnaire on current sexual partners in the preceding 10 years, personal and relationship characteristics and the use of violence against their partners.

RESULTS
The perpetration of sexual violence against intimate partners in the past 10 years was reported by 15.3% of the men.
After adjustment for sociodemographic circumstances, the factors associated with such violence were involvement in physical conflict outside the home, problematic alcohol use, having more than one current partner and abusing partners verbally.
While having frequent conflict with partners was important for the risk of sexual violence, only two types of conflict sources were significantly associated with this risk, namely conflict over sexual refusal and conflict when men perceived their authority to be undermined.

CONCLUSION
Sexual violence in intimate relations was common.
The risk of being sexually violent was associated with the use of violence to solve problems in other settings, having more than one current partner, alcohol abuse and verbally abusing a partner.
It was also associated with particular types of conflict stemming from ideas of male sexual entitlement and dominance.
Prevention programmes that focus on gender relations and non-violent conflict resolution for men and youths may be useful in combating such sexual violence.

Title
Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis reduces mortality in human immunodeficiency virus-positive tuberculosis patients in Karonga District, Malawi.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the impact of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis on the survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients.

METHODS
A cohort study with a historical comparison group was conducted.
End-of-treatment outcomes and 18-month survival were compared between TB patients registered in 1999 and patients registered in 2000 in Karonga District, Malawi.
Case ascertainment, treatment and outpatient follow-up were identical in the two years except that in 2000 cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was offered to HIV-positive patients in addition to routine care.
The prophylaxis was provided from the time a patient was identified as HIV-positive until 12 months after registration.
Analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis for all TB patients, and also separately by HIV status, TB type and certainty of diagnosis.

FINDINGS
355 and 362 TB patients were registered in 1999 and 2000, respectively; 70% were HIV-positive.
The overall case fatality rate fell from 37% to 29%, i.e. for every 12.5 TB patients treated, one death was averted.
Case fatality rates were unchanged between the two years in HIV-negative patients, but fell in HIV-positive patients from 43% to 24%.
The improved survival became apparent after the first 2 months and was maintained beyond the end of treatment.
The improvement was most marked in patients with smear-positive TB and others with confirmed TB diagnoses.

CONCLUSION
Survival of HIV-positive TB patients improved dramatically with the addition of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to the treatment regimen.
The improvement can be attributed to cotrimoxazole because other factors were unchanged and the survival of HIV-negative patients was not improved.
Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should therefore be added to the routine care of HIV-positive TB patients.

Title
Economic and programmatic aspects of congenital syphilis prevention.

Abstract
A review of the economic and programmatic aspects of congenital syphilis was conducted and recommendations made for improvement of its prevention.
Congenital syphilis is a preventable disease and the tools to prevent it have been available for decades.
In both industrialized and developing countries, but particularly the latter, the prevention of congenital syphilis by antenatal screening is cost-effective and may be cost-saving.
Yet, globally, there are probably >500 000 fetal deaths a year from congenital syphilis, a figure rivalling that from mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which receives far greater attention.
The reasons that congenital syphilis persists vary, with international and national under-appreciation of the burden of congenital syphilis and insufficient political will to provide effective antenatal screening programmes probably being the main reasons.
All causes are amenable to effective intervention programmes.
The prevention of congenital syphilis should be a global priority; international agencies and national programmes should be committed to improving antenatal care (ANC) services including syphilis detection and prevention.

Title
Antenatal syphilis control: people, programmes, policies and politics.

Abstract
Antenatal syphilis control is an integral component of reproductive health policies in most countries.
In many of these countries, however, the existence of a health policy does not automatically translate into an effective health programme.
We argue that neglecting to take into account the perspectives of all stakeholders when planning programmes may be the reason that functional and sustained interventions for antenatal syphilis are lacking.
Stakeholders may include health policy decision-makers, programme managers, service delivery personnel (on whom implementation depends), as well as the pregnant women, families, and communities who will most benefit from the intervention.
We describe how to undertake a multilevel assessment in order to identify stakeholders, identify interlinked perspectives, and analyse these perspectives within the socioeconomic, cultural and political environment within which an intervention is designed to be delivered.
Using this multidisciplinary approach, we propose that the barriers to, and opportunities for, turning health policy into effective practice will be identified, and the result will be the formulation of a broad programme response to ensure implementation of the policy.
Undertaking a multilevel assessment is but the first step in identifying barriers to successful programmes.
Currently there is a lack of strong political support for this intervention at national and international levels.
Devising strategies to address these potential barriers requires a broad range of skills and approaches some of which are outlined in this paper.

Title
Maternal syphilis: pathophysiology and treatment.

Abstract
Despite the long history of medical interest in syphilis and its effects on pregnancy outcome, many fundamental questions about the pathophysiology and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy remain unanswered.
However, understanding has been advanced by recent scientific reports such as those which delineate the complete sequence of the genome of the syphilis spirochaete, provide a more precise description of fetal and neonate infection by use of rabbit infectivity tests and describe the gestational age distribution of fetal death secondary to syphilis.
It appears that fetal syphilitic involvement progresses in a rather predictable fashion, and although there is disagreement about the optimal prenatal treatment regimen, programmatic efforts to prevent fetal death must provide seropositive pregnant women with a recommended treatment early in pregnancy, and certainly before the third trimester.

Title
Genital herpes and human immunodeficiency virus: double trouble.

Abstract
The synergistic relationship between herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be substantial in developing countries that have high prevalences of both viral infections.
Genital herpes, most frequently caused by HSV-2, has become the leading cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide.
This review of recent research on genital herpes and enhanced susceptibility to, and transmission of, HIV is part of the "Advances in HIV/AIDS research series" which endeavours to form a bridge between the research into HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the practice of HIV/AIDS prevention, care and support in developing countries.
Research findings have shown that being seropositive for HSV-2 can increase the risk of HIV acquisition among high-risk HIV-negative people exposed to HIV and, likewise, the infectiousness of individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and HSV-2 can increase during periods of HSV-2 reactivation.
These observations have led to the initiation of several intervention trials and could ultimately lead to the setting of new priorities in public health and clinical practice.
WHO has recently issued new guidelines for the syndromic management of genital ulcer disease that include antiviral treatment for lesions consistent with genital herpes.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines in 2002 that recommended the use of type-specific serological tests for diagnosing HSV-2.
Recently launched proof-of-concept, HSV-2 intervention trials in several countries will help to determine the proportion of new HIV infections that could be prevented by suppression of HSV-2, and the findings from these studies will inform those involved in setting prevention and treatment priorities and strategies in developing countries.

Title
The natural history of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in adults in Africa: a literature review.

Abstract
About 30 million people in Africa are estimated to be living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), yet data about the natural history of infection on the continent are sparse.
We reviewed the literature on the natural history of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections among African adults.
Only one study, conducted in rural Uganda, has reported on survival from the time of HIV-1 seroconversion: the median was 9.8 years, which is similar to that reported in developed countries in the early stages of the epidemic and consistent with the findings from the follow-up of individuals identified by serological testing during community-based prevalence studies from Africa.
Progression to symptomatic disease was faster in Uganda than in developed countries, due largely to the high background level of morbidity.
Various studies suggest that people infected with HIV-2 survive longer and the course of the disease is possibly more variable than in people infected with HIV-1.
However no studies have investigated survival from time of seroconversion among people infected with HIV-2.
The majority of patients in hospital in Africa with either HIV-1 or HIV-2 have the clinical features of AIDS just before they die, and many are severely immunosuppressed.
This is similar to the situation in developed countries before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Potentially preventable infections are the leading causes of death among individuals infected with HIV-1.
Prophylactic regimens and better treatments could have some effect on survival, but major improvements in life expectancy will require HAART.

Title
Psychometric properties of the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-100) in patients with chronic diseases and their caregivers in China.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the psychometric properties of the WHO Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-100), a multi-dimensional, conceptualized, 100-item quality-of-life instrument.

METHODS
A total of 460 patients in China with chronic diseases (including hypertension, schizophrenia, stroke, end-stage renal disease, head and neck cancer and breast cancer) and 418 family members who were their caregivers were assessed at baseline and one year later.

FINDINGS
The WHOQOL-100 had acceptable internal consistency (a = 0.76-0.90 across domains).
There were strong correlations between the domains of WHOQOL-100 and the dimensions of the General Quality of Life Inventory (a = 0.72-0.82 across related domains).
Within domains most facet correlations were satisfactory, although some facets correlated more strongly with a domain other than that to which they had been assigned.
Principal component analysis produced four factors accounting for 61% of the total variance.

CONCLUSION
The WHOQOL-100 was able to discriminate between the different groups of patients and was sensitive to clinical change in patients' conditions.
It proved to be a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases and their caregivers in China.

Title
Improving antimicrobial use among health workers in first-level facilities: results from the Multi-Country Evaluation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to assess the effect of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) case management training on the use of antimicrobial drugs among health-care workers treating young children at first-level facilities.
Antimicrobial drugs are an essential child-survival intervention.
Ensuring that children younger than five who need these drugs receive them promptly and correctly can save their lives.
Prescribing these drugs only when necessary and ensuring that those who receive them complete the full course can slow the development of antimicrobial resistance.

METHODS
Data collected through observation-based surveys in randomly selected first-level health facilities in Brazil, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania were statistically analysed.
The surveys were carried out as part of the multi-country evaluation of IMCI effectiveness, cost and impact (MCE).

FINDINGS
Results from three MCE sites show that children receiving care from health workers trained in IMCI are significantly more likely to receive correct prescriptions for antimicrobial drugs than those receiving care from workers not trained in IMCI.
They are also more likely to receive the first dose of the drug before leaving the health facility, to have their caregiver advised how to administer the drug, and to have caregivers who are able to describe correctly how to give the drug at home as they leave the health facility.

CONCLUSION
IMCI case management training is an effective intervention to improve the rational use of antimicrobial drugs for sick children visiting first-level health facilities in low-income and middle-income countries.

Title
Cost-effectiveness of zinc as adjunct therapy for acute childhood diarrhoea in developing countries.

OBJECTIVE
To analyse the incremental costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of zinc used as adjunct therapy to standard treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea, including dysentery, and to reassess the cost-effectiveness of standard case management with oral rehydration salt (ORS).

METHODS
A decision tree was used to model expected clinical outcomes and expected costs under four alternative treatment strategies.
The best available epidemiological, clinical and economic evidence was used in the calculations, and the United Republic of Tanzania was the reference setting.
Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique and the potential impacts of uncertainty in single parameters were explored in one-way sensitivity analyses.

FINDINGS
ORS was found to be less cost-effective than previously thought.
The use of zinc as adjunct therapy significantly improved the cost-effectiveness of standard management of diarrhoea for dysenteric as well as non-dysenteric illness.
The results were particularly sensitive to mortality rates in non-dysenteric diarrhoea, but the alternative interventions can be defined as highly cost-effective even in pessimistic scenarios.

CONCLUSION
There is sufficient evidence to recommend the inclusion of zinc into standard case management of both dysenteric and non-dysenteric acute diarrhoea.
A direct transfer of our findings from the United Republic of Tanzania to other settings is not justified, but there are no indications of large geographical differences in the efficacy of zinc.
It is therefore plausible that our findings are also applicable to other developing countries.

Title
Health in south-eastern Europe: a troubled past, an uncertain future.

Abstract
The political and economic turmoil that occurred in south-eastern Europe in the last decade of the twentieth century left a legacy of physical damage.
This aspect of the conflict has received considerable coverage in the media.
However, surprisingly less has been reported about the effects of that turmoil on the health of the people living in the region.
In an attempt to identify and synthesize data on these effects, we carried out a systematic review and used the results to put together a searchable online database of documents, reports, and published material, the majority of which have not previously been easily accessible (http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/ecohost/see/index.php).
The database covers the period from the early 1990s to 2003 and will be of considerable interest to policy-makers.
It contains 762 items, many of them annotated and available for downloading.
This paper synthesizes the main findings obtained from the material in the database and emphasizes the need for concerted action to improve the health of people in south-eastern Europe.
Furthermore, we also recommend that agencies working in post-conflict situations should invest in developing and maintaining online databases that would be useful to others working in the area.

Title
The migration of nurses: trends and policies.

Abstract
This paper examines the policy context of the rise in the international mobility and migration of nurses.
It describes the profile of the migration of nurses and the policy context governing the international recruitment of nurses to five countries: Australia, Ireland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
We also examine the policy challenges for workforce planning and the design of health systems infrastructure.
Data are derived from registries of professional nurses, censuses, interviews with key informants, case studies in source and destination countries, focus groups, and empirical modelling to examine the patterns and implications of the movement of nurses across borders.
The flow of nurses to these destination countries has risen, in some cases quite substantially.
Recruitment from lower-middle income countries and low-income countries, as defined by The World Bank, dominate trends in nurse migration to the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the United States, while Norway and Australia, primarily register nurses from other high-income countries.
Inadequate data systems in many countries prevent effective monitoring of these workforce flows.
Policy options to manage nurse migration include: improving working conditions in both source and destination countries, instituting multilateral agreements to manage the flow more effectively, and developing compensation arrangements between source and destination countries.
Recommendations for enhancements to workforce data systems are provided.

Title
Data on the migration of health-care workers: sources, uses, and challenges.

Abstract
The migration of health workers within and between countries is a growing concern worldwide because of its impact on health systems in developing and developed countries alike.
Policy decisions need to be made at the national, regional and international levels to manage more effectively this phenomenon, but those decisions will be effective and correctly implemented and evaluated only if they are based on adequate statistical data.
Most statistics on the migration of health-care workers are neither complete nor fully comparable, and they are often underused, limited (because they often give only a broad description of the phenomena) and not as timely as required.
There is also a conflict between the wide range of potential sources of data and the poor statistical evidence on the migration of health personnel.
There are two major problems facing researchers who wish to provide evidence on this migration: the problems commonly faced when studying migration in general, such as definitional and comparability problems of "worker migrations" and those related to the specific movements of the health workforce.
This paper presents information on the uses of statistics and those who use them, the strengths and limitations of the main data sources, and other challenges that need to be met to obtain good evidence on the migration of health workers.
This paper also proposes methods to improve the collection, analysis, sharing, and use of statistics on the migration of health workers.

Title
Coverage and costs of childhood immunizations in Cameroon.

OBJECTIVE
To quantify the association between household-level and provider-level determinants and childhood immunization rates in Cameroon while also calculating the cost of childhood immunizations.

METHODS
This study uses multilevel regression analysis to calculate these relationships.
The 1998 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey and the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are the main sources of household-level data.
These surveys are supplemented by data from a 2002 survey of health facilities conducted in three provinces.
At the national level, immunization financing data were collected from the Ministry of Health and donors that support the national Expanded Programme on Immunization.

FINDINGS
The 1998 survey found that nationally 37% of children were fully immunized; the 2000 survey found that nationally 34% were fully immunized.
These results are strongly correlated with both the mother's level of education and the household's economic status.
Multilevel logistic regression shows that maternal education level is a stronger predictor of positive immunization status than is relative economic status.
Children of mothers with secondary education or higher education were 3 times more likely to be fully vaccinated than children whose mothers had not completed primary education.
At the health-facility level, both having an immunization plan and regular supervisory visits from someone at the health-district level are strongly positively associated with immunization rates.
The cost of routine vaccinations for each fully immunized child is US$ 12.73 when donors' contributions are included but not the costs of immunization campaigns.

CONCLUSION
Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found that costs per fully immunized child varied from US$ 2.19 to US$ 26.59 (not adjusted for inflation) in a range of low-income and middle-income countries.
The relatively low rates of immunization coverage in Cameroon, and the strong influence of the household's socioeconomic status - particularly the mother's level of education - on immunization rates suggest that the effectiveness of the Cameroon programme could be increased by promoting immunization and directing such programmes towards households with limited resources.

Title
Eradication versus control: the economics of global infectious disease policies.

Abstract
A disease is controlled if, by means of a public policy, the circulation of an infectious agent is restricted below the level that would be sustained by individuals acting independently to control the disease.
A disease is eliminated if it is controlled sufficiently to prevent an epidemic from occurring in a given geographical area.
Control and elimination are achieved locally, but a disease can only be eradicated if it is eliminated everywhere.
Eradication is plainly a more demanding goal, but it has two advantages over control.
First, the economics of eradication can be very favourable when eradication not only reduces infections but also avoids the need for vaccinations in future.
Indeed, when eradication is feasible, it will either pay to control it to a fairly low level or to eradicate it.
This suggests that, from an economics perspective, diseases that are eliminated in high-income countries are prime candidates for future eradication efforts.
Second, the incentives for countries to participate in an eradication initiative can be strong; indeed they can be even stronger than an international control programme.
Moreover, high-income countries typically benefit so much that they will be willing to finance elimination in developing countries.
Full financing of an eradication effort by nation-states is not always guaranteed, but it can be facilitated by a variety of means.
Hence, from the perspective of economics and international relations, eradication has a number of advantages over control.
The implications for smallpox and polio eradication programmes are discussed.

Title
Financial challenges of immunization: a look at GAVI.

Abstract
Securing reliable and adequate public funding for prevention services, even those that are considered highly cost effective, often presents a challenge.
This has certainly been the case with childhood immunizations in developing countries.
Although the traditional childhood vaccines cost relatively little, funding in poor countries is often at risk and subject to the political whims of donors and national governments.
With the introduction of newer and more costly vaccines made possible under the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the future financial challenges have become even greater.
Experience so far suggests that choosing to introduce new combination vaccines can significantly increase the costs of national immunization programmes.
With this experience comes a growing concern about their affordability in the medium term and long term and a realization that, for many countries, shared financial responsibility between national governments and international donors may initially be required.
This article focuses on how GAVI is addressing the challenge of sustaining adequate and reliable funding for immunizations in the poorest countries.

Title
Paying attention to gender and poverty in health research: content and process issues.

Abstract
Despite the magnitude of the problem of health inequity within and between countries, little systematic research has been done on the social causes of ill-health.
Health researchers have overwhelmingly focused on biomedical research at the level of individuals.
Investigations into the health of groups and the determinants of health inequities that lie outside the control of the individual have received a much smaller share of research resources.
Ignoring factors such as socioeconomic class, race and gender leads to biases in both the content and process of research.
We use two such factors - poverty and gender - to illustrate how this occurs.
There is a systematic imbalance in medical journals: research into diseases that predominate in the poorest regions of the world is less likely to be published.
In addition, the slow recognition of women's health problems, misdirected and partial approaches to understanding women's and men's health, and the dearth of information on how gender interacts with other social determinants continue to limit the content of health research.
In the research community these imbalances in content are linked to biases against researchers from poorer regions and women.
Researchers from high-income countries benefit from better funding and infrastructure.
Their publications dominate journals and citations, and these researchers also dominate advisory boards.
The way to move forward is to correct biases against poverty and gender in research content and processes and provide increased funding and better career incentives to support equity-linked research.
Journals need to address equity concerns in their published content and in the publishing process.
Efforts to broaden access to research information need to be well resourced, publicized and expanded.

Title
Knowledge-based changes to health systems: the Thai experience in policy development.

Abstract
Over the past two decades the government in Thailand has adopted an incremental approach to extending health-care coverage to the population.
It first offered coverage to government employees and their dependants, and then introduced a scheme under which low-income people were exempt from charges for health care.
This scheme was later extended to include elderly people, children younger than 12 years of age and disabled people.
A voluntary public insurance scheme was implemented to cover those who could afford to pay for their own care.
Private sector employees were covered by the Social Health Insurance scheme, which was implemented in 1991.
Despite these efforts, 30% of the population remained uninsured in 2001.
In October of that year, the new government decided to embark on a programme to provide universal health-care coverage.
This paper describes how research into health systems and health policy contributed to the move towards universal coverage.
Data on health systems financing and functioning had been gathered before and after the founding of the Health Systems Research Institute in early 1990.
In 1991, a contract capitation model had been used to launch the Social Health Insurance scheme.
The advantages of using a capitation model are that it contains costs and provides an acceptable quality of service as opposed to the cost escalation and inefficiency that occur under fee-for-service reimbursement models, such as the one used to provide medical benefits to civil servants.
An analysis of the implementation of universal coverage found that politics moved universal coverage onto the policy agenda during the general election campaign in January 2001.
The capacity for research on health systems and policy to generate evidence guided the development of the policy and the design of the system at a later stage.
Because the reformists who sought to bring about universal coverage (who were mostly civil servants in the Ministry of Public Health and members of nongovernmental organizations) were able to bridge the gap between researchers and politicians, an evidence-based political decision was made.
Additionally, the media played a part in shaping the societal consensus on universal coverage.

Title
Building capacity in health research in the developing world.

Abstract
Strong national health research systems are needed to improve health systems and attain better health.
For developing countries to indigenize health research systems, it is essential to build research capacity.
We review the positive features and weaknesses of various approaches to capacity building, emphasizing that complementary approaches to human resource development work best in the context of a systems and long-term perspective.
As a key element of capacity building, countries must also address issues related to the enabling environment, in particular: leadership, career structure, critical mass, infrastructure, information access and interfaces between research producers and users.
The success of efforts to build capacity in developing countries will ultimately depend on political will and credibility, adequate financing, and a responsive capacity-building plan that is based on a thorough situational analysis of the resources needed for health research and the inequities and gaps in health care.
Greater national and international investment in capacity building in developing countries has the greatest potential for securing dynamic and agile knowledge systems that can deliver better health and equity, now and in the future.

Title
Research synthesis and dissemination as a bridge to knowledge management: the Cochrane Collaboration.

Abstract
In the current information age, research synthesis is a particularly useful tool for keeping track of scientific research and making sense of the large volumes of frequently conflicting data derived from primary studies.
The Cochrane Collaboration is a global initiative "to help people make well-informed decisions about health care by preparing, maintaining and promoting the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of healthcare interventions".
In this paper we set the work of the Cochrane Collaboration in historical perspective, explain what a Cochrane review is, and describe initiatives for promoting worldwide dissemination of synthesized information.
We also consider emerging evidence of the Cochrane Collaboration's impact on health-care practice, policy, research and education.
Finally, we highlight the need for increased investment in the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane reviews, particularly those that address health issues that are relevant to people living in low- and middle-income countries.

Title
Vaccinovigilance in Europe: need for timeliness, standardization and resources.

OBJECTIVE
To identify gaps in the systems for reporting adverse events following immunization (AEFI) in Europe by means of an interactive database constructed using a standardized approach.

METHODS
A comparative survey was conducted in 1999-2000, using structured questionnaires addressed to the government authorities responsible for national immunization programmes and drug safety surveillance in all European Union (EU) Member States and in Norway and Switzerland.

FINDINGS
The reporting of adverse vaccine reactions (AVRs) is covered by regulations in 13 of the 17 countries.
Four countries have a specialized expert group with responsibility for vaccine safety.
Only six professionals work full-time on vaccine safety in the 17 countries; in four of these countries the person is medically qualified.
Fourteen countries have centralized reporting systems; in 14 countries the responsible authority is the drug regulatory agency.
AEFI are reported using the procedure used for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in all except four countries.
The reporting form is not usually designed for vaccines and important details may therefore not be requested.
Clinical definitions for vaccine reactions are not available.
Twelve countries have appropriate official definitions for events or reactions, but the list of reportable events varies considerably between countries.
The assessment of adverse vaccine reactions (AVRs) is hampered by lack of exact denominator data.
Feedback to the rapporteurs was provided in 13 countries, but its quality was highly variable.

CONCLUSION
The database facilitated a simple comparison of vaccinovigilance systems across participating countries.
Most of the problems identified related to the reporting and analysis of AEFI could be solved through standardization and intensified international collaboration.
On a national level, functional vaccinovigilance systems should be the shared responsibility of the drug regulatory authority and the national immunization programme.
The resources for development and management of vaccine safety systems should be urgently improved.

Title
Global data on visual impairment in the year 2002.

Abstract
This paper presents estimates of the prevalence of visual impairment and its causes in 2002, based on the best available evidence derived from recent studies.
Estimates were determined from data on low vision and blindness as defined in the International statistical classification of diseases, injuries and causes of death, 10th revision.
The number of people with visual impairment worldwide in 2002 was in excess of 161 million, of whom about 37 million were blind.
The burden of visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world: the least developed regions carry the largest share.
Visual impairment is also unequally distributed across age groups, being largely confined to adults 50 years of age and older.
A distribution imbalance is also found with regard to gender throughout the world: females have a significantly higher risk of having visual impairment than males.
Notwithstanding the progress in surgical intervention that has been made in many countries over the last few decades, cataract remains the leading cause of visual impairment in all regions of the world, except in the most developed countries.
Other major causes of visual impairment are, in order of importance, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and trachoma.

Title
Noncommunicable disease mortality in the Russian Federation: from legislation to policy.

Abstract
Political, social and economic transitions that occurred as a result of the regime change in Eastern Europe and the Russian Federation from the late 1980s to the early 1990s led to a sudden increase in mortality across the region, with more than 80% of deaths being attributable to preventable causes, such as cardiovascular disease, lifestyle factors and injuries.
The Russian Federation has experienced some of the most dramatic population declines in the world.
Countrywide health reforms have been implemented, although they continue to ignore the impact of the epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the Russian Federation.
Improvements in mortality patterns in the Russian Federation are possible only with the broader engagement of organized nongovernmental groups within the civil society that is strongly supported by Federal legislation to address NCDs.
We discuss the Russian Federal legislation germane to the prevention and control of NCDs in the light of the current mortality crisis and suggest possible policy responses to this crisis.

Title
ICD coding changes and discontinuities in trends in cause-specific mortality in six European countries, 1950-99.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate how often coding changes between and within revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) complicate the description of long-term trends in cause-specific mortality.

METHODS
Data on cause-specific mortality between 1950 and 1999 for men and women aged 60 and older were obtained from Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
Data were obtained by five-year age groups.
We constructed a concordance table using three-digit ICD codes.
In addition we evaluated the occurrence of mortality discontinuities by visually inspecting cause-specific trends and country-specific background information.
Evaluation was also based on quantification of the discontinuities using a Poisson regression model (including period splines).
We compared the observed trends in cause-specific mortality with the trends after adjustment for the discontinuities caused by changes to coding.

FINDINGS
In 45 out of 416 (10.8 %) instances of ICD revisions to cause-specific mortality codes, significant discontinuities that were regarded as being due to ICD revisions remained.
The revisions from ICD-6 and ICD-7 to ICD-8 and a wide range of causes of death, with the exception of the specific cancers, were especially affected.
Incidental changes in coding rules were also important causes of discontinuities in trends in cause-specific mortality, especially in England and Wales, Finland and Sweden.
Adjusting for these discontinuities can lead to significant changes in trends, although these primarily affect only limited periods of time.

CONCLUSION
Despite using a carefully constructed concordance table based on three-digit ICD codes, mortality discontinuities arising as a result of coding changes (both between and within revisions) can lead to substantial changes in long-term trends in cause-specific mortality.
Coding changes should therefore be evaluated by researchers and, where necessary, controlled for.

Title
Religion-based tobacco control interventions: how should WHO proceed?.

Abstract
Using religion to improve health is an age-old practice.
However, using religion and enlisting religious authorities in public health campaigns, as exemplified by tobacco control interventions and other activities undertaken by WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, is a relatively recent phenomenon.
Although all possible opportunities within society should be exploited to control tobacco use and promote health, religion-based interventions should not be exempted from the evidence-based scrutiny to which other interventions are subjected before being adopted.
In the absence of data and debate on whether this approach works, how it should be applied, and what the potential downsides and alternatives are, international organizations such as WHO should think carefully about using religion-based public health interventions in their regional programmes.

Title
Health in the developing world: achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Abstract
The Millennium Development Goals depend critically on scaling up public health investments in developing countries.
As a matter of urgency, developing-country governments must present detailed investment plans that are sufficiently ambitious to meet the goals, and the plans must be inserted into existing donor processes.
Donor countries must keep the promises they have often reiterated of increased assistance, which they can easily afford, to help improve health in the developing countries and ensure stability for the whole world.

Title
A field trial of a survey method for estimating the coverage of selective feeding programmes.

OBJECTIVE
To test a survey method for estimating the coverage of selective feeding programmes in humanitarian emergencies.

METHODS
The trial survey used a stratified design with strata that were defined using the centric systematic area sample method.
Thirty 100 km² quadrats were sampled.
The communities located closest to the centre of each quadrat were sampled using a case-finding approach.

FINDINGS
The method proved simple and rapid to implement and allowed overall and per-quadrat coverage to be estimated.
Overall coverage was 20.0% (95% confidence intervals, 13.8-26.3%).
Per-quadrat coverage ranged from zero (in nine quadrats) to 50% (in one quadrat).
Coverage was highest in the quadrats closest to therapeutic feeding centres and in quadrats containing major roads leading to the towns in which therapeutic feeding centres were located.

CONCLUSION
The method should be used, in preference to WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-derived survey methods, for estimating the coverage of selective feeding programmes.
Its use should also be considered when evaluating the coverage of other selective entry programmes or when coverage is likely to be spatially inhomogeneous.

Title
Control of scabies, skin sores and haematuria in children in the Solomon Islands: another role for ivermectin.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the effects of a 3-year programme aimed at controlling scabies on five small lagoon islands in the Solomon Islands by monitoring scabies, skin sores, streptococcal skin contamination, serology and haematuria in the island children.

METHODS
Control was achieved by treating almost all residents of each island once or twice within 2 weeks with ivermectin (160-250 µg/kg), except for children who weighed less than 15 kg and pregnant women, for whom 5% permethrin cream was used.
Reintroduction of scabies was controlled by treating returning residents and visitors, whether or not they had evident scabies.

FINDINGS
Prevalence of scabies dropped from 25% to less than 1% (P < 0.001); prevalence of sores from 40% to 21% (P < 0.001); streptococcal contamination of the fingers in those with and without sores decreased significantly (P = 0.02 and 0.047, respectively) and anti-DNase B levels decreased (P = 0.002).
Both the proportion of children with haematuria and its mean level fell (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively).
No adverse effects of the treatments were seen.

CONCLUSION
The results show that ivermectin is an effective and practical agent in the control of scabies and that control reduces the occurrence of streptococcal skin disease and possible signs of renal damage in children.
Integrating community-based control of scabies and streptococcal skin disease with planned programmes for controlling filariasis and intestinal nematodes could be both practical and produce great health benefits.

Title
Arsenic contamination of groundwater and its health impact on residents in a village in West Bengal, India.

Abstract
An in-depth study was carried out in Rajapur, an arsenic-affected village in West Bengal, India, to determine the degree of groundwater contamination with arsenic and the impact of this contamination on residents.
The flow injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG-AAS) method was used to measure arsenic concentrations in water and biological samples.
Dermatologists recorded the dermatological features of arsenicosis.
Out of a total of 336 hand-pumped tube-wells in Rajapur, 91% (307/336) contained arsenic at concentrations > 10 µg/l, and 63% (213/336) contained arsenic at > 50 µg/l.
The type of arsenic in groundwater, the variation in concentrations of arsenic as the depth of tube-wells changed, and the iron concentration in the wells were also measured.
Altogether 825 of 3500 residents were examined for skin lesions; of these, 149 had lesions caused by exposure to arsenic.
Of the 420 biological samples collected and analysed, 92.6% (389) contained arsenic at concentrations that were above normal.
Thus many villagers might be subclinically affected.
Although five arsenic-filtering devices had been installed in Rajapur, it appears that villagers are still exposed to raised concentrations of arsenic in their drinking-water.
Detailed village-level studies of arsenic-affected areas in West Bengal are required in order to understand the magnitude of contamination and its effects on people.
Villagers are ill-informed about the dangers of drinking arsenic-contaminated water.
The contamination could be brought under control by increasing community awareness of the dangers and implementing proper watershed management techniques that involve local people.

Title
Multisource drug policies in Latin America: survey of 10 countries.

Abstract
Essential drug lists and generic drug policies have been promoted as strategies to improve access to pharmaceuticals and control their rapidly escalating costs.
This article reports the results of a preliminary survey conducted in 10 Latin American countries.
The study aimed to document the experiences of different countries in defining and implementing generic drug policies, determine the cost of registering different types of pharmaceutical products and the time needed to register them, and uncover the incentives governments have developed to promote the use of multisource drugs.
The survey instrument was administered in person in Chile, Ecuador and Peru and by email in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Uruguay.
There was a total of 22 respondents.
Survey responses indicated that countries use the terms generic and bioequivalence differently.
We suggest there is a need to harmonize definitions and technical concepts.

Title
Socioeconomic differences in the burden of disease in Sweden.

OBJECTIVE
We sought to analyse how much of the total burden of disease in Sweden, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), is a result of inequalities in health between socioeconomic groups.
We also sought to determine how this unequal burden is distributed across different disease groups and socioeconomic groups.

METHODS
Our analysis used data from the Swedish Burden of Disease Study.
We studied all Swedish men and women in three age groups (15-44, 45-64, 65-84) and five major socioeconomic groups.
The 18 disease and injury groups that contributed to 65% of the total burden of disease were analysed using attributable fractions and the slope index of inequality and the relative index of inequality.

FINDINGS
About 30% of the burden of disease among women and 37% of the burden among men is a differential burden resulting from socioeconomic inequalities in health.
A large part of this unequally distributed burden falls on unskilled manual workers.
The largest contributors to inequalities in health for women are ischaemic heart disease, depression and neurosis, and stroke.
For men, the largest contributors are ischaemic heart disease, alcohol addiction and self-inflicted injuries.

CONCLUSION
This is the first study to use socioeconomic differences, measured by socioeconomic position, to assess the burden of disease using DALYs.
We found that in Sweden one-third of the burden of the diseases we studied is unequally distributed.
Studies of socioeconomic inequalities in the burden of disease that take both mortality and morbidity into account can help policy-makers understand the magnitude of inequalities in health for different disease groups.

Title
Private health insurance: implications for developing countries.

Abstract
Private health insurance is playing an increasing role in both high- and low-income countries, yet is poorly understood by researchers and policy-makers.
This paper shows that the distinction between private and public health insurance is often exaggerated since well regulated private insurance markets share many features with public insurance systems.
It notes that private health insurance preceded many modern social insurance systems in western Europe, allowing these countries to develop the mechanisms, institutions and capacities that subsequently made it possible to provide universal access to health care.
We also review international experiences with private insurance, demonstrating that its role is not restricted to any particular region or level of national income.
The seven countries that finance more than 20% of their health care via private health insurance are Brazil, Chile, Namibia, South Africa, the United States, Uruguay and Zimbabwe.
In each case, private health insurance provides primary financial protection for workers and their families while public health-care funds are targeted to programmes covering poor and vulnerable populations.
We make recommendations for policy in developing countries, arguing that private health insurance cannot be ignored.
Instead, it can be harnessed to serve the public interest if governments implement effective regulations and focus public funds on programmes for those who are poor and vulnerable.
It can also be used as a transitional form of health insurance to develop experience with insurance institutions while the public sector increases its own capacity to manage and finance health-care coverage.

Title
Counting the dead and what they died from: an assessment of the global status of cause of death data.

OBJECTIVE
We sought to assess the current status of global data on death registration and to examine several indicators of data completeness and quality.

METHODS
We summarized the availability of death registration data by year and country.
Indicators of data quality were assessed for each country and included the timeliness, completeness and coverage of registration and the proportion of deaths assigned to ill-defined causes.

FINDINGS
At the end of 2003 data on death registration were available from 115 countries, although they were essentially complete for only 64 countries.
Coverage of death registration varies from close to 100% in the WHO European Region to less than 10% in the African Region.
Only 23 countries have data that are more than 90% complete, where ill-defined causes account for less than 10% of total of causes of death, and where ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes are used.
There are 28 countries where less than 70% of the data are complete or where ill-defined codes are assigned to more than 20% of deaths.
Twelve high-income countries in western Europe are included among the 55 countries with intermediate-quality data.

CONCLUSION
Few countries have good-quality data on mortality that can be used to adequately support policy development and implementation.
There is an urgent need for countries to implement death registration systems, even if only through sample registration, or enhance their existing systems in order to rapidly improve knowledge about the most basic of health statistics: who dies from what?

Title
World mortality 1950-2000: divergence replaces convergence from the late 1980s.

OBJECTIVE
We sought to investigate to what extent worldwide improvements in mortality over the past 50 years have been accompanied by convergence in the mortality experience of the world's population.

METHODS
We have adopted a novel approach to the objective measurement of global mortality convergence.
The global mortality distribution at a point in time is quantified using a dispersion measure of mortality (DMM).
Trends in the DMM indicate global mortality convergence and divergence.
The analysis uses United Nations data for 1950-2000 for all 152 countries with populations of at least 1 million in 2000 (99.7% of the world's population in 2000).

FINDINGS
The DMM for life expectancy at birth declined until the late 1980s but has since increased, signalling a shift from global convergence to divergence in life expectancy at birth.
In contrast, the DMM for infant mortality indicates continued convergence since 1950.

CONCLUSION
The switch in the late 1980s from the global convergence of life expectancy at birth to divergence indicates that progress in reducing mortality differences between many populations is now more than offset by the scale of reversals in adult mortality in others.
Global progress needs to be judged on whether mortality convergence can be re-established and indeed accelerated.

Title
Leprosy: too complex a disease for a simple elimination paradigm.

Abstract
Can leprosy be eliminated?
This paper considers the question against the background of the WHO programme to eliminate leprosy.
In 1991 the World Health Assembly set a target of eliminating leprosy as a public health problem by 2000.
Elimination was defined as reaching a prevalence of < 1 case per 10 000 people.
The elimination programme has been successful in delivering highly effective antibiotic therapy worldwide.
However, despite this advance, new-case detection rates remain stable in countries with the highest rates of endemic leprosy, such as Brazil and India.
This suggests that infection has not been adequately controlled by antibiotics alone.
Leprosy is perhaps more appropriately classed as a chronic stable disease than as an acute infectious disease responsive to elimination strategies.
In many countries activities to control and treat leprosy are being integrated into the general health-care system.
This reduces the stigma associated with leprosy.
However, leprosy causes long-term immunological complications, disability and deformity.
The health-care activities of treating and preventing disabilities need to be provided in an integrated setting.
Detecting new cases and monitoring disability caused by leprosy will be a challenge.
One solution is to implement long-term surveillance in selected countries with the highest rates of endemic disease so that an accurate estimate of the burden of leprosy can be determined.
It is also critical that broad-based research into this challenging disease continues until the problems are truly solved.

Title
Quality of care for under-fives in first-level health facilities in one district of Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE
The multi-country evaluation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) effectiveness, cost and impact (MCE) is a global evaluation to determine the impact of IMCI on health outcomes and its cost-effectiveness.
MCE studies are under way in Bangladesh, Brazil, Peru, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.
The objective of this analysis from the Bangladesh MCE study was to describe the quality of care delivered to sick children under 5 years old in first-level government health facilities, to inform government planning of child health programmes.

METHODS
Generic MCE Health Facility Survey tools were adapted, translated and pre-tested.
Medical doctors trained in IMCI and these tools conducted the survey in all 19 health facilities in the study areas.
The data were collected using observations, exit interviews, inventories and interviews with facility providers.

FINDINGS
Few of the sick children seeking care at these facilities were fully assessed or correctly treated, and almost none of their caregivers were advised on how to continue the care of the child at home.
Over one-third of the sick children whose care was observed were managed by lower-level workers who were significantly more likely than higher-level workers to classify the sick child correctly and to provide correct information on home care to the caregiver.

CONCLUSION
These results demonstrate an urgent need for interventions to improve the quality of care provided for sick children in first-level facilities in Bangladesh, and suggest that including lower-level workers as targets for IMCI case-management training may be beneficial.
The findings suggest that the IMCI strategy offers a promising set of interventions to address the child health service problems in Bangladesh.

Title
Advance price or purchase commitments to create markets for treatments for diseases of poverty: lessons from three policies.

Abstract
New drugs and vaccines are needed for tackling diseases of poverty in low- and middle-income countries.
The lack of effective demand or market for these products translates into insufficient investment being made in research and development to meet the need for them.
Many have advocated cost-reducing (push) and market-enhancing (pull) incentives to tackle this problem.
Advance price or purchase commitments (APPCs) funded by international agencies and governments offer one way forward.
This paper looks at design issues for APPCs for drugs and vaccines for diseases of poverty drawing on experience and lessons from three case studies: the introduction of the meningitis C vaccine in the United Kingdom; the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in the United States of America (US); and the newly legislated US Project BioShield for bioterrorist interventions.
Our key conclusion is that that APPCs have the potential to be a powerful tool and should be tried.
The correct structure and design may only be determined through the process of taking action to set one up.

Title
Differences in prevalence of pre-existing morbidity between injured and non-injured populations.

OBJECTIVE
To identify and examine differences in pre-existing morbidity between injured and non-injured population-based cohorts.

METHODS
Administrative health data from Manitoba, Canada, were used to select a population-based cohort of injured people and a sample of non-injured people matched on age, gender, aboriginal status and geographical location of residence at the date of injury.
All individuals aged 18-64 years who had been hospitalized between 1988 and 1991 for injury (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code 800-995) (n = 21 032), were identified from the Manitoba discharge database.
The matched non-injured comparison group comprised individuals randomly selected 1:1 from the Manitoba population registry.
Morbidity data for the 12 months prior to the date of the injury were obtained by linking the two cohorts with all hospital discharge records and physician claims.

RESULTS
Compared to the non-injured group, injured people had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, 1.9 times higher rates of hospital admissions and 1.7 times higher rates of physician claims in the year prior to the injury.
Injured people had a rate of admissions to hospital for a mental health disorder 9.3 times higher, and physician claims for a mental health disorder 3.5 times higher, than that of non-injured people.
These differences were all statistically significant (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION
Injured people were shown to differ from the general non-injured population in terms of pre-existing morbidity.
Existing population estimates of the attributable burden of injury that are obtained by extrapolating from observed outcomes in samples of injured cases may overestimate the magnitude of the problem.

Title
Re-evaluating the burden of rabies in Africa and Asia.

OBJECTIVE
To quantify the public health and economic burden of endemic canine rabies in Africa and Asia.

METHODS
Data from these regions were applied to a set of linked epidemiological and economic models.
The human population at risk from endemic canine rabies was predicted using data on dog density, and human rabies deaths were estimated using a series of probability steps to determine the likelihood of clinical rabies developing in a person after being bitten by a dog suspected of having rabies.
Model outputs on mortality and morbidity associated with rabies were used to calculate an improved disability-adjusted life year (DALY) score for the disease.
The total societal cost incurred by the disease is presented.

FINDINGS
Human mortality from endemic canine rabies was estimated to be 55 000 deaths per year (90% confidence interval (CI) = 24 000-93 000).
Deaths due to rabies are responsible for 1.74 million DALYs lost each year (90% CI = 0.75-2.93).
An additional 0.04 million DALYs are lost through morbidity and mortality following side-effects of nerve-tissue vaccines.
The estimated annual cost of rabies is US$ 583.5 million (90% CI = US$ 540.1-626.3 million).
Patient-borne costs for post-exposure treatment form the bulk of expenditure, accounting for nearly half the total costs of rabies.

CONCLUSION
Rabies remains an important yet neglected disease in Africa and Asia.
Disparities in the affordability and accessibility of post-exposure treatment and risks of exposure to rabid dogs result in a skewed distribution of the disease burden across society, with the major impact falling on those living in poor rural communities, in particular children.

Title
The future of the HIV pandemic.

Abstract
The emerging HIV epidemics in countries of Asia and Eastern Europe will contribute significantly to the future of the HIV pandemic.
Forecasts of the scale of these epidemics are subject to massive uncertainty, however, mainly because of the sensitivity of predictions to small alterations in parameters that are difficult to estimate.
In most of these countries, HIV is currently concentrated among vulnerable populations such as injecting drug users, sex workers and their clients, or men who have sex with men.
This distribution suggests an alternative to disease forecasting based on the techniques of risk assessment routinely used by environmental epidemiologists.
Exposure mapping, dose-response curves and the concept of acceptable risk are some of the tools that may be useful for HIV risk management.
This approach is illustrated by a description of exposure in Indonesia and an assessment of currently accepted risk of death for different causes including HIV in the Russian Federation.
Although inappropriate for forecasts of heterosexual HIV transmission, mathematical models are shown to be useful for making qualitative predictions about the relative importance of different behaviours for the spread of HIV over time and for interpreting observed trends in HIV prevalence from sentinel surveillance sites.

Title
No cry at birth: global estimates of intrapartum stillbirths and intrapartum-related neonatal deaths.

OBJECTIVE
Fewer than 3% of 4 million annual neonatal deaths occur in countries with reliable vital registration (VR) data.
Global estimates for asphyxia-related neonatal deaths vary from 0.7 to 1.2 million.
Estimates for intrapartum stillbirths are not available.
We aimed to estimate the numbers of intrapartum-related neonatal deaths and intrapartum stillbirths in the year 2000.

METHODS
Sources of data on neonatal death included: vital registration (VR) data on neonatal death from countries with full (> 90%) VR coverage (48 countries, n = 97 297); studies identified through literature searches (> 4000 abstracts) and meeting inclusion criteria (46 populations, 30 countries, n = 12 355).
A regression model was fitted to cause-specific proportionate mortality data from VR and the literature.
Predicted cause-specific proportions were applied to the number of neonatal deaths by country, and summed to a global total.
Intrapartum stillbirths were estimated using median cause-specific mortality rate by country (73 populations, 52 countries, n = 46 779) or the subregional median in the absence of country data.

FINDINGS
Intrapartum-related neonatal deaths were estimated at 0.904 million (uncertainty 0.65-1.17), equivalent to 23% of the global total of 4 million neonatal deaths.
Country-level model predictions compared well with population-based data sets not included in the input data.
An estimated 1.02 million intrapartum stillbirths (0.66-1.48 million) occur annually, comprising 26% of global stillbirths.

CONCLUSION
Intrapartum-related neonatal deaths account for almost 10% of deaths in children aged under 5 years.
Intrapartum stillbirths are a huge and invisible problem, but are potentially preventable.
Programmatic attention and improved information are required.

Title
Has the burden of depression been overestimated?.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether high estimates of the burden of depression could be attributed to an overestimation of disability weights (reflecting more severe disability).

METHODS
We derived disability weights that were tailored to prevalence data.
Empirical disability data from a Dutch community survey was used to describe three classes of severity of depression and their proportional prevalence.
We obtained valuations from experts for each class and calculated the overall disability weight for depression.

FINDINGS
Expert valuations were similar to those of previous studies.
The overall disability weight for depression was similar to other studies except the 1994 Dutch Burden of Disease Calculation, which it exceeded by 73%.
The lower Dutch 1994 disability weight resulted from an overestimation of the proportion of mild cases of depression by experts (60% versus 27% observed in the empirical data used in the present study).

CONCLUSION
This study found no indication that disability associated with depression was overestimated.
The Dutch example showed the importance of tailoring disability weights to epidemiological data on prevalence.

Title
The costs of home delivery of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in a prefilled syringe in Indonesia.

OBJECTIVE
To provide global policy-makers with decision-making information for developing strategies for immunization of infants with a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, this paper presents a retrospective cost analysis, conducted in Indonesia, of delivering this vaccine at birth using the Uniject prefill injection device.

METHODS
Incremental costs or cost savings associated with changes in the hepatitis B immunization programme were calculated using sensitivity analysis to vary the estimates of vaccine wastage rates and prices for vaccines and injection devices, for the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine.

FINDINGS
The introduction of hepatitis B vaccine prefilled in Uniject™ (HB-Uniject) single-dose injection devices for use by midwives for delivering the birth dose is cost-saving when the wastage rate for multidose vials is greater than 33% (Uniject is a trademark of BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

CONCLUSION
The introduction of HB-Uniject for birth-dose delivery is economically worthwhile and can increase coverage of the critical birth dose, improve resource utilization, reduce transmission of hepatitis B and promote injection safety.

Title
Institutionalizing policy-level health impact assessment in Europe: is coupling health impact assessment with strategic environmental assessment the next step forward?.

Abstract
European Union (EU) Member States are interested in using health impact assessment (HIA) as a means of safeguarding their obligations to protect human health under the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.
However, several have encountered difficulties institutionalizing HIA with the policy-making process.
As a consequence, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe has suggested coupling HIA with strategic environmental assessment (SEA).
Traditionally, the incorporation of HIA into other forms of impact assessment has been resisted, for fear of losing its focus on health issues to environmental concerns, and compromising its social model of health with the introduction of biophysical indicators.
But can these fears be substantiated?
In this paper, we investigate the grounds for such concerns by reviewing the relevant policy documents and departmental guidelines of four non-European countries that have considered the use of integrated assessment.
We found that the case for associating HIA with SEA in Europe is strong, and offers potential solutions to problems of screening, theoretical framework, causal pathways and ready entry to the policy process.
Coupling HIA with SEA may thus be the next step forward in a longer journey towards institutionalizing HIA as an independent policy-linked device.

Title
Field evaluation of a rapid, visually-read colloidal dye immunofiltration assay for Schistosoma japonicum for screening in areas of low transmission.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the validity of a recently developed rapid test - a colloidal dye immunofiltration assay (CDIFA) - used by health workers in field settings to identify villagers infected with Schistosoma japonicum.

METHODS
Health workers in the field used CDIFA to test samples from 1553 villagers in two areas of low endemicity and an area where S. japonicum was not endemic in Anhui, China.
All the samples were then tested in the laboratory by laboratory staff using a standard parasitological method (Kato-Katz), an indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA), and CDIFA.
The results of CDIFA performed by health workers were compared with those obtained by Kato-Katz and IHA.

FINDINGS
Concordance between the results of CDIFA performed in field settings and in the laboratory was high (kappa index, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.97).
When Kato-Katz was used as the reference test, the overall sensitivity and specificity of CDIFA were 98.5% and 83.6%, respectively in the two villages in areas of low endemicity, while the specificity was 99.8% in the non-endemic village.
Compared with IHA, the overall specificity and sensitivity of CDIFA were greater than 99% and 96%, respectively.
With the combination of Kato-Katz and IHA as the reference standard, CDIFA had a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 99.5%, and an accuracy of 98.6% in the two areas of low endemicity.

CONCLUSION
CDIFA is a specific, sensitive, and reliable test that can be used for rapid screening for schistosomiasis by health workers in field settings.

Title
Cost and results of information systems for health and poverty indicators in the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the costs of complementary information generation activities in a resource-constrained setting and compare the costs and outputs of information subsystems that generate the statistics on poverty, health and survival required for monitoring, evaluation and reporting on health programmes in the United Republic of Tanzania.

METHODS
Nine systems used by four government agencies or ministries were assessed.
Costs were calculated from budgets and expenditure data made available by information system managers.
System coverage, quality assurance and information production were reviewed using questionnaires and interviews.
Information production was characterized in terms of 38 key sociodemographic indicators required for national programme monitoring.

FINDINGS
In 2002-03 approximately US$ 0.53 was spent per Tanzanian citizen on the nine information subsystems that generated information on 37 of the 38 selected indicators.
The census and reporting system for routine health service statistics had the largest participating populations and highest total costs.
Nationally representative household surveys and demographic surveillance systems (which are not based on nationally representative samples) produced more than half the indicators and used the most rigorous quality assurance.
Five systems produced fewer than 13 indicators and had comparatively high costs per participant.

CONCLUSION
Policy-makers and programme planners should be aware of the many trade-offs with respect to system costs, coverage, production, representativeness and quality control when making investment choices for monitoring and evaluation.
In future, formal cost-effectiveness studies of complementary information systems would help guide investments in the monitoring, evaluation and planning needed to demonstrate the impact of poverty-reduction and health programmes.

Title
Reasons for attending dental-care services in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

OBJECTIVE
To determine why patients attend dental-care facilities in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso and to improve understanding of the capacity of oral health-care services in urban west Africa.

METHODS
We studied a randomly selected sample of patients attending 15 dental-care facilities in Ouagadougou over a 1-year period in 2004.
Data were collected using a simple daily record form.

FINDINGS
From a total of 44 975 patients, the final sample was established at 14 591 patients, of whom 55.4% were new patients and 44.6% were "booking patients".
Most patients seeking care (71.9%) were aged 15-44 years.
Nongovernmental not-for-profit dental services were used by 41.5% of all patients, 36% attended private dental-care services, and 22.5% of patients visited public services.
The most common complaint causing the patient to seek dental-care services was caries with pulpal involvement (52.4%), and 60% of all complaints were associated with pain.
The patients' dental-care requirements were found to differ significantly according to sex, health insurance coverage and occupation.

CONCLUSION
Urban district health authorities should ensure provision of primary health-care services, at the patients' first point of contact, which are directed towards the relief of pain.
In addition to the strengthening of outreach emergency care, health centres should also contribute to the implementation of community-based programmes for the prevention of oral disease and the promotion of oral health.
Exchange of experiences from alternative oral health-care systems relevant to developing countries is urgently needed for tackling the growing burden of oral disease.

Title
The global burden of oral diseases and risks to oral health.

Abstract
This paper outlines the burden of oral diseases worldwide and describes the influence of major sociobehavioural risk factors in oral health.
Despite great improvements in the oral health of populations in several countries, global problems still persist.
The burden of oral disease is particularly high for the disadvantaged and poor population groups in both developing and developed countries.
Oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal disease, tooth loss, oral mucosal lesions and oropharyngeal cancers, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS)-related oral disease and orodental trauma are major public health problems worldwide and poor oral health has a profound effect on general health and quality of life.
The diversity in oral disease patterns and development trends across countries and regions reflects distinct risk profiles and the establishment of preventive oral health care programmes.
The important role of sociobehavioural and environmental factors in oral health and disease has been shown in a large number of socioepidemiological surveys.
In addition to poor living conditions, the major risk factors relate to unhealthy lifestyles (i.e. poor diet, nutrition and oral hygiene and use of tobacco and alcohol), and limited availability and accessibility of oral health services.
Several oral diseases are linked to noncommunicable chronic diseases primarily because of common risk factors.
Moreover, general diseases often have oral manifestations (e.g. diabetes or HIV/AIDS).
Worldwide strengthening of public health programmes through the implementation of effective measures for the prevention of oral disease and promotion of oral health is urgently needed.
The challenges of improving oral health are particularly great in developing countries.

Title
Health-promoting schools: an opportunity for oral health promotion.

Abstract
Schools provide an important setting for promoting health, as they reach over 1 billion children worldwide and, through them, the school staff, families and the community as a whole.
Health promotion messages can be reinforced throughout the most influential stages of children's lives, enabling them to develop lifelong sustainable attitudes and skills.
Poor oral health can have a detrimental effect on children's quality of life, their performance at school and their success in later life.
This paper examines the global need for promoting oral health through schools.
The WHO Global School Health Initiative and the potential for setting up oral health programmes in schools using the health-promoting school framework are discussed.
The challenges faced in promoting oral health in schools in both developed and developing countries are highlighted.
The importance of using a validated framework and appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of school oral health projects is emphasized.

Title
Managing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) intellectual property rights: the possible role of patent pooling.

Abstract
Patent applications that incorporate the genomic sequence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, have been filed by a number of organizations.
This is likely to result in a fragmentation of intellectual property (IP) rights which in turn may adversely affect the development of products, such as vaccines, to combat SARS.
Placing these patent rights into a patent pool to be licensed on a non-exclusive basis may circumvent these difficulties and set a key precedent for the use of this form of mechanism in other areas of health care, leading to benefits to public health.

Title
Analysis of how the health systems context shapes responses to the control of human immunodeficiency virus: case-studies from the Russian Federation.

OBJECTIVE
To develop a methodology and an instrument that allow the simultaneous rapid and systematic examination of the broad public health context, the health care systems, and the features of disease-specific programmes.

METHODS
Drawing on methodologies used for rapid situational assessments of vertical programmes for tackling communicable disease, we analysed programmes for the control human of immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and their health systems context in three regions in the Russian Federation.
The analysis was conducted in three phases: first, analysis of published literature, documents and routine data from the regions; second, interviews with key informants, and third, further data collection and analysis.
Synthesis of findings through exploration of emergent themes, with iteration, resulted in the identification of the key systems issues that influenced programme delivery.

FINDINGS
We observed a complex political economy within which efforts to control HIV sit, an intricate legal environment, and a high degree of decentralization of financing and operational responsibility.
Although each region displays some commonalities arising from the Soviet traditions of public health control, there are considerable variations in the epidemiological trajectories, cultural responses, the political environment, financing, organization and service delivery, and the extent of multisectoral work in response to HIV epidemics.

CONCLUSION
Within a centralized, post-Soviet health system, centrally directed measures to enhance HIV control may have varying degrees of impact at the regional level.
Although the central tenets of effective vertical HIV programmes may be present, local imperatives substantially influence their interpretation, operationalization and effectiveness.
Systematic analysis of the context within which vertical programmes are embedded is necessary to enhance understanding of how the relevant policies are prioritized and translated to action.

Title
The geographical distribution of underweight children in Africa.

OBJECTIVE
To study geographical patterns of underweight children in Africa by combining information on prevalence with headcounts at a subnational level.

METHODS
We used large-scale, nationally representative nutrition surveys, in particular the Demographic and Health Surveys and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, which have been designed, analysed and presented according to largely similar protocols, and which report at the national and subnational levels.

FINDINGS
We found distinct geographical patterns in the occurrence of underweight children, which could be linked to factors such as agronomic and climatic conditions, population density and economic integration.

CONCLUSION
Patterns of underweight children cross national borders suggesting that regional characteristics and interactions need to be considered when addressing malnutrition.

Title
Investing in children's health: what are the economic benefits?.

Abstract
This paper argues that investing in children's health is a sound economic decision for governments to take, even if the moral justifications for such programmes are not considered.
The paper also outlines dimensions that are often neglected when public investment decisions are taken.
The conclusion that can be drawn from the literature studying the relationship between children's health and the economy is that children's health is a potentially valuable economic investment.
The literature shows that making greater investments in children's health results in better educated and more productive adults, sets in motion favourable demographic changes, and shows that safeguarding health during childhood is more important than at any other age because poor health during children's early years is likely to permanently impair them over the course of their life.
In addition, the literature confirms that more attention should be paid to poor health as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
Children born into poor families have poorer health as children, receive lower investments in human capital, and have poorer health as adults.
As a result, they will earn lower wages as adults, which will affect the next generation of children who will thus be born into poorer families.

Title
WHO study on Prevention of REcurrences of Myocardial Infarction and StrokE (WHO-PREMISE).

OBJECTIVE
To determine the extent of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in low- and middle-income countries.

METHODS
A descriptive cross-sectional survey of a sample of 10 000 CHD (85.2%) and CVD (14.8%) patients (6252 men; 3748 women) was conducted over 6 months in geographically defined areas.
The mean age was 59.2 years (standard deviation (SD), 10.8).
Consecutive patients were recruited from a stratified random sample of primary, secondary and tertiary care facilities in defined areas in 10 countries (Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Turkey).
The main outcome measures were levels of lifestyle and physiological risk factors, and the use of drugs for secondary prevention of CHD and CVD.

FINDINGS
Approximately 82%, 89% and 77% of patients were aware of the cardiovascular benefits of quitting smoking, a heart-healthy diet and regular physical activity, respectively.
About half (52.5%) engaged in less than 30 minutes of physical activity per day, 35% did not follow a heart-healthy diet and 12.5 % were current tobacco users.
Blood pressure had been measured in 93.8% (range 71-100%), blood cholesterol in 85.5% (range 29-97%) and blood sugar in 75.5% (range 65-99%) in the preceding 12 months.
The proportions who had received medications among CHD and CVD patients were: aspirin, 81.2%, 70.6%; beta-blockers, 48.1%, 22.8%; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 39.8%, 37.8%; statins, 29.8%, 14.1%, respectively.
About one-fifth of patients with CHD had undergone revascularization.

CONCLUSION
A significant proportion of patients did not receive appropriate medications.
About 47% of patients had at least two or more modifiable risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolaemia).
There are considerable missed opportunities for prevention of recurrences in those with established CVD in low- and middle-income countries.

Title
Socioeconomic inequality in infant mortality in Iran and across its provinces.

OBJECTIVE
To measure the socioeconomic inequality in infant mortality in Iran*.

METHODS
We analysed data from the provincially representative Demographic and Health Survey, which was done in Iran in 2000.
We used a dichotomous hierarchical ordered probit model to develop an indicator of socioeconomic status of households.
We assessed the inequality in infant mortality by using the odds ratio of infant mortality between the lowest and highest socioeconomic quintiles at both the provincial and national levels, and the concentration index, an inequality measure based on the entire socioeconomic distribution.

RESULTS
We found a decreasing trend in the infant mortality rate in relation to socioeconomic quintiles.
The poorest to richest odds ratio was 2.34 (95% CI = 1.78-3.09).
The concentration index of infant mortality in Iran was -0.1789 (95% CI = -0.2193--0.1386).
Furthermore, the inequality of infant mortality between the lowest and highest quintiles was significant and favoured the better-off in most of the provinces.
However, this inequality varied between provinces.

CONCLUSION
Socioeconomic inequality in infant mortality favours the better-off in the country as a whole and in most of its provinces, but the degree of this inequality varies between the provinces.
As well as its national average, it is important to consider the provincial distribution of this indicator of population health.

Title
A new definition of drowning: towards documentation and prevention of a global public health problem.

Abstract
Drowning is a major global public health problem.
Effective prevention of drowning requires programmes and policies that address known risk factors throughout the world.
Surveillance, however, has been hampered by the lack of a uniform and internationally accepted definition that permits all relevant cases to be counted.
To develop a new definition, an international consensus procedure was conducted.
Experts in clinical medicine, injury epidemiology, prevention and rescue from all over the world participated in a series of "electronic" discussions and face-to-face workshops.
The suitability of previous definitions and the major requirements of a new definition were intensely debated.
The consensus was that the new definition should include both cases of fatal and nonfatal drowning.
After considerable dialogue and debate, the following definition was adopted: "Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid."
Drowning outcomes should be classified as: death, morbidity, and no morbidity.
There was also consensus that the terms wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used.
Thus a simple, comprehensive, and internationally accepted definition of drowning has been developed.
Its use should support future activities in drowning surveillance worldwide, and lead to more reliable and comprehensive epidemiological information on this global, and frequently preventable, public health problem.

Title
Mapping the global distribution of trachoma.

OBJECTIVE
We aimed to summarize and map the existing global population-based data on active trachoma and trichiasis.
Detailed distribution maps of various infectious diseases have proved a valuable tool in their control.
Such maps play an important role in assessing the magnitude of the problem, defining priority areas for control, monitoring changes, and advocacy.
Until now, information on trachoma prevalence at within country levels has not been systematically collated, analysed and reported.

METHODS
We gathered the last 18 years' worth of reported data on active trachoma in children aged less than 10 years, and the last 25 years of reported trichiasis in adults aged 15 years and over from 139 population-based surveys in 33 countries.
We collated these data into one database using the "district" (second administrative level) as the standard unit of reporting.
We used Geographical Information Systems as a database and cartographic tool to generate a global map of the prevalence of trachoma and trichiasis.

FINDINGS
We obtained data on active trachoma and trichiasis from 18 countries in the WHO African Region, 6 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 3 in the South-East Asia Region, 3 in the Western Pacific Region and 2 in the Region of the Americas.
In 23 countries suspected of having endemic trachoma no reliable district-level population-based data were available.
In China and India, data were limited to a few districts.
The data highlighted important regional differences and marked national variations in prevalence of active trachoma and trichiasis.

CONCLUSION
This is the first attempt to summarize and map the existing population-based data on active trachoma and trichiasis.
The lack of data in many countries remains an important obstacle to trachoma control efforts.

Title
Global surveillance for chemical incidents of international public health concern.

OBJECTIVE
In December 2001, an expert consultation convened by WHO identified strengthening national and global chemical incident preparedness and response as a priority.
WHO is working towards this objective by developing a surveillance and response system for chemical incidents.
This report describes the frequency, nature and geographical location of acute chemical incidents of potential international concern from August 2002 to December 2003.

METHODS
Acute chemical incidents were actively identified through several informal (e.g. Internet-based resources) and formal (e.g. various networks of organizations) sources and assessed against criteria for public health emergencies of international concern using the then proposed revised International Health Regulations (IHR).
WHO regional and country offices were contacted to obtain additional information regarding identified incidents.

FINDINGS
Altogether, 35 chemical incidents from 26 countries met one or more of the IHR criteria.
The WHO European Region accounted for 43% (15/35) of reports.
The WHO Regions for Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific each accounted for 14% (5/35); South-East Asia and the Americas accounted for 9% (3/35) and 6% (2/35), respectively.
Twenty-three (66%) events were identified within 24 hours of their occurrence.

CONCLUSION
To our knowledge this is the first global surveillance system for chemical incidents of potential international concern.
Limitations such as geographical and language bias associated with the current system are being addressed.
Nevertheless, the system has shown that it can provide early detection of important events, as well as information on the magnitude and geographical distribution of such incidents.
It can therefore contribute to improving global public health preparedness.

Title
Exploiting the potential of vector control for disease prevention.

Abstract
Although vector control has proven highly effective in preventing disease transmission, it is not being used to its full potential, thereby depriving disadvantaged populations of the benefits of well tried and tested methods.
Following the discovery of synthetic residual insecticides in the 1940s, large-scale programmes succeeded in bringing many of the important vector-borne diseases under control.
By the late 1960s, most vector-borne diseases - with the exception of malaria in Africa - were no longer considered to be of primary public health importance.
The result was that control programmes lapsed, resources dwindled, and specialists in vector control disappeared from public health units.
Within two decades, many important vector-borne diseases had re-emerged or spread to new areas.
The time has come to restore vector control to its key role in the prevention of disease transmission, albeit with an increased emphasis on multiple measures, whether pesticide-based or involving environmental modification, and with a strengthened managerial and operational capacity.
Integrated vector management provides a sound conceptual framework for deployment of cost-effective and sustainable methods of vector control.
This approach allows for full consideration of the complex determinants of disease transmission, including local disease ecology, the role of human activity in increasing risks of disease transmission, and the socioeconomic conditions of affected communities.

Title
Catastrophic household expenditure for health care in a low-income society: a study from Nouna District, Burkina Faso.

OBJECTIVE
To quantify the extent of catastrophic household health care expenditure and determine the factors responsible for it in Nouna District, Burkina Faso.

METHODS
We used the Nouna Health District Household Survey to collect data on 800 households during 2000-01 for our analysis.
The determinants of household catastrophic expenditure were identified by multivariate logistic regression method.

FINDINGS
Even at very low levels of health care utilization and modest amount of health expenditure, 6-15% of total households in Nouna District incurred catastrophic health expenditure.
The key determinants of catastrophic health expenditure were economic status, household health care utilization especially for modern medical care, illness episodes in an adult household member and presence of a member with chronic illness.

CONCLUSION
We conclude that the poorest members of the community incurred catastrophic health expenses.
Setting only one threshold/cut-off value to determine catastrophic health expenses may result in inaccurate estimation leading to misinterpretation of important factors.
Our findings have important policy implications and can be used to ensure better access to health services and a higher degree of financial protection for low-income groups against the economic impact of illness.

Title
A sociodental approach to assessing children's oral health needs: integrating an oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) measure into oral health service planning.

OBJECTIVE
We adopted a sociodental approach to assess the real dental needs of Thai primary school children, and integrated an oral health-related quality of life measure (OHRQoL) into oral health service planning.
We then compared the results of this sociodental assessment with standard estimates of a child's oral health needs.

METHODS
We developed a new model of sociodental needs assessment and used it to assess the level of impact that various oral health conditions have on the everyday lives of school children.
We then carried out a cross-sectional study of all grade-6 children (11-12 years old) in Suphan-buri Province, Thailand.
We examined the sample (n = 1034) to assess the children's oral health and then we interviewed each child individually to assess what impact any dental conditions he or she may have on their quality of life.
This assessment was done using an OHRQoL indicator, the Child Oral Impacts on Daily Performances index (child-OIDP).
We integrated the results obtained using this indicator with those estimates obtained using more traditional, standard clinical methods, in order to generate a clearer picture of exactly which non-progressive dental conditions really needed treatment.
These results take into account the impact those conditions have on the overall well-being of children and their ability to function normally and unimpeded.
We were then able to prioritize their dental needs according to the severity of disruption caused in their daily lives.

FINDINGS
Using standard or "normative" estimates of dental health care needs, the children's need was 98.8%.
This level of need decreased signifi cantly to 39.5% when adopting the sociodental approach (P <0.001).
Overall, per 100 children with a standard or normative need for dental treatment, only 40 had a sociodental need for treatment when taking into account the impact their condition has on their everyday lives.
Children thus identifi ed as requiring treatment were further categorized according to the severity of impact their condition had: 7.2% had severe, 10.3% moderate and 22.0% had minor impacts on OHRQoL.

CONCLUSIONS
There was a marked difference between the standard normative and the sociodental needs assessment approach, with the latter approach showing a 60% lower assessment of dental health care needs in Thai 11-12-year-old children.
Different levels of "impacts" on daily life can be used to prioritize children with needs.

Title
Desperately seeking targets: the ethics of routine HIV testing in low-income countries.

Abstract
The human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) pandemic, and responses to it, have exposed clear political, social and economic inequities between and within nations.
The most striking manifestations of this inequity is access to AIDS treatment.
In affluent nations, antiretroviral treatment is becoming the standard of care for those with AIDS, while the same treatment is currently only available for a privileged few in most resource-poor countries.
Patients without sufficient financial and social capital - i.e., most people with AIDS - die each day by the thousands.
Recent AIDS treatment initiatives such as the UNAIDS and WHO "3 by 5" programme aim to rectify this symptom of global injustice.
However, the success of these initiatives depends on the identification of people in need of treatment through a rapid and massive scale-up of HIV testing.
In this paper, we briefly explore key ethical challenges raised by the acceleration of HIV testing in resource-poor countries, focusing on the 2004 policy of routine ("opt-out") HIV testing recommended by UNAIDS and WHO.
We suggest that in settings marked by poverty, weak health-care and civil society infrastructures, gender inequalities, and persistent stigmatization of people with HIV/AIDS, opt-out HIV-testing policies may become disconnected from the human rights ideals that first motivated calls for universal access to AIDS treatment.
We leave open the ethical question of whether opt-out policies should be implemented, but we recommend that whenever routine HIV-testing policies are introduced in resource-poor countries, that their effect on individuals and communities should be the subject of empirical research, human-rights monitoring and ethical scrutiny.

Title
Improving birth dose coverage of hepatitis B vaccine.

Abstract
Administration of a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB vaccine) to neonates is recommended to prevent mother-to-infant transmission and chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
Although manufacturers recommend HepB vaccine distribution and storage at 2-8 °C, recognition of the heat stability of hepatitis B surface antigen stimulated research into its use after storage at, or exposure to, ambient or high temperatures.
Storage of HepB vaccine at ambient temperatures would enable birth dosing for neonates delivered at home in remote areas or at health posts lacking refrigeration.
This article reviews the current evidence on the thermostability of HepB vaccine when stored outside the cold chain (OCC).
The reports reviewed show that the vaccines studied were safe and effective whether stored cold or OCC.
Field and laboratory data also verifies the retained potency of the vaccine after exposure to heat.
The attachment of a highly stable variety of a vaccine vial monitor (measuring cumulative exposure to heat) on many HepB vaccines strongly supports policies allowing their storage OCC, when this will benefit birth dose coverage.
We recommend that this strategy be introduced to improve birth dose coverage, especially in rural and remote areas.
Concurrent monitoring and evaluation should be undertaken to affirm the safe implementation of this strategy, and assess its cost, feasibility and effect on reducing HBV infection rates.
Meanwhile, release of manufacturer data verifying the potency of currently available HepB vaccines after exposure to heat will increase confidence in the use of vaccine vial monitors as a managerial tool during storage of HepB vaccine OCC.

Title
Effect of the HIV epidemic on infant feeding in South Africa: "When they see me coming with the tins they laugh at me".

OBJECTIVE
To explore how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has affected the infant-feeding experiences of HIV-positive mothers in South Africa.

METHODS
This was a qualitative interview study within a prospective cohort study.
We purposively selected a subsample of 40 women from a larger cohort of 650 HIV-positive mothers for in-depth interviews.

FINDINGS
The HIV epidemic has changed the context in which infant-feeding choices are made and implemented.
HIV-positive mothers in this study - who were predominantly young, single and unemployed - were struggling to protect their decision-making autonomy.
Uncertainty about the safety of breastfeeding has increased the power and influence of health workers, who now act as gatekeepers to not only this new knowledge but also to essential resources such as formula milk.
Fear of disclosure of HIV status and stigma has also weakened the ability of mothers to resist entrenched family and community norms that encourage early introduction of fluids and foods and that question non-breastfeeding.
Women who chose to exclusively formula feed had difficulties accessing formula milk because of inflexible policies and a lack of supplies at clinics.
Limited postpartum support led to social isolation and mothers doubting their ability to care for their children.

CONCLUSION
The infant-feeding experiences of HIV-positive mothers have serious implications for the operational effectiveness of programmes that aim to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child.
A better understanding of how HIV is changing infant-feeding practices can inform the development of interventions to improve infant-feeding counselling and postpartum support.

Title
District health programmes and health-sector reform: case study in the Lao People's Democratic Republic.

Abstract
The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is classified by the World Bank as a low-income country under stress.
Development partners have sought to utilize effective aid instruments to help countries classified in this way achieve the Millennium Development Goals; these aid instruments include sector-wide approaches (SWAps) that support decentralized district health systems and seek to avoid fragmentation and duplication.
In Asia and the Pacific, only Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have adopted SWAps.
Since 1991, a comprehensive primary health care programme in the remote Sayaboury Province of Lao PDR has focused on strengthening district health management, improving access to health facilities and responding to the most common causes of mortality and morbidity among women and children.
Between 1996 and 2003, health-facility utilization tripled, and the proportion of households that have access to a facility increased to 92% compared with only 61% nationally.
By 2003, infant and child mortality rates were less than one-third of the national rates.
The maternal mortality ratio decreased by 50% despite comprehensive emergency obstetric care not being available in most district hospitals.
These trends were achieved with an investment of approximately US$ 4 million over 12 years (equivalent to US$ 1.00 per person per year).
However, this project did not overcome weaknesses in some national disease-control programmes, especially the expanded programme on immunization, that require strong central management.
In Lao PDR, which is not yet committed to using SWAps, tools developed in Sayaboury could help other district health offices assume greater planning responsibilities in the recently decentralized system.
Development partners should balance their support for centrally managed disease-specific programmes with assistance to horizontally integrated primary health care at the district level.

Title
Monitoring the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy programmes: methods to estimate coverage.

Abstract
This paper reviews the data sources and methods used to estimate the number of people on, and coverage of, antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes in low- and middle-income countries and to monitor the progress towards the "3 by 5" target set by WHO and UNAIDS.
We include a review of the data sources used to estimate the coverage of ART programmes as well as the efforts made to avoid double counting and over-reporting.
The methods used to estimate the number of people in need of ART are described and expanded with estimates of treatment needs for children, both for ART and for cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.
An estimated 6.5 million people were in need of treatment in low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2004, including 660 000 children under age 15 years.
The mid-2005 estimate of 970 000 people receiving ART in low- and middle-income countries (with an uncertainty range 840 000-1 100 000) corresponds to a coverage of 15% of people in need of treatment.

Title
Cause-specific mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE
To provide internationally comparable data on the frequencies of different causes of death.

METHODS
We analysed verbal autopsies obtained during 1999 -2002 from 12 demographic surveillance sites in sub-Saharan Africa and Bangladesh to find cause-specific and age-specific mortality rates.
The cause-of-death codes used by the sites were harmonized to conform to the ICD-10 system, and summarized with the classification system of the Global Burden of Disease 2000 (Version 2).

FINDINGS
Causes of death in the African sites differ strongly from those in Bangladesh, where there is some evidence of a health transition from communicable to noncommunicable diseases, and little malaria.
HIV dominates in causes of mortality in the South African sites, which contrast with those in highly malaria endemic sites elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa (even in neighbouring Mozambique).
The contributions of measles and diarrhoeal diseases to mortality in sub-Saharan Africa are lower than has been previously suggested, while malaria is of relatively greater importance.

CONCLUSION
The different patterns of mortality we identified may be a result of recent changes in the availability and effectiveness of health interventions against childhood cluster diseases.

Title
Correcting for numerator/denominator bias when assessing changing inequalities in occupational class mortality, Australia 1981 -2002.

OBJECTIVE
Comparisons of the changing patterns of inequalities in occupational mortality provide one way to monitor the achievement of equity goals.
However, previous comparisons have not corrected for numerator/denominator bias, which is a consequence of the different ways in which occupational details are recorded on death certificates and on census forms.
The objective of this study was to measure the impact of this bias on mortality rates and ratios over time.

METHODS
Using data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we examined the evidence for bias over the period 1981 -2002, and used imputation methods to adjust for this bias.
We compared unadjusted with imputed rates of mortality for manual/non-manual workers.

FINDINGS
Unadjusted data indicate increasing inequality in the age-adjusted rates of mortality for manual/non-manual workers during 1981 -2002.
Imputed data suggest that there have been modest fluctuations in the ratios of mortality for manual/non-manual workers during this time, but with evidence that inequalities have increased only in recent years and are now at historic highs.

CONCLUSION
We found that imputation for missing data leads to changes in estimates of inequalities related to social class in mortality for some years but not for others.
Occupational class comparisons should be imputed or otherwise adjusted for missing data on census or death certificates.

Title
Making COD statistics useful for public health at local level in the city of Cape Town: utilidad para la salud pública a nivel local en Ciudad del Cabo.

OBJECTIVE
To review the quality of the coding of the cause of death (COD) statistics and assess the mortality information needs of the City of Cape Town.

METHODS
Using an action research approach, a study was set up to investigate the quality of COD information, the accuracy of COD coding and consistency of coding practices in the larger health subdistricts.
Mortality information needs and the best way of presenting the statistics to assist health managers were explored.

FINDINGS
Useful information was contained in 75% of death certificates, but nearly 60% had only a single cause certified; 55% of forms were coded accurately.
Disagreement was mainly because routine coders coded the immediate instead of the underlying COD.
An abridged classification of COD, based on causes of public health importance, prevalent causes and selected combinations of diseases was implemented with training on underlying cause.
Analysis of the 2001 data identified the leading causes of death and premature mortality and illustrated striking differences in the disease burden and profile between health subdistricts.

CONCLUSION
Action research is particularly useful for improving information systems and revealed the need to standardize the coding practice to identify underlying cause.
The specificity of the full ICD classification is beyond the level of detail on the death certificates currently available.
An abridged classification for coding provides a practical tool appropriate for local level public health surveillance.
Attention to the presentation of COD statistics is important to enable the data to inform decision-makers.

Title
Tracking progress towards the Millennium Development Goals: reaching consensus on child mortality levels and trends.

Abstract
The increased attention to tracking progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including Goal 4 of reducing child mortality, has drawn attention to a number of interrelated technical, operational and political challenges and to the underlying weaknesses of country health information systems upon which reliable monitoring depends.
Assessments of child mortality published in 2005, for almost all low-income countries, are based on an extrapolation of the trends observed during the 1990s, rather than on the empirical data for more recent years.
The validity of the extrapolation depends on the quality and quantity of the data used, and many countries lack suitable data.
In the long run, it is hoped that vital registration or sample registration systems will be established to monitor vital events in a sustainable way.
However, in the short run, tracking child mortality in high-mortality countries will continue to rely on household surveys and extrapolations of historical trends.
This will require more collaborative efforts both to collect data through initiatives to strengthen health information systems at the country level, and to harmonize the estimation process.
The latter objective requires the continued activity of a coordinating group of international agencies and academics that aims to produce transparent estimates- through the consistent application of an agreed-upon methodology- for monitoring at the international level.

Title
Patterns of hospital transfer for self-poisoned patients in rural Sri Lanka: implications for estimating the incidence of self-poisoning in the developing world.

OBJECTIVES
Most data on self-poisoning in rural Asia have come from secondary hospitals.
We aimed to: assess how transfers from primary to secondary hospitals affected estimates of case-fatality ratio (CFR); determine whether there was referral bias according to gender or poison; and estimate the annual incidence of all self-poisoning, and of fatal self-poisoning, in a rural developing-world setting.

METHODS
Self-poisoning patients admitted to Anuradhapura General Hospital, Sri Lanka, were reviewed on admission from 1 July to 31 December 2002.
We audited medical notes of self-poisoning patients admitted to 17 of the 34 surrounding peripheral hospitals for the same period.

FINDINGS
A total of 742 patients were admitted with self-poisoning to the secondary hospital; 81 died (CFR 10.9%).
483 patients were admitted to 17 surrounding peripheral hospitals.
Six patients (1.2%) died in peripheral hospitals, 249 were discharged home, and 228 were transferred to the secondary hospital.
There was no effect of gender or age on likelihood of transfer; however, patients who had ingested oleander or paraquat were more likely to be transferred than were patients who had taken organophosphorus pesticides or other poisons.
Estimated annual incidences of self-poisoning and fatal self-poisoning were 363 and 27 per 100 000 population, respectively, with an overall CFR of 7.4% (95% confidence interval 6.0-9.0).

CONCLUSION
Fifty per cent of patients admitted to peripheral hospitals were discharged home, showing that CFRs based on secondary hospital data are inflated.
However, while incidence of self-poisoning is similar to that in England, fatal self-poisoning is three times more common in Sri Lanka than fatal self-harm by all methods in England.
Population based data are essential for making international comparisons of case fatality and incidence, and for assessing public health interventions.

Title
A comparison of cluster and systematic sampling methods for measuring crude mortality.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the results of two different survey sampling techniques (cluster and systematic) used to measure retrospective mortality on the same population at about the same time.

METHODS
Immediately following a cluster survey to assess mortality retrospectively in a town in North Darfur, Sudan in 2005, we conducted a systematic survey on the same population and again measured mortality retrospectively.
This was only possible because the geographical layout of the town, and the availability of a good previous estimate of the population size and distribution, were conducive to the systematic survey design.

RESULTS
Both the cluster and the systematic survey methods gave similar results below the emergency threshold for crude mortality (0.80 versus 0.77 per 10 000/day, respectively).
The results for mortality in children under 5 years old (U5MR) were different (1.16 versus 0.71 per 10 000/day), although this difference was not statistically significant.
The 95% confidence intervals were wider in each case for the cluster survey, especially for the U5MR (0.15-2.18 for the cluster versus 0.09-1.33 for the systematic survey).

CONCLUSION
Both methods gave similar age and sex distributions.
The systematic survey, however, allowed for an estimate of the town's population size, and a smaller sample could have been used.
This study was conducted in a purely operational, rather than a research context.
A research study into alternative methods for measuring retrospective mortality in areas with mortality significantly above the emergency threshold is needed, and is planned for 2006.

Title
Preventable risk factors for noncommunicable diseases in rural Indonesia: prevalence study using WHO STEPS approach.

OBJECTIVE
To gain a better understanding of the health transition in Indonesia, we sought to describe the prevalence and distribution of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and to identify the risk-factor burden among a rural population and an urban population.

METHODS
Using the protocol of the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS), risk factors for noncommunicable diseases were determined for 1502 men and 1461 women aged 15-74 years at the Purworejo Demographic Surveillance Site in 2001.

FINDINGS
Smoking prevalence was high among men (913/1539; weighted percentage = 53.9.%) in both rural and urban populations; it was almost non-existent among women.
A higher proportion of the urban population and the richest quintile of the rural population had high blood pressure and were classified as being overweight or obese when compared with the poorest quintile of the rural population.
Those classified as being in the richest quintile who lived in the rural area were 1.5 times more likely to have raised blood pressure and 8 times more likely to be overweight than those classified as being in the poorest quintile and living in the rural area.
Clustering of risk factors was higher among those classified as being in the richest quintile of those living in the rural area compared with those classified as being in the poorest quintile; and the risks of clustering were just 20-30% lower compared with the urban population.

CONCLUSION
Both the rural and urban populations in Purworejo face an unequally distributed burden of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases.
The burden among the most well-off group in the rural area has already reached a level similar to that found in the urban area.
The implementation of the WHO STEPS approach was feasible, and it provides a comprehensive picture of the burden of risk factors, allowing appropriate health interventions to be implemented to address health inequities.

Title
Supervision, monitoring and evaluation of nationwide scale-up of antiretroviral therapy in Malawi.

OBJECTIVE
To describe the supervision, monitoring and evaluation strategies used to assess the delivery of antiretroviral therapy during nationwide scale-up of treatment in Malawi.

METHODS
In the first quarter of 2005, the HIV Unit of the Ministry of Health and its partners (the Lighthouse Clinic; Médecins Sans Frontières-Belgium, Thyolo district; and WHO's Country Office) undertook structured supervision and monitoring of all public sector health facilities in Malawi delivering antiretroviral therapy.

FINDINGS
Data monitoring showed that by the end of 2004, there were 13 183 patients (5274 (40%) male, 12 527 (95%) adults) who had ever started antiretroviral therapy.
Of patients who had ever started, 82% (10 761/13 183) were alive and taking antiretrovirals; 8% (1026/13 183) were dead; 8% (1039/13 183) had been lost to follow up; < 1% (106/13 183) had stopped treatment; and 2% (251/13 183) had transferred to another facility.
Of those alive and on antiretrovirals, 98% (7098/7258) were ambulatory; 85% (6174/7258) were fit to work; 10% (456/4687) had significant side effects; and, based on pill counts, 96% (6824/7114) had taken their treatment correctly.
Mistakes in the registration and monitoring of patients were identified and corrected.
Drug stocks were checked, and one potential drug stock-out was averted.
As a result of the supervisory visits, by the end of March 2005 recruitment of patients to facilities scheduled to start delivering antiretroviral therapy had increased.

CONCLUSION
This report demonstrates the importance of early supervision for sites that are starting to deliver antiretroviral therapy, and it shows the value of combining data collection with supervision.
Making regular supervisory and monitoring visits to delivery sites are essential for tracking the national scale-up of delivery of antiretrovirals.

Title
Benchmarking progress in tackling the challenges of intellectual property, and access to medicines in developing countries.

Abstract
The impact of intellectual property protection in the pharmaceutical sector on developing countries has been a central issue in the fierce debate during the past 10 years in a number of international fora, particularly the World Trade Organization (WTO) and WHO.
The debate centres on whether the intellectual property system is: (1) providing sufficient incentives for research and development into medicines for diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries; and (2) restricting access to existing medicines for these countries.
The Doha Declaration was adopted at WTO in 2001 and the Commission on Intellectual Property, Innovation and Public Health was established at WHO in 2004, but their respective contributions to tackling intellectual property-related challenges are disputed.
Objective parameters are needed to measure whether a particular series of actions, events, decisions or processes contribute to progress in this area.
This article proposes six possible benchmarks for intellectual property-related challenges with regard to the development of medicines and ensuring access to medicines in developing countries.

Title
Choosing the right incentive strategy for research and development in neglected diseases.

Abstract
For the first time in history, worldwide neglected disease budgets may be large enough to deliver a new drug every few years.
That said, sponsors will only succeed if they extract maximum value from every dollar spent.
This paper reviews possible cost-containment strategies and provides an evidence-based framework for choosing between them.
Current proposals can be categorized as "end-to-end" proposals which require the sponsor to set a single reward for companies that complete the entire drug discovery process or "pay-as-you-go" schemes in which sponsors offer repeated rewards as drug candidates progress through the pipeline.
A generic weakness of end-to-end proposals is that rewards are likely to be 20-30% higher than they would be in an equivalent pay-as-you-go programme.
However, the benefits of pay-as-you-go programmes may be lost if commercial pharmaceutical companies are substantially better at choosing successful programmes than are their non-profit counterparts.
The efficiency of pay-as-you-go methods depends on sponsors’ willingness to withdraw funding from failed drug discovery programmes.

Title
The pricing and procurement of antiretroviral drugs: an observational study of data from the Global Fund.

Abstract
The Purchase price report released in August 2004 by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) was the first publication of a significant amount of real transaction purchase data for antiretrovirals (ARVs).
We did an observational study of the ARV transaction data in the Purchase price report to examine the procurement behaviour of principal recipients of Global Fund grants in developing countries.
We found that, with a few exceptions for specific products (e.g. lamivudine) and regions (e.g. eastern Europe), prices in low-income countries were broadly consistent or lower than the lowest differential prices quoted by the research and development sector of the pharmaceutical industry.
In lower middle-income countries, prices were more varied and in several instances (lopinavir/ritonavir, didanosine, and zidovudine/lamivudine) were very high compared with the per capita income of the country.
In all low- and lower middle-income countries, ARV prices were still significantly high given limited local purchasing power and economic strength, thus reaffirming the need for donor support to achieve rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy.
However, the price of ARVs will have to decrease to render scale-up financially sustainable for donors and eventually for governments themselves.
An important first step in reducing prices will be to make available in the public domain as much ARV transaction data as possible to provide a factual basis for discussions on pricing.
The price of ARVs has considerable implications for the sustainability of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) treatment in the developing world.

Title
Cross-sectional associations between intensity of animal and human infection with Schistosoma japonicum in Western Samar province, Philippines.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the association between the intensity of animal infection with Schistosoma japonicum and human infection in Western Samar province, the Philippines.

METHODS
We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of 1425 households in 50 villages.
Stool samples were collected on each of 1-3 days from 5623 humans, 1275 cats, 1189 dogs, 1899 pigs, 663 rats and 873 water buffalo.
Intensity of infection with S. japonicum was measured by the number of eggs per gram (EPG).
Egg counts were done using the Kato-Katz method.
We used a Bayesian hierarchical cumulative logit model, with adjustments for age, sex, occupation and measurement error.

FINDINGS
The adjusted proportions of humans lightly infected (classified as 1-100 EPG) was 17.7% (95% Bayesian credible interval = 15.3-20.2%); the proportion classified as at least moderately infected (>100 EPG) was 3.2% (2.2-4.6%).
The crude parasitological results for animals indicated that 37 cats (2.9%), 228 dogs (19.2%), 39 pigs (2.1%), 199 rats (30.0%) and 28 water buffalo (3.2%) were infected.
In univariate analyses the odds ratios corresponding to a unit increase in the mean number of EPG at the village-level in dogs was 1.05 (1.01-1.09), in cats 1.35 (1.02-1.78), in pigs 1.16 (0.24- 5.18) and in rats 1.00 (1.00-1.01).
Mean EPG values in cats, dogs, pigs and rats were correlated with one another.
This confounding made interpreting the odds ratios difficult, but the odds ratios for dogs and cats were more consistent.

CONCLUSION
S. japonicum is endemic in areas of the Philippines despite implementation of control programmes.
This may be due to the association of infections in dogs and cats with human infections.
Infection control in dogs and cats is challenging, and there is a need to develop new methods to control transmission across all species.

Title
Methods for establishing a surveillance system for cardiovascular diseases in Indian industrial populations.

OBJECTIVE
To establish a surveillance network for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors in industrial settings and estimate the risk factor burden using standardized tools.

METHODS
We conducted a baseline cross-sectional survey (as part of a CVD surveillance programme) of industrial populations from 10 companies across India, situated in close proximity to medical colleges that served as study centres.
The study subjects were employees (selected by age and sex stratified random sampling) and their family members.
Information on behavioural, clinical and biochemical determinants was obtained through standardized methods (questionnaires, clinical measurements and biochemical analysis).
Data collation and analyses were done at the national coordinating centre.

FINDINGS
We report the prevalence of CVD risk factors among individuals aged 20-69 years (n = 19 973 for the questionnaire survey, n = 10 442 for biochemical investigations); mean age was 40 years.
The overall prevalence of most risk factors was high, with 50.9% of men and 51.9% of women being overweight, central obesity was observed among 30.9% of men and 32.8% of women, and 40.2% of men and 14.9% of women reported current tobacco use.
Self-reported prevalence of diabetes (5.3%) and hypertension (10.9%) was lower than when measured clinically and biochemically (10.1% and 27.7%, respectively).
There was marked heterogeneity in the prevalence of risk factors among the study centres.

CONCLUSION
There is a high burden of CVD risk factors among industrial populations across India.
The surveillance system can be used as a model for replication in India as well as other developing countries.

Title
Turning liabilities into resources: informal village doctors and tuberculosis control in Bangladesh.

Abstract
In 1998, the Damien Foundation Bangladesh invited semi-qualified, private "gram dakter" (Bangla for "village doctors") to participate in tuberculosis (TB) programmes in a population of 26 million people in rural Bangladesh.
The organization trained 12 525 village doctors to not only refer suspected TB cases for free diagnosis but also to provide directly observed treatment (DOT) free of charge.
Source of referral and place of DOT was recorded as part of the standardized TB recording and reporting system, which enabled us to quantify the contribution of village doctors to case detection rates and also allowed disaggregated cohort analysis of treatment outcome.
During 2002 and 2003, 11% of all TB cases with positive sputum smears in the study area had been referred by village doctors; the rate of positive tests in patients referred by village doctors was 14.4%.
18 792 patients received DOT from village doctors, accounting for between 20% and 45% of patients on treatment during the 1998-2003 period.
The treatment success rate was about 90% throughout the period.
Urine samples taken during random checks of treatment compliance were positive for isoniazid in 98% of patients treated by village doctors.
Within the framework of Public-Private Mix DOTS, services provided by semi-qualified private health care providers are a feasible and effective way to improve access to affordable high quality TB treatment in poor rural populations.
The large informal health workforce that exists in resource poor countries can be used to achieve public health goals.
Involvement of village doctors in TB control has now become national policy in Bangladesh.

Title
Setting the stage for equity-sensitive monitoring of the maternal and child health Millennium Development Goals.

OBJECTIVE
This analysis seeks to set the stage for equity-sensitive monitoring of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

METHODS
We use data from international household-level surveys (Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS)) to demonstrate that establishing an equity baseline is necessary and feasible, even in low-income and data-poor countries.
We assess data from six countries using 11 health indicators and six social stratifiers.
Simple bivariate stratification is complemented by simultaneous stratification to expose the compound effect of multiple forms of vulnerability.

FINDINGS
The data reveal that inequities are complex and interactive: inferences cannot be drawn about the nature or extent of inequities in health outcomes from a single stratifier or indicator.

CONCLUSION
The MDGs and other development initiatives must become more comprehensive and explicit in their analysis and tracking of inequities.
The design of policies to narrow health gaps must take into account country-specific inequities.

Title
HIV testing in national population-based surveys: experience from the Demographic and Health Surveys.

OBJECTIVES
To describe the methods used in the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to collect nationally representative data on the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and assess the value of such data to country HIV surveillance systems.

METHODS
During 2001-04, national samples of adult women and men in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Mali, Kenya, United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia were tested for HIV.
Dried blood spot samples were collected for HIV testing, following internationally accepted ethical standards.
The results for each country are presented by age, sex, and urban versus rural residence.
To estimate the effects of non-response, HIV prevalence among non-responding males and females was predicted using multivariate statistical models for those who were tested, with a common set of predictor variables.

RESULTS
Rates of HIV testing varied from 70% among Kenyan men to 92% among women in Burkina Faso and Cameroon.
Despite large differences in HIV prevalence between the surveys (1-16%), fairly consistent patterns of HIV infection were observed by age, sex and urban versus rural residence, with considerably higher rates in urban areas and in women, especially at younger ages.
Analysis of non-response bias indicates that although predicted HIV prevalence tended to be higher in non-tested males and females than in those tested, the overall effects of non-response on the observed national estimates of HIV prevalence are insignificant.

CONCLUSIONS
Population-based surveys can provide reliable, direct estimates of national and regional HIV seroprevalence among men and women irrespective of pregnancy status.
Survey data greatly enhance surveillance systems and the accuracy of national estimates in generalized epidemics.

Title
Mortality of tuberculosis patients in Chennai, India.

OBJECTIVE
We aimed to measure the mortality rate and excess general mortality as well as identify groups at high risk for mortality among a cohort of tuberculosis patients treated in Chennai Corporation clinics in south India.

METHODS
In this retrospective cohort study we followed up 2674 patients (1800 males and 874 females) who were registered and treated under the DOTS strategy in Chennai Corporation clinics in 2000.
The follow-up period from the date of start of treatment to either the date of interview, or death was 600 days.

FINDINGS
The mortality rate among this cohort of tuberculosis patients was 60/1000 person-years.
The excess general mortality expressed as standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 6.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.4-6.9).
Younger patients, men, patients with Category II disease, patients who defaulted on, or failed courses of treatment, and male smokers who were alcoholics, all had higher mortality ratios when compared to the rest of the cohort.

CONCLUSION
The excess mortality in this cohort was six times more than that in the general population.
Young age, male sex, smear-positivity, treatment default, treatment failure and the combination of smoking and alcoholism were identified as risk factors for tuberculosis mortality.
We suggest that mortality rate and excess mortality be routinely used as a monitoring tool for evaluating the efficiency of the national control programme.

Title
Diagnostic tests in HIV management: a review of clinical and laboratory strategies to monitor HIV-infected individuals in developing countries.

Abstract
We conducted a systematic review on the performance of diagnostic tests for clinical and laboratory monitoring of HIV-infected adults in developing countries.
Diagnostic test information collected from computerized databases, bibliographies and the Internet were categorized as clinical (non-laboratory patient information), immunologic (information from immunologic laboratory tests), or virologic (information from virologic laboratory tests).
Of the 51 studies selected for the review 28 assessed immunologic tests, 12 virologic tests and seven clinical and immunologic tests.
Methods of performance evaluation were primarily sensitivity and specificity for the clinical category and correlation coefficients for immunologic and virologic categories.
In the clinical category, the majority of test performance measures was reported as >70% sensitive and >65% specific.
In the immunologic category, correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.54 to r = 0.99 for different CD4 count enumeration techniques, while correlation for CD4 and total lymphocyte counts was between r = 0.23 and r = 0.74.
In the virologic category, correlation coefficients for different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) quantification techniques ranged from r = 0.54 to r = 0.90.
Future research requires consensus on designing studies, and collecting and reporting data useful for decision-makers.
We recommend classifying information into clinically relevant categories, using a consistent definition of disease across studies and providing measures of both association and accuracy.

Title
Bridging the gap between knowledge and action for health: case studies.

Abstract
Biomedical discoveries could improve people's health only if they are suited to the diverse political and social contexts, health systems and population groups.
Knowledge generated through evidence-informed health policy and practice when applied to the local situation enhances the quality and efficiency of health care.
This article describes four case studies on bridging the gap between knowledge and action for health in a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.
Gaps between knowledge and action for health are classified into "know-do" and "do-know" gaps with knowledge implementation and knowledge generation being the key measures for bridging the gap.

Title
Linking local knowledge with global action: examining the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria through a knowledge system lens.

Abstract
New global public health institutions are increasingly emphasizing transparency in decision-making, developing-country ownership of projects and programmes, and merit- and performance-based funding.
Such principles imply an institutional response to the challenge of bridging the "know-do gap", by basing decisions explicitly on results, evidence and best practice.
Using a knowledge systems framework, we examine how the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has affected the ways in which knowledge is used in efforts to combat these three diseases.
We outline the formal knowledge system embedded in current rules and practices associated with the Global Fund's application process, and give three examples that illustrate the complexity of the knowledge system in action: human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) policy in China; successful applications from Haiti; and responses to changing research on malaria.
These examples show that the Global Fund has created strong incentives for knowledge to flow to local implementers, but with little encouragement and few structures for the potentially valuable lessons from implementation to flow back to global best practice or research-based knowledge.
The Global Fund could play an influential role in fostering much-needed learning from implementation.
We suggest that three initial steps are required to start this process: acknowledging shared responsibility for learning across the knowledge system; analysing the Global Fund's existing data (and refining data collection over time); and supporting recipients and technical partners to invest resources in linking implementation with best practice and research.

Title
Systematic reviews and knowledge translation.

Abstract
Proven effective interventions exist that would enable all countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals.
However, uptake and use of these interventions in the poorest populations is at least 50% less than in the richest populations within each country.
Also, we have recently shown that community effectiveness of interventions is lower for the poorest populations due to a "staircase" effect of lower coverage/access, worse diagnostic accuracy, less provider compliance and less consumer adherence.
We propose an evidence-based framework for equity-oriented knowledge translation to enhance community effectiveness and health equity.
This framework is represented as a cascade of steps to assess and prioritize barriers and thus choose effective knowledge translation interventions that are tailored for relevant audiences (public, patient, practitioner, policy-maker, press and private sector), as well as the evaluation, monitoring and sharing of these strategies.
We have used two examples of effective interventions (insecticide-treated bednets to prevent malaria and childhood immunization) to illustrate how this framework can provide a systematic method for decision-makers to ensure the application of evidence-based knowledge in disadvantaged populations.
Future work to empirically validate and evaluate the usefulness of this framework is needed.
We invite researchers and implementers to use the cascade for equity-oriented knowledge translation as a guide when planning implementation strategies for proven effective interventions.
We also encourage policy-makers and health-care managers to use this framework when deciding how effective interventions can be implemented in their own settings.

Title
Leading a change process to improve health service delivery.

Abstract
In the fields of health and development, donors channel multiple resources into the design of new practices and technologies, as well as small-scale programmes to test them.
But successful practices are rarely scaled up to the level where they beneficially impact large, impoverished populations.
An effective process for change is to use the experiences of new practices gained at the programme level for full-scale implementation.
To make an impact, new practices need to be applied, and supported by management systems, at many organizational levels.
At every level, potential implementers and likely beneficiaries must first recognize some characteristics that would benefit them in the new practices.
An effective change process, led by a dedicated internal change agent, comprises several well-defined phases that successively broaden and institutionalize the use of new practices.

Title
Creating windows of opportunity for policy change: incorporating evidence into decentralized planning in Kenya.

PROBLEM
Because researchers and policy-makers work in different spheres, policy decisions in the health arena are often not based on available scientific evidence.

APPROACH
We describe a model that illustrates the policy process and how to work strategically to translate knowledge into policy actions.
Several types of activity - agenda-setting, coalition building and policy learning - together can create a window of opportunity for policy change.

LOCAL SETTING
Activities were undertaken as part of the Kenyan Ministry of Health's new decentralized planning-process.
The objective was to ensure that the results of a national assessment of health services were used in the preparation of district-level health plans.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Following the intervention, 70 district-level, evidence-based work plans were developed and approved by the Kenyan Ministry of Health.

LESSONS LEARNED
Substantial investment and effort are needed to bring stakeholders together to work towards policy change.
More in-depth evaluation of these efforts can aid understanding of how systematic approaches to policy change can be replicated elsewhere.

Title
Measuring the impact of intimate partner violence on the health of women in Victoria, Australia.

OBJECTIVE
Using burden of disease methodology, estimate the health risks of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women in Victoria, Australia.

METHODS
We calculated population attributable fractions (from survey data on the prevalence of IPV and the relative risks of associated health problems in Australia) and determined health outcomes by applying them to disability-adjusted life year estimates for the relevant disease and injury categories for Victoria, Australia for 2001.

FINDINGS
For women of all ages IPV accounted for 2.9% (95% uncertainty interval 2.4-3.4%) of the total disease and injury burden.
Among women 18-44 years of age, IPV was associated with 7.9% (95% uncertainty interval 6.4-9.5%) of the overall disease burden and was a larger risk to health than risk factors traditionally included in burden of disease studies, such as raised blood pressure, tobacco use and increased body weight.
Poor mental health contributed 73% and substance abuse 22% to the disease burden attributed to IPV.

CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that IPV constitutes a significant risk to women's health.
Mental health policy-makers and health workers treating common mental health problems need to be aware that IPV is an important risk factor.
Future research should concentrate on evaluating effective interventions to prevent women being exposed to violence, and identifying the most appropriate mental health care for victims to reduce short- and long-term disability.

Title
Can public-private collaboration promote tuberculosis case detection among the poor and vulnerable?.

Abstract
Private-public mix (PPM) DOTS is widely advocated as a DOTS adaptation for promoting progress towards the international tuberculosis (TB) control targets of detecting 70% of TB cases and successfully treating 85% of these.
Private health care plays a central role in health-care provision in many developing countries that have a high burden of TB.
It is therefore encouraging that PPM projects are being set up in various countries around the world to explore possible interaction between the national TB programmes and other partners in the fight against TB.
The objective of this review was to use the published literature to assess the range of providers included in PPMs for their ability to provide case-detection services for the vulnerable.
From a case-detection perspective, we identify the essential elements of a pro-poor PPM model, namely, cost-effectiveness from a patient perspective, accessibility, acceptability and quality.
The review revealed that a very large part of the total spectrum of potential PPM-participating partners has not yet been explored; current models focus on private-for-profit health-care providers and nongovernmental organizations.
We conclude that it is important to think critically about the type of private providers who are best suited to meeting the needs of the poor, and that more should be done to document the socioeconomic status of patients accessing services through PPM pilots.

Title
Ten-year health service use outcomes in a population-based cohort of 21 000 injured adults: the Manitoba Injury Outcome Study.

OBJECTIVE
To quantify long-term health service use (HSU) following non-fatal injury in adults.

METHODS
A retrospective, population-based, matched cohort study identified an inception cohort (1988-91) of injured people who had been hospitalized (ICD-9-CM 800-995) aged 18-64 years (n = 21 032) and a matched non-injured comparison group (n = 21 032) from linked administrative data from Manitoba, Canada.
HSU data (on hospitalizations, cumulative length of stay, physician claims and placements in extended care services) were obtained for the 12 months before and 10 years after the injury.
Negative binomial and Poisson regressions were used to quantify associations between injury and long-term HSU.

FINDINGS
Statistically significant differences in the rates of HSU existed between the injured and non-injured cohorts for the pre-injury year and every year of the follow-up period.
After controlling for pre-injury HSU, the attributable risk percentage indicated that 38.7% of all post-injury hospitalizations (n = 25 183), 68.9% of all years spent in hospital (n = 1031), 21.9% of physician claims (n = 269 318) and 77.1% of the care home placements (n = 189) in the injured cohort could be attributed to being injured.

CONCLUSION
Many people who survive the initial period following injury, face long periods of inpatient care (and frequent readmissions), high levels of contact with physicians and an increased risk of premature placement in institutional care.
Population estimates of the burden of injury could be refined by including long-term non-fatal health consequences and controlling for the effect of pre-injury comorbidity.

Title
Hard gains through soft contracts: productive engagement of private providers in tuberculosis control.

Abstract
Over the past decade, there has been a rapid increase in the number of initiatives involving "for-profit" private health care providers in national tuberculosis (TB) control efforts.
We reviewed 15 such initiatives with respect to contractual arrangements, quality of care and success achieved in TB control.
In seven initiatives, the National TB Programme (NTP) interacted directly with for-profit providers; while in the remaining eight, the NTP collaborated with for-profit providers through intermediary not-for-profit nongovernmental organizations.
All but one of the initiatives used relational "drugs-for-performance contracts" to engage for-profit providers, i.e. drugs were provided free of charge by the NTP emphasizing that providers dispense them free of charge to patients and follow national guidelines for diagnosis and treatment.
We found that 90% (range 61-96%) of new smear-positive pulmonary TB cases were successfully treated across all initiatives and TB case detection rates increased between 10% and 36%.
We conclude that for-profit providers can be effectively involved in TB control through informal, but well defined drugs-for-performance contracts.
The contracting party should be able to reach a common understanding concerning goals and role division with for-profit providers and monitor them for content and quality.
Relational drugs-for-performance contracts minimize the need for handling the legal and financial aspects of classical contracting.
We opine that further analysis is required to assess if such "soft" contracts are sufficient to scale up private for-profit provider involvement in TB control and other priority health interventions.

Title
Public-private partnerships for hospitals.

Abstract
While some forms of public-private partnerships are a feature of hospital construction and operation in all countries with mixed economies, there is increasing interest in a model in which a public authority contracts with a private company to design, build and operate an entire hospital.
Drawing on the experience of countries such as Australia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, this paper reviews the experience with variants of this model.
Although experience is still very limited and rigorous evaluations lacking, four issues have emerged: cost, quality, flexibility and complexity.
New facilities have, in general, been more expensive than they would have been if procured using traditional methods.
Compared with the traditional system, new facilities are more likely to be built on time and within budget, but this seems often to be at the expense of compromises on quality.
The need to minimize the risk to the parties means that it is very difficult to "future-proof" facilities in a rapidly changing world.
Finally, such projects are extremely, and in some cases prohibitively, complex.
While it is premature to say whether the problems experienced relate to the underlying model or to their implementation, it does seem that a public-private partnership further complicates the already difficult task of building and operating a hospital.

Title
Knowledge gaps in scientific literature on maternal mortality: a systematic review.

Abstract
Issues related to maternal mortality have generated a lot of empirical and theoretical information.
However, despite the amount of work published on the topic, maternal mortality continues to occur at high rates and solutions to the problem are still not clear.
Scientific research on maternal mortality is focused mainly on clinical factors.
However, this approach may not be the most useful if we are to understand the problem of maternal mortality as a whole and appreciate the importance of economical, political and social macrostructural factors.
In this paper, we report the number of scientific studies published between 2000 and 2004 about the main causes of maternal death, as identified by WHO, and compare the proportion of papers on each cause with the corresponding burden of each cause.
Secondly, we systematically review the characteristics and quality of the papers on the macrostructural determinants of maternal mortality.
In view of their burden, obstructed labour, unsafe abortion and haemorrhage are proportionally underrepresented in the scientific literature.
In our review, most studies analysed were cross-sectional, and were carried out by developed countries without the participation of researchers in the developing countries where maternal mortality was studied.
The main macrostructural factors mentioned were socioeconomic variables.
Overall, there is a lack of published information about the cultural and political determinants of maternal mortality.
We believe that a high-quality scientific approach must be taken in studies of maternal mortality in order to obtain robust comparative data and that study design should be improved to allow causality between macrostructural determinants and maternal mortality to be shown.

Title
Mental illness and suicidality after Hurricane Katrina.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the impact of Hurricane Katrina on mental illness and suicidality by comparing results of a post-Katrina survey with those of an earlier survey.

METHODS
The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, conducted between February 2001 and February 2003, interviewed 826 adults in the Census Divisions later affected by Hurricane Katrina.
The post-Katrina survey interviewed a new sample of 1043 adults who lived in the same area before the hurricane.
Identical questions were asked about mental illness and suicidality.
The post-Katrina survey also assessed several dimensions of personal growth that resulted from the trauma (for example, increased closeness to a loved one, increased religiosity).
Outcome measures used were the K6 screening scale of serious mental illness and mild-moderate mental illness and questions about suicidal ideation, plans and attempts.

FINDINGS
Respondents to the post-Katrina survey had a significantly higher estimated prevalence of serious mental illness than respondents to the earlier survey (11.3% after Katrina versus 6.1% before; c²1= 10.9; P < 0.001) and mild-moderate mental illness (19.9% after Katrina versus 9.7% before; c²1 = 22.5; P < 0.001).
Among respondents estimated to have mental illness, though, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and plans was significantly lower in the post-Katrina survey (suicidal ideation 0.7% after Katrina versus 8.4% before; c²1 = 13.1; P < 0.001; plans for suicide 0.4% after Katrina versus 3.6% before; c²1 = 6.0; P = 0.014).
This lower conditional prevalence of suicidality was strongly related to two dimensions of personal growth after the trauma (faith in one's own ability to rebuild one's life, and realization of inner strength), without which between-survey differences in suicidality were insignificant.

CONCLUSION
Despite the estimated prevalence of mental illness doubling after Hurricane Katrina, the prevalence of suicidality was unexpectedly low.
The role of post-traumatic personal growth in ameliorating the effects of trauma-related mental illness on suicidality warrants further investigation.

Title
Preventing vertical transmission of HIV in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo: a baseline survey of 18 antenatal clinics.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the content and delivery of essential antenatal services before implementation of programmes for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

METHODS
We assessed 18 antenatal care centres (eight public units and ten managed by nongovernmental organizations) in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
We used a survey to capture information about the number and type of antenatal health workers, infrastructure capacity and the delivery of basic antenatal care services such as: nutritional counselling; tetanus toxoid vaccination; prevention and management of anaemia, malaria, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis; and counselling for postpartum contraception.

FINDINGS
Antenatal care units differed with respect to size, capacity, cost, service delivery systems and content.
For instance, 17 of the 18 sites offered anaemia screening but only two sites included the cost in the card that gives access to antenatal care.
Nine of the clinics (50%) reported providing the malaria prophyalxis sulfadoxine pyrimethamine as per national policy.
Four (22%) of the sites offered syphilis screening.

CONCLUSION
Scaling up PMTCT programmes in under-resourced settings requires evaluation and strengthening of existing basic antenatal care service delivery.

Title
Assessing the burden of injury in six European countries.

OBJECTIVE
To assess injury-related mortality, disability and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in six European countries.

METHODS
Epidemiological data (hospital discharge registers, emergency department registers, mortality databases) were obtained for Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom (England and Wales).
For each country, the burden of injury was estimated in years lost due to premature mortality (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and DALYs (per 1000 persons).

FINDINGS
We observed marked differences in the burden of injury between countries.
Austria lost the largest number of DALYs (25 per 1000 persons), followed by Denmark, Norway and Ireland (17-20 per 1000 persons).
In the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the total burden due to injuries was relatively low (12 per 1000 persons).
The variation between countries was attributable to a high variation in premature mortality (YLL varied from 9-17 per 1000 persons) and disability (YLD varied from 2-8 per 1000 persons).
In all countries, males aged 25-44 years represented one third of the total injury burden, mainly due to traffic and intentional injuries.
Spinal cord injury and skull-brain injury resulted in the highest burden due to permanent disability.

CONCLUSION
The burden of injury varies considerably among the six participating European countries, but males aged 15-24 years are responsible for a disproportionate share of the assessed burden of injury in all countries.
Consistent injury control policy is supported by high-quality summary measures of population health.
There is an urgent need for standardized data on the incidence and functional consequences of injury.

Title
Diarrhoea case management in low- and middle-income countries: an unfinished agenda.

OBJECTIVE
To ascertain whether diarrhoea management improved during 1986-2003, a period when significant efforts were made to promote effective case management in children.

METHODS
We analysed household data from 107 Demographic and Health Surveys in 40 low- and middle-income countries from 1986 to 2003 and assessed trends in indicators of rehydration, fluid quantity and food intake in children with diarrhoea.
A statistical analysis was made of the overall trend for each indicator.

FINDINGS
Modest progress was made with regard to the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) (0.39% per year) and increased fluid intake (1.02% per year), and use rates remained low in 2003, when compared with desired full coverage.
Although use rates improved in the majority of countries, no progress was made in several countries.
We estimate that, annually, 307 million children in low- and middle-income countries did not receive ORT, 356 million did not get increased amounts of fluids, and at the beginning of the 21st century, 227 million children got neither ORT nor increased amounts of fluids.

CONCLUSION
The finding that many children in low- and middle-income countries do not receive proper treatment for diarrhoea points to the urgency in addressing this unfinished agenda in child survival.
The effectiveness of diarrhoea control needs to be improved after critical review of established approaches and activities to reach caregivers of children at risk of dying from diarrhoeal diseases.
Significant efforts must be made to scale up activities to improve case management and reduce childhood deaths from diarrhoea.

Title
Ensuring access to HPV vaccines through integrated services: a reproductive health perspective.

Abstract
In 2006, a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was licensed, and another vaccine may be licensed soon.
Little is known about the practical considerations involved in designing and implementing cervical cancer prevention programmes that include vaccination as a primary means of prevention.
Although the vaccine may ultimately be indicated for both males and females, young girls, or girls and women aged 9-25 years, will be the initial candidates for the vaccine.
This paper describes avenues for service delivery of HPV vaccines and critical information gaps that must be bridged in order to inform future sexual and reproductive health programming.
It proposes the role that the sexual and reproductive health community, together with immunization and cancer control programmes, could have in supporting the introduction of HPV vaccines within the context of current health systems.

Title
Impact of a national helminth control programme on infection and morbidity in Ugandan schoolchildren.

OBJECTIVE
We aimed to assess the health impact of a national control programme targeting schistosomiasis and intestinal nematodes in Uganda, which has provided population-based anthelmintic chemotherapy since 2003.

METHODS
We conducted longitudinal surveys on infection status, haemoglobin concentration and clinical morbidity in 1871 randomly selected schoolchildren from 37 schools in eight districts across Uganda at three time points - before chemotherapy and after one year and two years of annual mass chemotherapy.

FINDINGS
Mass treatment with praziquantel and albendazole led to a significant decrease in the intensity of Schistosoma mansoni - 70% (95% confidence interval (CI): 66-73%) after one year and 82% (95% CI: 80-85%) after two years of treatment.
Intensity of hookworm infection also decreased (75% and 93%; unadjusted).
There was a significant increase in haemoglobin concentration after one (0.135 g/dL (95% CI: 0.126-0.144)) and two years (0.303 g/dL (95% CI: 0.293-0.312)) of treatment, and a significant decrease in signs of early clinical morbidity.
The impact of intervention on S. mansoni prevalence and intensity was similar to that predicted by mathematical models of the impact of chemotherapy on human schistosomiasis.
Improvements in haemoglobin concentration were greatest among children who were anaemic or harbouring heavy S. mansoni infection at baseline.

CONCLUSION
Anthelmintic treatment delivered as part of a national helminth control programme can decrease infection and morbidity among schoolchildren and improve haemoglobin concentration.

Title
Output-based payment to boost staff productivity in public health centres: contracting in Kabutare district, Rwanda.

OBJECTIVE
In many low-income countries, public health systems do not meet the needs and demands of the population.
We aimed to assess the extent to which output-based payment could boost staff productivity at health care facilities.

METHODS
We assessed the performance of 15 health care centres in Kabutare, Rwanda, comparing productivity in 2001, when fixed annual bonuses were paid to staff, with that in 2003, when an output-based payment incentive scheme was implemented.

FINDINGS
Changes to the structure of contracts were associated with improvements in health centre performance: specifically, output-based performance contracts induced sharp increases in the productivity of health staff.

CONCLUSION
Institutional configurations of health care organizations deserve more attention.
Those currently in place in the public sector may not the most suitable to meet current challenges in health care.
More experiments are needed to confirm these early results from Rwanda and elsewhere, since risks associated with output-based incentive schemes should not be ignored.

Title
Flows of financial resources for health research and development in Brazil, 2000-2002.

OBJECTIVE
To map and measure the flows of financial resources for health research and development in Brazil for the years 2000-2002.

METHODS
After adapting the methodology developed for the Center for Economic Policy Research, data were collected on the sources and uses of resources for health research and development.

RESULTS
The annual average value of resources apportioned to health research and development was approximately US$ 573 million.
The public sector as a whole invested US$ 417.3 million and the health department US$ 51.1 million.
Expressed in percentages, the public sector invested 4.15% of the health department's budget although the Ministry of Health assigned only 0.3% of its budget to health research in the country.
The universities and the research institutes are the main users of the resources allocated to health research and development, receiving 91.6% of the total public spending, while the private sector receives a small share of around 0.69% of the total.
The private sector invested US$ 135.6 million per year, and the international organizations US$ 20.1 million per year.

CONCLUSION
Besides measuring the financial resources made available for health research and development, the results allowed the filling of gaps in national information; the identification of the flows of applied financial resources; and the testing and adaptation of the proposed methodology, generating information suitable for international comparisons.

Title
Vector control complements mass drug administration against bancroftian filariasis in Tirukoilur, India.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the role of vector control in further decreasing the transmission of bancroftian filariasis achieved by mass drug administration and the long-term impact on filariometric indices.

METHODS
Three rounds of annual mass drug administration, with diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin, were complemented by vector control (mainly using polystyrene beads) in villages of Tirukoilur, south India, during 1995-99.
Subsequently, drug administration is being carried out with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole or diethylcarbamazine alone.
We evaluated the impact of mass drug administration used alone or in conjunction with vector control (from 1995 to 2005) on vector transmission indices (such as transmission intensity index, monthly biting rate, monthly transmission potential and annual transmission potential).
We analysed data on filarial infection in the community to estimate the prevalence of microfilaraemia and antigenaemia using c2 analysis and Fisher's exact test.

FINDINGS
Vector density greatly decreased in villages where vector control was used as an adjunct to mass drug administration and almost no infective mosquitoes were found in the small numbers still remaining.
Filarial antigenaemia was low and continued to decrease significantly in the age group 15-25 years in villages receiving mass drug administration with vector control in contrast to villages receiving only mass drug administration.

CONCLUSION
The gains of mass drug administration were sustained only with the integration of vector control measures.
We advocate the incorporation of vector control in the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis as it can potentially decrease the time required for eliminating lymphatic filariasis.

Title
Bridging health and foreign policy: the role of health impact assessments.

Abstract
Health impact assessment (HIA) is an important tool for exploring the intersection between health and foreign policy, offering a useful analytical approach to increase positive health impacts and minimize negative impacts.
Numerous subject areas have brought health and foreign policy together.
Yet further opportunities exist for HIA to address a broader range of health impacts that otherwise may not be seen as relevant to foreign policy.
HIA may also improve the quality of scientific evidence available to policy-makers.
The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control offers lessons for the strategic use of HIA.
However, HIA alone is limited in influencing these decision-making processes, notably when issues diverge from other core concerns such as economics and security.
In such cases, HIA is an important tool to be used alongside the mobilization of key constituencies and public support.

Title
Tsunami mortality in Aceh Province, Indonesia.

OBJECTIVE
Nine tsunami-affected districts in Aceh, Indonesia, were surveyed between February and August 2005 to characterize tsunami mortality.

METHODS
The surveys employed a two-stage cluster methodology with probability proportional to size sampling, and encompassed 1653 tsunami-displaced households with a pre-tsunami population of 10 063 individuals.

FINDINGS
Of the original pre-tsunami population, a total of 1642 people, or 17%, were reported as dead or missing in the tsunami.
Crude mortality rates in the four survey areas ranged from a high of 23.6% in Aceh Jaya district on the west coast to 5.3% on the east coast.
Age-specific mortality rates followed a similar pattern across the four survey areas, with the highest mortality concentrating in the youngest children (aged 0-9 years) and oldest adults (70+).
The risk of mortality was significantly greater among females than males; this difference was most pronounced among individuals between ages 10 and 69 years, and diminished among younger and older age groups.

CONCLUSION
Mortality risk in the 2004 Asian tsunami varied by geographic location, age and sex.
The districts of Aceh Jaya, Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar experienced the greatest mortality.
Risk of death was highest among females, and among the oldest and youngest population subgroups.
While the full human impact of the Asian tsunami in Aceh Province, in terms of lives lost or damaged, may never be fully measured, the resulting female deficit will likely be the tsunami's most deeply felt and prolonged impact.

Title
The Global Drug Facility: a unique, holistic and pioneering approach to drug procurement and management.

Abstract
In January 2006, the Stop TB Partnership launched the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015, which describes the actions and resources needed to reduce tuberculosis (TB) incidence, prevalence and deaths.
A fundamental aim of the Global Plan is to expand equitable access to affordable high-quality anti-tuberculous drugs and diagnostics.
A principal tool developed by the Stop TB Partnership to achieve this is the Global Drug Facility (GDF).
This paper demonstrates the GDF's unique, holistic and pioneering approach to drug procurement and management by analysing its key achievements.
One of these has been to provide 9 million patient-treatments to 78 countries in its first 6 years of operation.
The GDF recognized that the incentives provided by free or affordable anti-tuberculosis drugs are not sufficient to induce governments to improve their programmes' standards and coverage, nor does the provision of free or affordable drugs guarantee that there is broad access to, and use of, drug treatment in cases where procurement systems are weak, regulatory hurdles exist or there are unreliable distribution and storage systems.
Thus, the paper also illustrates how the GDF has contributed towards making sustained improvements in the capacity of countries worldwide to properly manage their anti-TB drugs.
This paper also assesses some of the limitations, shortcomings and risks associated with the model.
The paper concludes by examining the GDF's key plans and strategies for the future, and the challenges associated with implementation.

Title
Reaching the global tuberculosis control targets in the Western Pacific Region.

PROBLEM
In 1999, a tuberculosis (TB) crisis was declared in the Western Pacific Region.

APPROACH
In response, WHO established the Stop TB Special Project, which sought to halve 2000 levels of TB prevalence and mortality by 2010 through first reaching the global 2005 TB targets.

LOCAL SETTING
Particular issues in the region were low political commitment, inadequate numbers of staff (particularly of adequately trained staff) and a wide variation in TB burden between countries.

RELEVANT CHANGES
WHO's leadership (especially the commitment of its Regional Director) and building of regional and national partnerships strengthened political and donor commitment.
This accelerated the implementation of regional and national TB control plans, allowing the region to reach the 2005 targets for TB control.

LESSONS LEARNED
The experience in the Western Pacific Region demonstrated that WHO's leadership was pivotal in generating the political commitment necessary to accelerate actions on the ground.
The region's investment in building partnerships and a motivated workforce was an important contribution towards achieving the 2005 global TB targets.

Title
Targets for tuberculosis control: how confident can we be about the data?.

Abstract
The targets of tuberculosis (TB) control programmes are to detect 70% of new sputum smear-positive cases of TB and to cure 85% of these.
The Stop TB Partnership has set additional targets related to the Millennium Development Goals: to halve TB prevalence and mortality between 1990 and 2015.
This paper assesses how confident we can be about the data on TB case detection, cure rates, prevalence and mortality.
Countries were grouped into those with good, limited or poor information on the burden of TB (based on notification data, population surveys and vital registration systems).
Of 211 countries with a total population of 6.4 billion and an estimated 8.9 million cases of TB, 27 countries with a total population of 2.2 billion and an estimated 1.8 million cases of TB had estimates based on good information (i.e. a good-quality surveillance system detecting > 70% of all cases, or a good-quality TB prevalence survey).
Of the 22 countries with a high burden of TB and bearing 80% of the global burden, none had a good surveillance system in 1997.
Vital registration systems were good in 81 countries with a total population of 2.7 billion.
This paper suggests that globally and in the 22 countries with a high burden of TB there is considerable uncertainty about indicators to measure progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.
Routine surveillance and vital registration systems need to be strengthened.
We recommend that national TB prevalence surveys be performed in selected high-burden countries, in Africa in particular.

Title
Barriers to reaching the targets for tuberculosis control: multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

Abstract
The development and expansion of WHO's DOTS strategy was successful, with 83% of the world's population living in countries or parts of countries covered by this strategy by the end of 2004.
Treatment success in the 2003 DOTS cohort of 1.7 million patients was 82% on average, close to the 85% target.
Treatment success was below average in the African Region (72%), which can be partly attributed to occurrence of HIV co-infection, and in the European Region (75%), partly due to drug resistance.
Drug resistance, specifically multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance, is a serious threat to public health in all countries, especially in the Russian Federation, where the highest rates of multidrug resistance are presently accompanied by a rapid increase in HIV infection.
Based on the experience of the first projects approved by the Green Light Committee, the treatment success of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is lower than that of drug-susceptible cases, but nevertheless reaches 70%.
The collaborative effort of different organizations, professionals and communities is needed to address the development and spread of multidrug resistance and extensive drug resistance, which combined with the epidemic of HIV infection is one of the barriers to dealing effectively with TB.
This effort should be directed towards facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of TB patients, in particular by improving access to drug susceptibility testing and strengthening treatment delivery by rigorous adherence to DOTS as outlined by the Stop TB Partnership.

Title
Can non-physician health-care workers assess and manage cardiovascular risk in primary care?.

OBJECTIVE
To ascertain the reliability of applying the WHO Cardiovascular Risk Management Package by non-physician health-care workers (NPHWs) in typical primary health-care settings.

METHODS
Based on an a priori 80% agreement level between the NPHWs and the "expert" physicians (gold standard), 649 paired (matched) applications of the protocol were obtained for analysis using Kappa statistic and multivariate logit regression.

FINDINGS
Results indicate over 80% agreement between raters, from moderate to perfect levels of agreement in almost all of the sections in the package.
The odds of obtaining a difference between raters and a benchmark are not statistically significant.

CONCLUSION
Applying the WHO Cardiovascular Risk Management Package, NPHWs can be retrained to reliably and effectively assess and manage cardiovascular risks in primary health-care settings where there are no attending physicians.
The package could be a useful tool for scaling up the management of cardiovascular diseases in primary health care.

Title
An evaluation of infant immunization in Africa: is a transformation in progress?.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the progress made towards meeting the goals of the African Regional Strategic Plan of the Expanded Programme on Immunization between 2001 and 2005.

METHODS
We reviewed data from national infant immunization programmes in the 46 countries of WHO's African Region, reviewed the literature and analysed existing data sources.
We carried out face-to-face and telephone interviews with relevant staff members at regional and subregional levels.

FINDINGS
The African Region fell short of the target for 80% of countries to achieve at least 80% immunization coverage by 2005.
However, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-3 coverage increased by 15%, from 54% in 2000 to 69% in 2004.
As a result, we estimate that the number of nonimmunized children declined from 1.4 million in 2002 to 900 000 in 2004.
In 2004, four of seven countries with endemic or re-established wild polio virus had coverage of 50% or less, and some neighbouring countries at high risk of importation did not meet the 80% vaccination target.
Reported measles cases dropped from 520 000 in 2000 to 316 000 in 2005, and mortality was reduced by approximately 60% when compared to 1999 baseline levels.
A network of measles and yellow fever laboratories had been established in 29 countries by July 2005.

CONCLUSION
Rates of immunization coverage are improving dramatically in the WHO African Region.
The huge increases in spending on immunization and the related improvements in programme performance are linked predominantly to increases in donor funding.

Title
Operational effectiveness of single-dose nevirapine in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the operational effectiveness of the South African programme for preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in reducing rates of early transmission of infection.

METHODS
Participants were mother-infant pairs who participated in the South African PMTCT programme between October 2002 and November 2004.
This was a prospective cohort study.
Three sites in different provinces were selected to represent differences in socioeconomic status and HIV prevalence.
Data on antenatal care and labour ward care were obtained from maternal interviews and from reviews of medical records.
A total of 665 mother-infant pairs in which the mother was HIV-positive were recruited and 588 (88.4%) were followed up at 3 or 4 weeks postpartum to determine the HIV status and vital status of the infant.

FINDINGS
Rural participants were significantly poorer and their health care was significantly worse.
Women of higher socioeconomic status and those who received better counselling were more likely to be treated with nevirapine.
Rates of early HIV transmission ranged from 8.6% to 13.7%.
Maternal viral load was the only statistically significant risk factor for transmission.
After adjusting for maternal viral load and prevalence of low birth weight, the odds of transmission were 1.8 times higher at the rural site.
Controlling for having had > 4 antenatal visits and any delivery complication reduced the odds of transmission to 1.5 higher at the rural site.

CONCLUSION
Rates of early transmission of HIV in an operational setting using single-dose nevirapine administered both to mother and child are similar to those obtained in clinical trials.
Scaling up access to antiretroviral regimens for women will further reduce transmission to infants.

Title
Understanding the community impact of lymphatic filariasis: a review of the sociocultural literature.

Abstract
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic in approximately 80 tropical and subtropical countries.
About 120 million people are infected with the parasite and a billion are estimated to be at risk of infection.
The main focus of the LF elimination programme to date has been to interrupt transmission by means of annual community-wide treatment campaigns with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole, or albendazole and ivermectin, for a period of four to six years.
Although substantial progress has been recorded wherever the strategy has been successfully implemented, initial gains have been accompanied by a realization that this strategy alone will not ensure a permanent solution in all settings.
The fairly extensive LF literature is dominated by laboratory research and quantitative field measurement of the impact of LF, particularly local prevalence studies of parasite-infected humans and vectors.
As the global elimination programme expands, the absence of sociocultural understanding is being recognized as a critical flaw in ensuring that programmes are appropriate and responsive to local needs and understanding.
This paper assesses the current state of sociocultural understanding pertaining to LF.
It concludes that, at present, there is insufficient understanding of the sociocultural factors associated with the presence and treatment of the disease, and that appropriate social science methods should be used to address this deficiency and ensure community partnership in delivering and sustaining the success of LF elimination programmes.

Title
Population-based evidence of a strong decline in the prevalence of smokers in Brazil (1989-2003).

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the evolution in smoking indicators in the adult Brazilian population between 1989 and 2003.

METHODS
We compared age-adjusted prevalence ratios and means for smoking indicators, stratified by age, sex and sociodemographic variables, obtained from two comparable household surveys that used probabilistic sampling of the Brazilian population aged > 18 years (n = 34 808 in 1989 and n = 5000 in 2003).

FINDINGS
Between 1989 and 2003, there was a substantial decrease in the prevalence of smoking (from 34.8% to 22.4%; age-adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.60-0.70) and a modest reduction in the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day (from 13.3 to 11.6; age-adjusted difference, -1.8; 95% CI, -2.6 - -1.0).
Reductions in the prevalence and intensity of smoking were greater among males, younger age groups and higher socioeconomic strata.

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of smoking in the adult Brazilian population declined by 35% between 1989 and 2003, or an average of 2.5% per year.
This exceptional reduction surpasses those seen in other countries that implemented wide-ranging and rigorous policies for controlling smoking during the same period.
The more intense decline in smoking in younger age groups was consistent with the concentration of efforts of the Brazilian tobacco control programme to prevent the onset of smoking among youths and the total prohibition of cigarette advertising.
We recommend the intensification of programme initiatives targeting women and less economically favoured population strata.

Title
Antiretroviral treatment roll-out in a resource-constrained setting: capitalizing on nursing resources in Botswana.

PROBLEM
As programmes to deliver antiretroviral therapy (ART) are implemented in resource-constrained settings, the problem becomes not how these programmes are going to be financed but who will be responsible for delivering and sustaining them.

APPROACH
Physician-led models of HIV treatment and care that have evolved in industrialized countries are not replicable in settings with a high prevalence of HIV infection and limited access to medical staff.
Therefore, models of care need to make better use of available human resources.

LOCAL SETTING
Using Botswana as an example, we discuss how nurses are underutilized in long-term clinical management of patients requiring ART.

RELEVANT CHANGES
We argue that for ART-delivery programmes to be sustainable, nurses will need to provide a level of clinical care for patients receiving this therapy, including prescribing ART and managing common adverse effects.

LESSONS LEARNED
Practicalities involved in scaling up nurse-led models of ART delivery include overcoming political and professional barriers, identifying educational requirements, agreeing on the limitations of nursing practice, developing clear referral pathways between medical and nursing personnel, and developing mechanisms to monitor and supervise practice.
Operational research is required to demonstrate that such models are safe, effective and sustainable.

Title
Mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1964-2004.

OBJECTIVE
Reliable information on the pattern, level and trend of mortality is essential for evidence-based policy to improve health.
Various sources of mortality data in the Islamic Republic of Iran have not been critically assessed.
This paper aims to document and evaluate the completeness of the different data sources on mortality and to estimate the level and trends of mortality over the past 40 years according to various mortality indices such as child mortality, adult mortality and life expectancy.

METHODS
We undertook a systematic review of all available studies on infant mortality from 1964 to 2004 and estimated the most probable trend in child mortality.
Death registration data from between 1992 and 2004 were assessed for completeness to estimate the level of adult mortality.
Life tables for 2004 were constructed for the Islamic Republic of Iran based on these data, corrected for underregistration of death.

FINDINGS
Infant mortality decreased from an estimated 154 deaths per 1000 live births in 1964 to 26 in 2004.
The risk of adult mortality in 2004 was estimated to be 0.124 and 0.175 for females and males respectively.
According to adjusted death registration data, life expectancy at birth in 2004 was 71.2 for females and 68.7 for males.
The average completeness of death registration for ages 5 years and older across all systems was 76% for the period 2001-2004.

CONCLUSION
There has been a general decline in child mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran over the past three decades.
Adult mortality levels also have declined, but less substantially.
Mortality information systems have improved, yet serious concerns remain regarding the completeness and quality of data.

Title
Development of a WHO growth reference for school-aged children and adolescents.

OBJECTIVE
To construct growth curves for school-aged children and adolescents that accord with the WHO Child Growth Standards for preschool children and the body mass index (BMI) cut-offs for adults.

METHODS
Data from the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference (1-24 years) were merged with data from the under-fives growth standards' cross-sectional sample (18-71 months) to smooth the transition between the two samples.
State-of-the-art statistical methods used to construct the WHO Child Growth Standards (0-5 years), i.e. the Box-Cox power exponential (BCPE) method with appropriate diagnostic tools for the selection of best models, were applied to this combined sample.

FINDINGS
The merged data sets resulted in a smooth transition at 5 years for height-for-age, weight-for-age and BMI-for-age.
For BMI-for-age across all centiles the magnitude of the difference between the two curves at age 5 years is mostly 0.0 kg/m2 to 0.1 kg/m2.
At 19 years, the new BMI values at +1 standard deviation (SD) are 25.4 kg/m2 for boys and 25.0 kg/m2 for girls.
These values are equivalent to the overweight cut-off for adults (> 25.0 kg/m2).
Similarly, the +2 SD value (29.7 kg/m2 for both sexes) compares closely with the cut-off for obesity (> 30.0 kg/m2).

CONCLUSION
The new curves are closely aligned with the WHO Child Growth Standards at 5 years, and the recommended adult cut-offs for overweight and obesity at 19 years.
They fill the gap in growth curves and provide an appropriate reference for the 5 to 19 years age group.

Title
Elevated blood-lead levels among children living in the rural Philippines.

OBJECTIVE
Generally, lead poisoning is not considered a significant environmental hazard for children in rural areas of developing countries.
With a prospectively designed policy experiment, the research community and the government are conducting a broad-based investigation to introduce and evaluate the impact of health policy reforms on children in a rural area of the Philippines - the Quality Improvement Demonstration Study (QIDS).
As part of this study, we researched lead exposure in children under the age of five.

METHODS
We sampled a population of children from the Visayas region in the central Philippines, covering approximately one third of the country's geographical area.
From December 2003 to September 2004, the survey collected blood lead levels (BLL) together with demographic, socioeconomic and child health data points.
Supplemental field-testing among a sub-sample of the most exposed children assessed the sources of environmental lead exposure.

FINDINGS
Among children in this study, 21% (601 of 2861 children) had BLL greater than10 µg/dl.
BLL were associated independently with age, haemoglobin concentration, water source, roofing material, expenditures and history of breastfeeding.
A follow-up assessment of possible environmental exposures among the sub-sample of children with elevated BLL revealed no single or predominant exposure source.
Instead, there appear to be multiple potential sources, such as fossil-fuel combustion, lead paint (in or around 38% of homes) and household items.

CONCLUSION
Elevated BLL are common among children in the Visayas, and may signify an under-recognized threat to children living in rural areas of other developing nations.
This setting has varied environmental sources of lead.
Observed correlates of BLL may be of clinical, environmental and public health utility to identify and mitigate the consequences of lead toxicity.

Title
Barriers to successful tuberculosis treatment in Tomsk, Russian Federation: non-adherence, default and the acquisition of multidrug resistance.

OBJECTIVE
To identify barriers to successful tuberculosis (TB) treatment in Tomsk, Siberia, by analysing individual and programmatic risk factors for non-adherence, default and the acquisition of multidrug resistance in a TB treatment cohort in the Russian Federation.

METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutively enrolled, newly detected, smear and/or culture-positive adult TB patients initiating therapy in a DOTS programme in Tomsk between 1 January and 31 December 2001.

FINDINGS
Substance abuse was strongly associated with non-adherence [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 7.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.89-18.46] and with default (adjusted OR: 11.2; 95% CI: 2.55-49.17).
Although non-adherence was associated with poor treatment outcomes (OR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5), it was not associated with the acquisition of multi-drug resistance during the course of therapy.
Patients who began treatment in the hospital setting or who were hospitalized later during their treatment course had a substantially higher risk of developing multidrug-resistant TB than those who were treated as outpatients (adjusted HRs: 6.34; 95% CI: 1.35-29.72 and 6.26; 95% CI: 1.02-38.35 respectively).

CONCLUSION
In this cohort of Russian TB patients, substance abuse was a strong predictor of non-adherence and default.
DOTS programmes may benefit from incorporating measures to diagnose and treat alcohol misuse within the medical management of patients undergoing TB therapy.
Multidrug-resistant TB occurred among adherent patients who had been hospitalized in the course of their therapy.
This raises the possibility that treatment for drug-sensitive disease unmasked a pre-existing population of drug-resistant organisms, or that these patients were reinfected with a drug-resistant strain of TB.

Title
Human papillomavirus and HPV vaccines: a review.

Abstract
Cervical cancer, the most common cancer affecting women in developing countries, is caused by persistent infection with "high-risk" genotypes of human papillomaviruses (HPV).
The most common oncogenic HPV genotypes are 16 and 18, causing approximately 70% of all cervical cancers.
Types 6 and 11 do not contribute to the incidence of high-grade dysplasias (precancerous lesions) or cervical cancer, but do cause laryngeal papillomas and most genital warts.
HPV is highly transmissible, with peak incidence soon after the onset of sexual activity.
A quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) HPV vaccine has recently been licensed in several countries following the determination that it has an acceptable benefit/risk profile.
In large phase III trials, the vaccine prevented 100% of moderate and severe precancerous cervical lesions associated with types 16 or 18 among women with no previous infection with these types.
A bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine has also undergone extensive evaluation and been licensed in at least one country.
Both vaccines are prepared from non-infectious, DNA-free virus-like particles produced by recombinant technology and combined with an adjuvant.
With three doses administered, they induce high levels of serum antibodies in virtually all vaccinated individuals.
In women who have no evidence of past or current infection with the HPV genotypes in the vaccine, both vaccines show > 90% protection against persistent HPV infection for up to 5 years after vaccination, which is the longest reported follow-up so far.
Vaccinating at an age before females are exposed to HPV would have the greatest impact.
Since HPV vaccines do not eliminate the risk of cervical cancer, cervical screening will still be required to minimize cancer incidence.
Tiered pricing for HPV vaccines, innovative financing mechanisms and multidisciplinary partnerships will be essential in order for the vaccines to reach populations in greatest need.

Title
Huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care: an international comparative study of maternity and child care in developing countries.

OBJECTIVE
Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals for maternal health has been slow, and accelerated progress in scaling up professional delivery care is needed.
This paper describes poor-rich inequalities in the use of maternity care and seeks to understand these inequalities through comparisons with other types of health care.

METHODS
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 45 developing countries were used to describe poor-rich inequalities by wealth quintiles in maternity care (professional delivery care and antenatal care), full childhood immunization coverage and medical treatment for diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).

FINDINGS
Poor-rich inequalities in maternity care in general, and professional delivery care in particular, are much greater than those in immunization coverage or treatment for childhood illnesses.
Public-sector inequalities make up a major part of the poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery attendance.
Even delivery care provided by nurses and midwives favours the rich in most countries.
Although poor-rich inequalities within both rural and urban areas are large, most births without professional delivery care occur among the rural poor.

CONCLUSION
Poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care are much larger than those in the other forms of care.
Reducing poor-rich inequalities in professional delivery care is essential to achieving the MDGs for maternal health.
The greatest improvements in professional delivery care can be made by increasing coverage among the rural poor.
Problems with availability, accessibility and affordability, as well as the nature of the services and demand factors, appear to contribute to the larger poor-rich inequalities in delivery care.
A concerted effort of equity-oriented policy and research is needed to address the huge poor-rich inequalities in maternity care.

Title
Did the strategy of skilled attendance at birth reach the poor in Indonesia?.

OBJECTIVE
To assess whether the strategy of "a midwife in every village" in Indonesia achieved its aim of increasing professional delivery care for the poorest women.

METHODS
Using pooled Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data from 1986-2002, we examined trends in the percentage of births attended by a health professional and deliveries via caesarean section.
We tested for effects of the economic crisis of 1997, which had a negative impact on Indonesia's health system.
We used logistic regression, allowing for time-trend interactions with wealth quintile and urban/rural residence.

FINDINGS
There was no change in rates of professional attendance or caesarean section before the programme's full implementation (1986-1991).
After 1991, the greatest increases in professional attendance occurred among the poorest two quintiles - 11% per year compared with 6% per year for women in the middle quintile (P = 0.02).
These patterns persisted after the economic crisis had ended.
In contrast, most of the increase in rates of caesarean section occurred among women in the wealthiest quintile.
Rates of caesarean deliveries remained at less than 1% for the poorest two-fifths of the population, but rose to 10% for the wealthiest fifth.

CONCLUSION
The Indonesian village midwife programme dramatically reduced socioeconomic inequalities in professional attendance at birth, but the gap in access to potentially life-saving emergency obstetric care widened.
This underscores the importance of understanding the barriers to accessing emergency obstetric care and of the ways to overcome them, especially among the poor.

Title
Global Fund-supported programmes' contribution to international targets and the Millennium Development Goals: an initial analysis.

OBJECTIVE
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is one of the largest funders to fight these diseases.
This paper discusses the programmatic contribution of Global Fund-supported programmes towards achieving international targets and Millennium Development Goals, using data from Global Fund grants.

METHODOLOGY
Results until June 2006 of 333 grants supported by the Global Fund in 127 countries were aggregated and compared against international targets for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Progress reports to the Global Fund secretariat were used as a basis to calculate results.
Service delivery indicators for antiretrovirals (ARV) for HIV/AIDS, case detection under the DOTS strategy for tuberculosis (DOTS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for malaria prevention were selected to estimate programmatic contributions to international targets for the three diseases.
Targets of Global Fund-supported programmes were projected based on proposals for Rounds 1 to 4 and compared to international targets for 2009.

FINDINGS
Results for Global Fund-supported programmes total 544 000 people on ARV, 1.4 million on DOTS and 11.3 million for ITNs by June 2006.
Global Fund-supported programmes contributed 18% of international ARV targets, 29% of DOTS targets and 9% of ITNs in sub-Saharan Africa by mid-2006.
Existing Global Fund-supported programmes have agreed targets that are projected to account for 19% of the international target for ARV delivery expected for 2009, 28% of the international target for DOTS and 84% of ITN targets in sub-Saharan Africa.

CONCLUSION
Global Fund-supported programmes have already contributed substantially to international targets by mid-2006, but there is a still significant gap.
Considerably greater financial support is needed, particularly for HIV, in order to achieve international targets for 2009.

Title
Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination in low-income countries: using cost-effectiveness affordability curves.

OBJECTIVE
We sought to describe a method that explicitly considers both a health-care programme's cost-effectiveness and its affordability.
For illustration, we apply the method to the programme to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B in the Gambia.

METHODS
We synthesized selected data and developed a computer-based model from the societal and payer perspectives to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine infant vaccination against hepatitis B in the Gambia compared with no vaccination.
The primary outcome measure was cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which was expressed in 2002 US dollars.
We used Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty analysis to examine the affordability of the programme from the payer's perspective, and we derived an affordability curve and cost-effectiveness affordability curves for the programme.

FINDINGS
In the Gambia, vaccinating infants against hepatitis B is highly cost-effective.
Compared with offering no intervention, the vaccination programme would cost US$ 28 per DALY averted from the societal perspective or US$ 47 per DALY averted from the payer's perspective.
The programme also has the potential to be affordable, starting at a relatively low budget of US$ 160 000 per year.
Combining the two dimensions of the outcome measure, the probability that vaccinating infants would be both cost-effective and affordable is 40% at an annual programme budget of US$ 182 000 (the estimated total programme cost from the payer's perspective), given a threshold cost-effectiveness value of US$ 47 per DALY averted.

CONCLUSION
In the face of uncertainties about both the health and economic consequences of a vaccine programme, as well as the availability and magnitude of resources needed to fund the programme, cost-effectiveness affordability curves can provide information to decision-makers about the probability that a programme will be both cost-effective and affordable: these are distinct but equally relevant considerations in resource-poor settings.

Title
The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies.

Abstract
Much biomedical research is observational.
The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability.
The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study.
We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies.
We convened a two-day workshop, in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers and journal editors to draft a checklist of items.
This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations.
The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles.
Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies.
A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine and Epidemiology.
We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.

Title
Offering integrated care for HIV/AIDS, diabetes and hypertension within chronic disease clinics in Cambodia.

PROBLEM
In Cambodia, care for people with HIV/AIDS (prevalence 1.9%) is expanding, but care for people with type II diabetes (prevalence 5-10%), arterial hypertension and other treatable chronic diseases remains very limited.

APPROACH
We describe the experience and outcomes of offering integrated care for HIV/AIDS, diabetes and hypertension within the setting of chronic disease clinics.

LOCAL SETTING
Chronic disease clinics were set up in the provincial referral hospitals of Siem Reap and Takeo, 2 provincial capitals in Cambodia.

RELEVANT CHANGES
At 24 months of care, 87.7% of all HIV/AIDS patients were alive and in active follow-up.
For diabetes patients, this proportion was 71%.
Of the HIV/AIDS patients, 9.3% had died and 3% were lost to follow-up, while for diabetes this included 3 (0.1%) deaths and 28.9% lost to follow-up.
Of all diabetes patients who stayed more than 3 months in the cohort, 90% were still in follow-up at 24 months.

LESSONS LEARNED
Over the first three years, the chronic disease clinics have demonstrated the feasibility of integrating care for HIV/AIDS with non-communicable chronic diseases in Cambodia.
Adherence support strategies proved to be complementary, resulting in good outcomes.
Services were well accepted by patients, and this has had a positive effect on HIV/AIDS-related stigma.
This experience shows how care for HIV/AIDS patients can act as an impetus to tackle other common chronic diseases.

Title
Progress and shortcomings in European national strategic plans for pandemic influenza.

OBJECTIVE
To repeat and update our previous evaluation (2005) of Europe's national pandemic influenza preparedness plans and assess the progress that has been made.

METHODS
We assessed published national pandemic influenza preparedness plans from the European Union countries, from the two acceding countries (Bulgaria and Romania) and from Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.
Plans were eligible for inclusion if formally published before 30 September 2006.
We referred to WHO guidelines and used a systematically applied data extraction form.
We considered plans in relation to border control measures, antiviral drugs and vaccines.

FINDINGS
Twenty-nine countries had plans that were included in the analysis, compared with 21 countries in 2005.
Substantial differences existed in countries' plans for border control measures, and many plans diverged from WHO guidelines.
Likewise, countries' plans on antiviral drugs and vaccines varied and operational planning remained weak.

CONCLUSION
Although progress has been made in the completeness of plans, problems remain unsolved regarding national plans' divergence from international recommendations, persisting strategic incoherence and operational limitations in relation to potentially scarce resources.
Border control plans also show gaps and inconsistencies, and these are likely to be politically volatile during a pandemic.

Title
Maximizing the contribution of the public health workforce: the English experience.

Abstract
In the United Kingdom, until the 1990s, specialist practice of public health was dominated by the medical profession.
During the past decade, the contributions to specialist public health practice of people from diverse disciplines have become recognized, respected and valued.
In parallel to this paradigm shift in culture in the specialist workforce, recognition is growing of the importance to health improvement of the routine activities of people in other jobs, whose daily work can have a significant impact on population health.
These people include public health practitioners, such as environmental health officials, but also others in a very wide range of occupations, from local government chief executive officers to catering assistants, who, although their actions can have a substantial influence on public health, would not traditionally have been viewed as part of the public health workforce.
Transforming opportunities for training and professional development to meet the diverse needs of these different groups within the public health workforce for them to recognize and fulfil their potential for health improvement is an important challenge, if we are to achieve continuing improvements in public health.
Presenting England's attempts to address the challenges of recruiting and training the range of people needed to deliver effective intersectoral public health may offer insights for those facing similar challenges in other countries.

Title
Training of public health workforce at the National School of Public Health: meeting Africa's needs.

PROBLEM
The inadequate number of trained public health personnel in Africa remains a challenge.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the estimated workforce of public health practitioners is 1.3% of the world's health workforce addressing 25% of the world's burden of disease.

APPROACH
To address this gap, the National School of Public Health at the then Medical University of Southern Africa created an innovative approach using distance learning components to deliver its public health programmes.
Compulsory classroom teaching is limited to four two-week blocks.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Combining mainly online components with traditional classroom curricula reduced limitations caused by geographical distances.
At the same time, the curriculum was structured to contextualize continental health issues in both course work and research specific to students' needs.

LESSONS LEARNED
The approach used by the National School of Public Health allows for a steady increase in the number of public health personnel in Africa.
Because of the flexible e-learning components and African-specific research projects, graduates from 16 African countries could avail of this programme.
An evaluation showed that such programmes need to constantly motivate participants to reduce student dropout rates and computer literacy needs to be a pre-requisite for entry into the programme.
Short certificate courses in relevant public health areas would be beneficial in the African context.
This programme could be replicated in other regions of the continent.

Title
Problems and progress in public health education.

Abstract
Further development of public health education is critical to improve population health globally.
A debate on the relevance and direction of some 400 schools of public health and many other related institutions around the world is therefore timely.
Some argue that most public health schools set up in low-income countries blindly follow their counterparts in high-income countries, reproducing classroom-based teaching, churning out epidemiologists with limited understanding of how to work within a health system to address local needs or how to align multiple partners towards population and equity health objectives.
Others argue that schools in high-income countries focus on the science, whereas those in low-income countries plagued with resource constraints focus exclusively on the art.
This round table discussion asks deans and directors of schools of public health from around the world to identify innovations in public health training, research and practice that will render schools relevant to health and development challenges.

Title
Prevalence of tuberculous infection and incidence of tuberculosis: a re-assessment of the Styblo rule.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the validity of the fixed mathematical relationship between the annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARTI), the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) and the incidence of smear-positive TB specified as the Styblo rule, which TB control programmes use to estimate the incidence of TB disease at a population level and the case detection rate.

METHODS
Population-based tuberculin surveys and surveys on prevalence of smear-positive TB since 1975 were identified through a literature search.
For these surveys, the ratio between the number of tuberculous infections (based on ARTI estimates) and the number of smear-positive TB cases was calculated and compared to the ratio of 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear- positive TB case as part of the Styblo rule.

FINDINGS
Three countries had national population-based data on both ARTI and prevalence of smear-positive TB for more than one point in time.
In China the ratio ranged from 3.4 to 5.8, in the Philippines from 2.6 to 4.4, and in the Republic of Korea, from 3.2 to 4.7.
All ratios were markedly lower than the ratio that is part of the Styblo rule.

CONCLUSION
According to recent country data, there are typically fewer than 8 to 12 tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case, and it remains unclear whether this ratio varies significantly among countries.
The decrease in the ratio compared to the Styblo rule probably relates to improvements in the prompt treatment of TB disease (by national TB programmes).
A change in the number of tuberculous infections per prevalent smear-positive TB case in population-based surveys makes the assumed fixed mathematical relationship between ARTI and incidence of smear-positive TB no longer valid.

Title
High-end physician migration from India.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the relation between the quality of physicians and migration among alumni of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India over the period 1989-2000.

METHODS
In a retrospective cohort study, data on graduates of AIIMS were collected from entrance exam qualifier lists, the AIIMS alumni directory, convocation records, the American Medical Association and informal alumni networks.
The data were analysed by use of 2x2 contingency tables and logistic regression models.

FINDINGS
Nearly 54% of AIIMS graduates during 1989-2000 now reside outside India.
Students admitted under the general category are twice as likely to reside abroad (95% confidence interval: 1.53-2.99) as students admitted under the affirmative-action category.
Recipients of multiple academic awards were 35% more likely to emigrate than non-recipients of awards (95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.76).
Multivariate analyses do not change these basic conclusions.

CONCLUSION
Graduates from higher quality institutions account for a disproportionately large share of emigrating physicians.
Even within high-end institutions, such as AIIMS, better physicians are more likely to emigrate.
Interventions should focus on the highly trained individuals in the top institutions that contribute disproportionately to the loss of human resources for health.
Our findings suggest that affirmative-action programmes may have an unintended benefit in that they may help retain a subset of such personnel.

Title
Beyond good intentions: lessons on equipment donation from an African hospital.

OBJECTIVE
In 2000, a referral hospital in the Gambia accepted a donation of oxygen concentrators to help maintain oxygen supplies.
The concentrators broke down and were put into storage.
A case study was done to find the reasons for the problem and to draw lessons to help improve both oxygen supplies and the success of future equipment donations.

METHODS
A technical assessment of the concentrators was carried out by a biomedical engineer with relevant expertise.
Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with key informants, and content analysis and inductive approaches were applied to construct the history of the episode and the reasons for the failure.

FINDINGS
Interviews confirmed the importance of technical problems with the equipment.
They also revealed that the donation process was flawed, and that the hospital did not have the expertise to assess or maintain the equipment.
Technical assessment showed that all units had the wrong voltage and frequency, leading to overheating and breakdown.
Subsequently a hospital donations committee was established to oversee the donations process.
On-site biomedical engineering expertise was arranged with a nongovernmental organization (NGO) partner.

CONCLUSION
Appropriate donations of medical equipment, including oxygen concentrators, can be of benefit to hospitals in resource-poor settings, but recipients and donors need to actively manage donations to ensure that the donations are beneficial.
Success requires planning, technical expertise and local participation.
Partners with relevant skills and resources may also be needed.
In 2002, WHO produced guidelines for medical equipment donations, which address problems that might be encountered.
These guidelines should be publicized and used.

Title
Global magnitude of visual impairment caused by uncorrected refractive errors in 2004.

Abstract
Estimates of the prevalence of visual impairment caused by uncorrected refractive errors in 2004 have been determined at regional and global levels for people aged 5 years and over from recent published and unpublished surveys.
The estimates were based on the prevalence of visual acuity of less than 6/18 in the better eye with the currently available refractive correction that could be improved to equal to or better than 6/18 by refraction or pinhole.
A total of 153 million people (range of uncertainty: 123 million to 184 million) are estimated to be visually impaired from uncorrected refractive errors, of whom eight million are blind.
This cause of visual impairment has been overlooked in previous estimates that were based on best-corrected vision.
Combined with the 161 million people visually impaired estimated in 2002 according to best-corrected vision, 314 million people are visually impaired from all causes: uncorrected refractive errors become the main cause of low vision and the second cause of blindness.
Uncorrected refractive errors can hamper performance at school, reduce employability and productivity, and generally impair quality of life.
Yet the correction of refractive errors with appropriate spectacles is among the most cost-effective interventions in eye health care.
The results presented in this paper help to unearth a formerly hidden problem of public health dimensions and promote policy development and implementation, programmatic decision-making and corrective interventions, as well as stimulate research.

Title
Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: a new delivery system and its effect on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes in Uganda.

OBJECTIVE
To assess whether traditional birth attendants, drug-shop vendors, community reproductive-health workers, or adolescent peer mobilizers could administer intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) for malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women.

METHODS
A non-randomized community trial was implemented in 21 community clusters (intervention) and four clusters where health units provided routine IPTp (control).
The primary outcome measures were access and adherence to IPTp, number of malaria episodes, prevalence of anaemia, and birth weight.
Numbers of live births, abortions, still births, and maternal and child deaths were secondary endpoints.

FINDINGS
1404 (67.5%) of 2081 with the new delivery system received two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine versus 281 (39.9%) of 704 with health units (P < 0.0001).
The prevalence of malaria episodes decreased from 906 (49.5%) of 1830 to 160 (17.6%) of 909 (P < 0.001) with the new delivery system and from 161 (39.1%) of 412 to 13 (13.1%) of 99 (P < 0.001) with health units.
Anaemia was significantly less prevalent in both arms.
There was a lower proportion of low birth weight 6.0% with the new delivery system versus 8.3% with health units (P < 0.03).
Few abortions and stillbirths were recorded in either arm.
Fewer children and women who accessed IPTp with health units died than in the intervention group.

CONCLUSION
The new approaches were associated with early access and increased adherence to IPTp.
Health units were, however, more effective in reducing parasitaemia and malaria episodes.
We recommend further studies to assess programming modalities linking the new approaches and health units.

Title
Individual and population burdens of major trauma in the Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the impact of major trauma on individual and population health.

METHODS
Data from a regional trauma registry were used, including all trauma fatalities and nonfatal severely injured patients (injury severity score >15) in 1999 and 2000.
The impact of fatalities was expressed in terms of years of life lost (YLL).
The impact of severe injury on survivors was expressed in terms of years lived with disability (YLD).
Disability weights were based on quality of life at 15 months after injury, measured with EuroQol-5D.
Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs.

FINDINGS
There were 567 fatalities and 335 survivors.
At the individual level, trauma fatalities (32 YLLs per patient) and nonfatal cases of major trauma (12 YLDs per patient) both led to a substantial loss of healthy life years.
Each victim of major trauma contributed an average of 25 DALYs to the burden of disease.
At the population level, major trauma caused 10 DALYs per 1000 inhabitants.
Road-traffic injury was the main contributor to the population burden of major trauma.

CONCLUSION
Both at individual and population levels, major trauma has a massive impact on health.
Most severely injured victims of road-traffic crashes reach the hospital and have good chances of survival.
Injury prevention and trauma care policies should aim at further reduction of both fatalities and permanent consequences among survivors.

Title
Methodological considerations in implementing the WHO Global Survey for Monitoring Maternal and Perinatal Health.

OBJECTIVE
To set up a global system for monitoring maternal and perinatal health in 54 countries worldwide.

METHODS
The WHO Global Survey for Monitoring Maternal and Perinatal Health was implemented through a network of health institutions, selected using a stratified multistage cluster sampling design.
Focused information on maternal and perinatal health was abstracted from hospital records and entered in a specially developed online data management system.
Data were collected over a two- to three-month period in each institution.
The project was coordinated by WHO and supported by WHO regional offices and country coordinators in Africa and the Americas.

FINDINGS
The initial survey was implemented between September 2004 and March 2005 in the African and American regions.
A total of 131 institutions in seven African countries and 119 institutions in eight Latin American countries participated.

CONCLUSION
This project has created a technologically simple and scientifically sound system for large-scale data management, which can facilitate programme monitoring in countries.

Title
Vaccination greatly reduces disease, disability, death and inequity worldwide.

Abstract
In low-income countries, infectious diseases still account for a large proportion of deaths, highlighting health inequities largely caused by economic differences.
Vaccination can cut health-care costs and reduce these inequities.
Disease control, elimination or eradication can save billions of US dollars for communities and countries.
Vaccines have lowered the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and will control cervical cancer.
Travellers can be protected against "exotic" diseases by appropriate vaccination.
Vaccines are considered indispensable against bioterrorism.
They can combat resistance to antibiotics in some pathogens.
Noncommunicable diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, could also be reduced by influenza vaccination.
Immunization programmes have improved the primary care infrastructure in developing countries, lowered mortality in childhood and empowered women to better plan their families, with consequent health, social and economic benefits.
Vaccination helps economic growth everywhere, because of lower morbidity and mortality.
The annual return on investment in vaccination has been calculated to be between 12% and 18%.
Vaccination leads to increased life expectancy.
Long healthy lives are now recognized as a prerequisite for wealth, and wealth promotes health.
Vaccines are thus efficient tools to reduce disparities in wealth and inequities in health.

Title
Optimizing paediatric HIV care in Kenya: challenges in early infant diagnosis.

PROBLEM
In 2003, the goal of the Kenyan Ministry of Health was to avail antiretroviral treatment (ART) to 50% of the estimated 250 000 eligible individuals by the end of 2005.
By July 2005, 45 000 adults and more than 2000 children were on treatment.
A study was conducted to determine the barriers to identification of HIV-infected children.

APPROACH
Existing government policies were reviewed and the ART register of the Kenya National AIDS Control Programme was used to identify facilities providing ART.
This paper reports the findings around diagnosis and staging of HIV infection in children.

LOCAL SETTING
At the time of the study, 58 health facilities were providing ART to children.
Only one institution had achieved universal HIV testing in the antenatal clinics.
Six facilities systematically followed up HIV-exposed children.
HIV antibody testing was not readily available to the children.
Although four research centres were capable of carrying out diagnostic HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the services were restricted to research purposes.
Other constraints were inadequate physical infrastructure, inadequate systems for quality control in the laboratories and shortage of staff.

LESSONS LEARNT
The policy framework to support identification of HIV-infected children had been established, albeit with narrow focus on sick children.
The assessment identified the weaknesses in the structures for systematic diagnosis of HIV through laboratory or clinical-based algorithms.
The researchers concluded that health staff training and implementation of a systematic standard approach to identification of HIV-infected children is urgently required.

Title
A cohort study to assess the new WHO Japanese encephalitis surveillance standards.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the field-test version of the new WHO Japanese encephalitis (JE) surveillance standards.

METHODS
We applied the clinical case definition of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), laboratory diagnostic criteria and case classifications to patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) infections in southern Viet Nam.

FINDINGS
Of the 380 patients (149 children) recruited with suspected CNS infections, 296 (96 children) met the AES case definition.
54 children were infected with JE virus (JEV), of whom 35 (65%) had AES, giving a sensitivity of 65% (95% CI: 56-73) and specificity of 39% (95% CI: 30-48).
Nine adults with JEV presented with AES.
19 JEV-infected children missed by surveillance included 10 with acute flaccid paralysis, two with flaccid hemiparesis and six with meningism only.
Altering the case definition to include limb paralysis and meningism improved sensitivity to 89% (95% CI: 83-95), while reducing specificity to 23% (95% CI: 15-30).
Six children that did not have AES on admission had reduced consciousness after admission.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis diagnosed seven patients negative on serum analysis.
Five patients with neurological manifestations of dengue infection had JEV antibodies in serum and would have been misdiagnosed had we not tested for dengue antibodies in parallel.

CONCLUSION
Children infected with JEV that presented with acute limb paralysis or neck stiffness only were missed by the surveillance standards, although some of them subsequently became encephalopathic.
A footnote in the surveillance standards drawing attention to these presentations would be helpful.
An acute CSF sample is more sensitive and specific than an acute serum sample.

Title
Towards elimination: measles susceptibility in Australia and 17 European countries.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate age-specific measles susceptibility in Australia and 17 European countries.

METHODS
As part of the European Sero-Epidemiology Network 2 (ESEN2), 18 countries collected large national serum banks between 1996 and 2004.
These banks were tested for measles IgG and the results converted to a common unitage to enable valid intercountry comparisons.
Historical vaccination and disease incidence data were also collected.
Age-stratified population susceptibility levels were compared to WHO European Region targets for measles elimination of < 15% in those aged 2-4 years, < 10% in 5-9-year-olds and < 5% in older age groups.

FINDINGS
Seven countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden) met or came very close to the elimination targets.
Four countries (Australia, Israel, Lithuania and Malta) had susceptibility levels above WHO targets in some older age groups indicating possible gaps in protection.
Seven countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, England and Wales, Ireland, Latvia and Romania) were deemed to be at risk of epidemics as a result of high susceptibility in children and also, in some cases, adults.

CONCLUSION
Although all countries now implement a two-dose measles vaccination schedule, if the WHO European Region target of measles elimination by 2010 is to be achieved higher routine coverage as well as vaccination campaigns in some older age cohorts are needed in some countries.
Without these improvements, continued measles transmission and outbreaks are expected in Europe.

Title
HIV, infant feeding and more perils for poor people: new WHO guidelines encourage review of formula milk policies.

Abstract
The release of the new WHO guidelines on HIV and infant feeding, in a global context of widespread impoverishment, requires countries to re-examine their infant-feeding policies in relation to broader socioeconomic issues.
This widening scope is necessitated by compelling new reports on the scale of global underdevelopment in developing countries.
This paper explores these issues by addressing feeding choices made by HIV-infected mothers and programmes supplying free formula milks within a global environment of persistent poverty.
Accumulating evidence on the increase in malnutrition, morbidity and mortality associated with the avoidance or early cessation of breastfeeding by HIV-infected mothers, and the unanticipated hazards of formula feeding, demand a deeper assessment of the measures necessary for optimum policies on infant and child nutrition and for the amelioration of poverty.
Piecemeal interventions that increase resources directed at only a fraction of a family's impoverishment, such as basic materials for preparation of hygienic formula feeds and making flawed decisions on choice of infant feeding, are bound to fail.
These are not alternatives to taking fundamental steps to alleviate poverty.
The economic opportunity costs of such programmes, the equity costs of providing resources to some and not others, and the leakages due to temptation to sell capital goods require careful evaluation.
Providing formula to poor populations with high HIV prevalence cannot be justified by the evidence, by humanitarian considerations, by respect for local traditions or by economic outcomes.
Exclusive breastfeeding, which is threatened by the HIV epidemic, remains an unfailing anchor of child survival.

Title
Cost and effectiveness analysis of immunization service delivery support in Andhra Pradesh, India.

Abstract
The immunization service delivery support (ISDS) model was initiated in Andhra Pradesh, India, in November 2003 with the aim of strengthening immunization services through supportive supervision.
The ISDS model involves a well-established supervision system built upon the existing health infrastructure.
The objectives of this approach are to: (1) identify areas of high performance and those that need improvement, (2) assist staff in identifying and correcting wrong practices, (3) improve staff skills, (4) motivate staff, and (5) initiate corrective actions at appropriate levels through information sharing.
An evaluation of cost and effectiveness of ISDS in 16 districts that participated in the programme found that the incremental cost associated with three rounds of supportive supervision visits was approximately US$ 110 630 (US$ 36 877 per round).
The performance of health centre and immunization sessions was evaluated using 43- and 28-point checklists, respectively, and demonstrated significant improvement during and following the two-year implementation of ISDS.
The average percentage change in health centre performance scores from baseline to the fourth round of evaluation was approximately 36%, and immunization session performance scores increased by an average of 9%.
The incremental costs per additional per cent increase in average health centre performance score and per additional per cent increase in average immunization session performance score over the evaluation period were estimated to be US$ 3091 and US$ 12 760, respectively.
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are relatively sensitive to personnel and travel costs.
Integration of ISDS into the Andhra Pradesh immunization system is projected to result in a 39% potential cost savings per round of supervision visit.

Title
Prevalence of female genital cutting among Egyptian girls.

OBJECTIVE
Female genital cutting (FGC) is the collective name given to traditional practices that involve partial or total cutting away of the female external genitalia whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons.
In Egypt, the result of the Demographic Health Survey in 2000 revealed that 97% of married women included in the survey experienced FGC.
The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of FGC among schoolgirls in Egypt.

METHODS
Multistage random technique was applied for site selection.
First, Egypt was divided into five geographical areas; Greater Cairo, Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, Sinai and Suez Canal Region.
Second, from each governorate, two educational districts were selected randomly (except Luxor).
In each of the selected districts, the schools were divided into primary, preparatory and secondary schools.
In each education stage, the schools were divided into rural, urban, government and private.
The total number of females interviewed was 38 816.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of FGC among schoolgirls in Egypt was 50.3%.
The prevalence of FGC was 46.2% in government urban schools, 9.2% in private urban schools and 61.7% in rural schools.
Educational levels of mother and father were negatively associated with FGC (P < 0.001).
The mean age of the time of FGC was 10.1 ± 2.3 years.

CONCLUSION
FGC prevalence is lowering, yet more active education at the grass-roots level is needed to create change.

Title
Socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition in developing countries.

OBJECTIVE
The objectives of this study were to report on socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition in the developing world, to provide evidence for an association between socioeconomic inequality and the average level of malnutrition, and to draw attention to different patterns of socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition.

METHODS
Both stunting and wasting were measured using new WHO child growth standards.
Socioeconomic status was estimated by principal component analysis using a set of household assets and living conditions.
Socioeconomic inequality was measured using an alternative concentration index that avoids problems with dependence on the mean level of malnutrition.

FINDINGS
In almost all countries investigated, stunting and wasting disproportionately affected the poor.
However, socioeconomic inequality in wasting was limited and was not significant in about one third of countries.
After correcting for the concentration index's dependence on mean malnutrition, there was no clear association between average stunting and socioeconomic inequality.
The latter showed different patterns, which were termed mass deprivation, queuing and exclusion.
Although average levels of malnutrition were higher with the new WHO reference standards, estimates of socioeconomic inequality were largely unaffected by changing the growth standards.

CONCLUSION
Socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition existed throughout the developing world, and was not related to the average malnutrition rate.
Failure to tackle this inequality is a cause of social injustice.
Moreover, reducing the overall rate of malnutrition does not necessarily lead to a reduction in inequality.
Policies should, therefore, take into account the distribution of childhood malnutrition across all socioeconomic groups.

Title
From research to national expansion: 20 years' experience of community-based management of childhood pneumonia in Nepal.

PROBLEM
Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality of children aged under five in Nepal.
Research conducted by John Snow Inc. in the 1980s determined that pneumonia case management by community-based workers decreased under-five mortality by 28%.

APPROACH
Female community health volunteers were selected as the national cadre to manage childhood pneumonia at community level using oral antibiotics.
A technical working group composed of government officials, local experts and donor partners embarked on a process to develop a strategy to pilot the approach and expand it nationally.

LOCAL SETTING
High under-five mortality rates, low access to peripheral health facilities and severe constraints in human resources led Nepal's Ministry of Health to test this innovative approach.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Community-based management of pneumonia doubled the total number of cases treated compared with districts with facility-based treatment only.
Over half of the cases were treated by the female community health volunteers.
The programme was phased in over 14 years and now 69% of Nepal's under-five population has access to pneumonia treatment.

LESSONS LEARNED
Community-based management of pneumonia provides a medium-term solution to address a leading cause of child mortality while the efforts continue to strengthen and extend the reach of facility-based care.
Trained community health workers can significantly increase the number of pneumonia cases receiving correct case management in resource-constrained settings, with appropriate health systems' support for logistics, supervision and monitoring.
Community-based management of pneumonia can be scaled up and provides an effective approach to reducing child deaths in countries faced with insufficient human resources for health.

Title
Challenges to improving case management of childhood pneumonia at health facilities in resource-limited settings.

Abstract
Effective case management is an important strategy to reduce pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality in children.
Guidelines based on sound evidence are available but are used variably.
This review outlines current guidelines for childhood pneumonia management in the setting where most child pneumonia deaths occur and identifies challenges for improved management in a variety of settings and different "at-risk" groups.
These include appropriate choice of antibiotic, clinical overlap with other conditions, prompt and appropriate referral for inpatient care, and management of treatment failure.
Management of neonates, and of HIV-infected or severely malnourished children is more complicated.
The influence of co-morbidities on pneumonia outcome means that pneumonia case management must be integrated within strategies to improve overall paediatric care.
The greatest potential for reducing pneumonia-related deaths in health facilities is wider implementation of the current guidelines built around a few core activities: training, antibiotics and oxygen.
This requires investment in human resources and in equipment for the optimal management of hypoxaemia.
It is important to provide data from a variety of epidemiological settings for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.
Improvements in the quality of case management of pneumonia can be a vehicle for overall improvements in child health-care practices.

Title
Vaccines to prevent pneumonia and improve child survival.

Abstract
For more than 30 years, vaccines have played an important part in pneumonia prevention.
Recent advances have created opportunities for further improving child survival through prevention of childhood pneumonia by vaccination.
Maximizing routine immunization with pertussis and measles vaccines, coupled with provision of a second opportunity for measles immunization, has rapidly reduced childhood deaths in low-income countries especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
Vaccines against the two leading bacterial causes of child pneumonia deaths, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), can further improve child survival by preventing about 1 075 000 child deaths per year.
Both Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven safety and effectiveness for prevention of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, including in low-income and industrializing countries.
Both are recommended by WHO for inclusion in national programmes, and, at sharply tiered prices, these vaccines generally meet international criteria of cost-effectiveness for low-income countries.
Vaccines only target selected pneumonia pathogens and are less than 100% effective, so they must be complemented by curative care and other preventative strategies.
As part of a comprehensive child survival package, the particular advantages of vaccines include the ability to reach a high proportion of all children, including those who are difficult to reach with curative health services, and the ability to rapidly scale up coverage with new vaccines.
In this review, we discuss advances made in optimizing the use of established vaccines and the potential issues related to newer bacterial conjugate vaccines in reducing childhood pneumonia morbidity and mortality.

Title
Community case management of pneumonia: at a tipping point?.

Abstract
Pneumonia is the leading cause of child mortality globally.
Community case management (CCM) of pneumonia by community health workers is a feasible, effective strategy to complement facility-based management for areas that lack access to facilities.
We surveyed experts in the 57 African and Asian countries with the highest levels and rates of childhood mortality to assess current policies, implementation and plans regarding CCM of pneumonia.
About one-third (20/54) of countries reported policies supporting CCM for pneumonia, and another third (18/54) reported no policy against the strategy.
Half (27/54) the countries reported some implementation of CCM for pneumonia, but often on a small scale.
A few countries sustain a large-scale programme.
Programmes, community health workers and policy parameters varied greatly among implementing countries.
About half (12/26)of non-implementing countries are planning to move ahead with the strategy.
Momentum is gathering for CCM for pneumonia as a strategy to address the pneumonia treatment gap and help achieve Millennium Development Goal 4.
Challenges remain to: (1) introduce this strategy into policy and implement it in high pneumonia burden countries; (2) increase coverage of this strategy in countries currently implementing it; and (3) better define and monitor implementation at the country level.

Title
Equity and child-survival strategies.

Abstract
Recent advances in child survival have often been at the expense of increasing inequity.
Successive interventions are applied to the same population sectors, while the same children in other sectors consistently miss out, leading to a trend towards increasing inequity in child survival.
This is particularly important in the case of pneumonia, the leading cause of child death, which is closely linked to poverty and malnutrition, and for which effective community-based case management is more difficult to achieve than for other causes of child death.
The key strategies for the prevention of childhood pneumonia are case management, mainly through Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), and immunization, particularly the newer vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus.
There is a tendency to introduce both interventions into communities that already have access to basic health care and preventive services, thereby increasing the relative disadvantage experienced by those children without such access.
Both strategies can be implemented in such a way as to decrease rather than increase inequity.
It is important to monitor equity when introducing child-survival interventions.
Economic poverty, as measured by analyses based on wealth quintiles, is an important determinant of inequity in health outcomes but in some settings other factors may be of greater importance.
Geography and ethnicity can both lead to failed access to health care, and therefore inequity in child survival.
Poorly functioning health facilities are also of major importance.
Countries need to be aware of the main determinants of inequity in their communities so that measures can be taken to ensure that IMCI, new vaccine implementation and other child-survival strategies are introduced in an equitable manner.

Title
Cost of providing the expanded programme on immunization: findings from a facility-based study in Viet Nam, 2005.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate and analyse the costs for providing the expanded programme on immunization (EPI) in a rural community in the north of Viet Nam in 2005.

METHODS
An ingredient approach was used to collect cost data from the perspective of the service providers.

FINDINGS
The total annual cost of EPI in Bavi district was US$ 58 460 [purchasing power parity (PPP) 282 076].
Vaccines and supplies were the largest cost category (33%), followed by personnel costs (30.2%).
The largest share of the total cost was due to activities at commune level (38%).
The average cost per fully vaccinated child (FVC) was US$ 4.81 (PPP 23.21), much lower than the figure of US$ 15 that is generally accepted as the cost-effective threshold for EPI in developing countries.

CONCLUSION
This empirical study indicates that EPI has been implemented efficiently in rural Viet Nam, but that opportunities exist to make it even more efficient.

Title
Long-term trends in fetal mortality: implications for developing countries.

Abstract
This paper discusses the problems of defining and measuring late-fetal mortality (stillbirths).
It uses evidence from 11 developed countries to trace long-term trends in fetal mortality.
Issues associated with varying definitions and registration practices are identified, as well as the range of possible rates, key turning points and recent convergence.
The implications for developing countries are spelt out.
They emphasize the possible limitations of WHO estimation methods and survey-based data by examining the cross-sectional associations among 187 countries in the year 2000.
The important role of skilled birth attendants is emphasized in both data sets, but the different effects on maternal mortality and late-fetal mortality are also noted.

Title
Cervical cancer prevention and the Millennium Development Goals.

Abstract
The advent of new technologies such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and HPV DNA tests - along with new insights into the appropriate use of low-resource technologies such as visual inspection of the cervix and treatment of cervical lesions with cryotherapy - have increased optimism about the potential for effective disease control in low-resource settings.
Nevertheless, it is also important to ask ourselves how new health initiatives contribute, or fail to contribute, to major global undertakings such as achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
While reproductive health in general, and cervical cancer prevention in particular, are not explicitly mentioned among the MDGs, they are implied; and it is certain that women cannot contribute to sustainable development without good health.
The question is, in what ways do scaled-up cervical cancer prevention activities, including introduction of the new HPV vaccines and increased access to precancer screening and treatment, contribute to attainment of the MDGs?

Title
Forecasting the global shortage of physicians: an economic- and needs-based approach.

OBJECTIVE
Global achievements in health may be limited by critical shortages of health-care workers.
To help guide workforce policy, we estimate the future demand for, need for and supply of physicians, by WHO region, to determine where likely shortages will occur by 2015, the target date of the Millennium Development Goals.

METHODS
Using World Bank and WHO data on physicians per capita from 1980 to 2001 for 158 countries, we employ two modelling approaches for estimating the future global requirement for physicians.
A needs-based model determines the number of physicians per capita required to achieve 80% coverage of live births by a skilled health-care attendant.
In contrast, our economic model identifies the number of physicians per capita that are likely to be demanded, given each country's economic growth.
These estimates are compared to the future supply of physicians projected by extrapolating the historical rate of increase in physicians per capita for each country.

FINDINGS
By 2015, the global supply of physicians appears to be in balance with projected economic demand.
Because our measure of need reflects the minimum level of workforce density required to provide a basic health service that is met in all but the least developed countries, the needs-based estimates predict a global surplus of physicians.
However, on a regional basis, both models predict shortages for many countries in the WHO African Region in 2015, with some countries experiencing a needs-based shortage, a demand-based shortage, or both.

CONCLUSION
The type of policy intervention needed to alleviate projected shortages, such as increasing health-care training or adopting measures to discourage migration, depends on the type of shortage projected.

Title
Estimating the cardiovascular mortality burden attributable to the European Common Agricultural Policy on dietary saturated fats.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the burden of cardiovascular disease within 15 European Union countries (before the 2004 enlargement) as a result of excess dietary saturated fats attributable to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

METHODS
A spreadsheet model was developed to synthesize data on population, diet, cholesterol levels and mortality rates.
A conservative estimate of a reduction in saturated fat consumption of just 2.2 g was chosen, representing 1% of daily energy intake.
The fall in serum cholesterol concentration was then calculated, assuming that this 1% reduction in saturated fat consumption was replaced with 0.5% monounsaturated and 0.5% polyunsaturated fats.
The resulting reduction in cardiovascular and stroke deaths was then estimated, and a sensitivity analysis conducted.

FINDINGS
Reducing saturated fat consumption by 1% and increasing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat by 0.5% each would lower blood cholesterol levels by approximately 0.06 mmol/l, resulting in approximately 9800 fewer coronary heart disease deaths and 3000 fewer stroke deaths each year.

CONCLUSION
The cardiovascular disease burden attributable to CAP appears substantial.
Furthermore, these calculations were conservative estimates, and the true mortality burden may be higher.
The analysis contributes to the current wider debate concerning the relationship between CAP, health and chronic disease across Europe, together with recent international developments and commitments to reduce chronic diseases.
The reported mortality estimates should be considered in relation to the current CAP and any future reforms.

Title
Intimate femicide-suicide in South Africa: a cross-sectional study.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the incidence and patterns of intimate femicide-suicide in South Africa and to describe the factors associated with an increase in the risk of suicide after intimate femicide (i.e. the killing of an intimate female partner).

METHODS
A cross-sectional retrospective national mortuary-based study was conducted at a proportionate random sample of 25 legal laboratories to identify all homicides committed in 1999 of women aged over 13 years.
Data were collected from the mortuary file, autopsy report and a police interview.

FINDINGS
Among 1349 perpetrators of intimate femicide,19.4% committed suicide within a week of the murder.
Suicide after intimate femicide was more likely if the perpetrator was from a white rather than an African racial background (odds ratio, OR: 5.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.21-27.84); was employed as a professional or white-collar worker rather than a blue-collar worker (OR: 37.28; 95% CI: 5.82-238.93); and owned a legal gun rather than not owning a legal gun (OR: 45.26; 95% CI: 8.33-245.8).
The attributable fraction shows that 91.5% of the deaths of legal gun-owning perpetrators and their victims may have been averted if this group of perpetrators did not own a legal gun.

CONCLUSION
South Africa has a rate of intimate femicide-suicide that exceeds reported rates for other countries.
This study highlights the public health impact of legal gun ownership in cases of intimate femicide-suicide.

Title
Financial resources required for tuberculosis control to achieve global targets set for 2015.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the financial resources required to achieve the 2015 targets for global tuberculosis (TB) control, which have been set within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

METHODS
The Global Plan to Stop TB, 2006-2015 was developed by the Stop TB Partnership.
It sets out what needs to be done to achieve the 2015 targets for global TB control, based on WHO's Stop TB Strategy.
Plan costs were estimated using spreadsheet models that included epidemiological, demographic, planning and unit cost data.

FINDINGS
A total of US$ 56 billion is required during the period 2006-2015 (93% for TB-endemic countries, 7% for international technical agencies), increasing from US$ 3.5 billion in 2006 to US$ 6.7 billion in 2015.
The single biggest cost (US$ 3 billion per year) is for the treatment of drug-susceptible cases in DOTS programmes.
Other major costs are treatment of patients with multi- and extensively drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB and XDR-TB), collaborative TB/HIV activities, and advocacy, communication and social mobilization.
Low-income countries account for 41% of total funding needs and 65% of funding needs for TB/HIV.
Middle-income countries account for 72% of the funding needed for treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.
African countries require the largest increases in funding.

CONCLUSION
Achieving the 2015 global targets set for TB control requires a major increase in funding.
To support resource mobilization, comprehensive and costed national plans that are in line with the Global Plan to Stop TB are needed, backed up by robust assessments of the funding that can be raised in each country from domestic sources and the balance that is needed from donors.

Title
Herbal medicine research and global health: an ethical analysis.

Abstract
Governments, international agencies and corporations are increasingly investing in traditional herbal medicine research.
Yet little literature addresses ethical challenges in this research.
In this paper, we apply concepts in a comprehensive ethical framework for clinical research to international traditional herbal medicine research.
We examine in detail three key, underappreciated dimensions of the ethical framework in which particularly difficult questions arise for international herbal medicine research: social value, scientific validity and favourable risk-benefit ratio.
Significant challenges exist in determining shared concepts of social value, scientific validity and favourable risk-benefit ratio across international research collaborations.
However, we argue that collaborative partnership, including democratic deliberation, offers the context and process by which many of the ethical challenges in international herbal medicine research can, and should be, resolved.
By "cross-training" investigators, and investing in safety-monitoring infrastructure, the issues identified by this comprehensive framework can promote ethically sound international herbal medicine research that contributes to global health.

Title
Ethical analysis to improve decision-making on health technologies.

Abstract
Health technology assessment (HTA) is the multidisciplinary study of the implications of the development, diffusion and use of health technologies.
It supports health-policy decisions by providing a joint knowledge base for decision-makers.
To increase its policy relevance, HTA tries to extend beyond effectiveness and costs to also considering the social, organizational and ethical implications of technologies.
However, a commonly accepted method for analysing the ethical aspects of health technologies is lacking.
This paper describes a model for ethical analysis of health technology that is easy and flexible to use in different organizational settings and cultures.
The model is part of the EUnetHTA project, which focuses on the transferability of HTAs between countries.
The EUnetHTA ethics model is based on the insight that the whole HTA process is value laden.
It is not sufficient to only analyse the ethical consequences of a technology, but also the ethical issues of the whole HTA process must be considered.
Selection of assessment topics, methods and outcomes is essentially a value-laden decision.
Health technologies may challenge moral or cultural values and beliefs, and their implementation may also have significant impact on people other than the patient.
These are essential considerations for health policy.
The ethics model is structured around key ethical questions rather than philosophical theories, to be applicable to different cultures and usable by non-philosophers.
Integrating ethical considerations into HTA can improve the relevance of technology assessments for health care and health policy in both developed and developing countries.

Title
National bioethical legislation and guidelines for biomedical research in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Abstract
Rapid advances in biomedical science and technology, which have revolutionized medicine and health-care services in different societies, have been associated with inevitable ethical challenges.
Undoubtedly, these innovations could lead to irreversible disasters if they are not limited by appropriate regulations.
Substantial attempts have been made in the Islamic Republic of Iran to establish a structured approach for identifying, analysing and resolving ethical issues in clinical practice.
Given the consensus of religious and scientific scholars, some laws recently approved by the parliament include the Deceased and Brain-Dead Patients Organ Transplantation Act (2000), Embryo Donation to Infertile Spouses Act (2003) and the Therapeutic Abortion Act (2005).
National guidelines for ethical assessment and supervision of research proposals have also been compiled by the authorities.
This paper reviews the main endeavours made in bioethics legislation in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Title
Male circumcision for HIV prevention: a prospective study of complications in clinical and traditional settings in Bungoma, Kenya.

OBJECTIVE
Male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by approximately 60%.
Male circumcision services are now being introduced in selected populations in sub-Saharan Africa and further interventions are being planned.
A serious concern is whether male circumcision can be provided safely to large numbers of adult males in developing countries.

METHODS
This prospective study was conducted in the Bungoma district, Kenya, where male circumcision is universally practised.
Young males intending to undergo traditional or clinical circumcision were identified by a two-stage cluster sampling method.
During the July-August 2004 circumcision season, 1007 males were interviewed 30-89 days post- circumcision.
Twenty-four men were directly observed during and 3, 8, 30 and 90 days post-circumcision, and 298 men underwent clinical exams 45-89 days post-procedure.
Twenty-one traditional and 20 clinical practitioners were interviewed to assess their experience and training.
Inventories of health facilities were taken to assess the condition of instruments and supplies necessary for performing safe circumcisions.

FINDINGS
Of 443 males circumcised traditionally, 156 (35.2%) experienced an adverse event compared with 99 of 559 (17.7%) circumcised clinically (odds ratio: 2.53; 95% confidence interval: 1.89-3.38).
Bleeding and infection were the most common adverse effects, with excessive pain, lacerations, torsion and erectile dysfunction also observed.
Participants were aged 5 to 21 years and half were sexually active before circumcision.
Practitioners lacked knowledge and training.
Proper instruments and supplies were lacking at most health facilities.

CONCLUSION
Extensive training and resources will be necessary in sub-Saharan Africa before male circumcision can be aggressively promoted for HIV prevention.
Two-thirds of African men are circumcised, most by traditional or unqualified practitioners in informal settings.
Safety of circumcision in communities where it is already widely practised must not be ignored.

Title
Impact of misclassification on measures of cardiovascular disease mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a cross-sectional study.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the extent and pattern of misclassification of death from non-specific diagnoses emanating from the Iranian death registration system, and to correct the data for health policy and planning.

METHODS
Detailed medical records for 1426 hospital deaths classified to seven ill-defined or vague causes of death were reviewed by trained physicians, who then completed standard death certificates.
Underlying causes of death from the review were compared with the cause assigned in registration data.

FINDINGS
The probable underlying pattern of causes of death in the Islamic Republic of Iran is substantially different to that suggested by the death registration system.
About 88% of 582 cases with non-specific diagnoses at ages 15-69 years were reassigned to various specific causes including ischaemic heart disease (33%), stroke (13%) and injuries (10%).
A similar pattern of misclassification is apparent for 738 deaths at older ages (70 years and over), with 46% being reassigned to ischaemic heart disease and stroke.

CONCLUSION
A significant proportion of deaths in the Iranian death registration system are being classified to cause groups of little relevance to epidemiological research or health policy.
Reassignment of these deaths would increase the proportion of deaths from ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases each by 32%, diabetes mellitus by 68% and chronic lower respiratory diseases by 73%.
Substantial changes to procedures for diagnosing causes of death are urgently required if registration data are to effectively guide health policies and programmes in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Title
Use of Google EarthTM to strengthen public health capacity and facilitate management of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.

OBJECTIVE
Novel, inexpensive solutions are needed for improved management of vector-borne and other diseases in resource-poor environments.
Emerging free software providing access to satellite imagery and simple editing tools (e.g. Google EarthTM) complement existing geographic information system (GIS) software and provide new opportunities for: (i) strengthening overall public health capacity through development of information for city infrastructures; and (ii) display of public health data directly on an image of the physical environment.

METHODS
We used freely accessible satellite imagery and a set of feature-making tools included in the software (allowing for production of polygons, lines and points) to generate information for city infrastructure and to display disease data in a dengue decision support system (DDSS) framework.

FINDINGS
Two cities in Mexico (Chetumal and Merida) were used to demonstrate that a basic representation of city infrastructure useful as a spatial backbone in a DDSS can be rapidly developed at minimal cost.
Data layers generated included labelled polygons representing city blocks, lines representing streets, and points showing the locations of schools and health clinics.
City blocks were colour-coded to show presence of dengue cases.
The data layers were successfully imported in a format known as shapefile into a GIS software.

CONCLUSION
The combination of Google EarthTM and free GIS software (e.g. HealthMapper, developed by WHO, and SIGEpi, developed by PAHO) has tremendous potential to strengthen overall public health capacity and facilitate decision support system approaches to prevention and control of vector-borne diseases in resource-poor environments.

Title
Treatment of mental disorders for adolescents in Mexico City.

OBJECTIVE
This study describes the prevalence, adequacy and correlates of 12-month mental health service use among participants in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey.

METHODS
The authors conducted face-to-face household surveys of a probability sample of 3005 adolescents aged 12-17 years residing in the Mexico City metropolitan area during 2005.
The prevalence of mental health disorders and the use of services were assessed with the computer-assisted adolescent version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Correlates of service use and adequate treatment were identified in logistic regression analyses that took into account the complex sample design and weighting process.

FINDINGS
Less than one in seven respondents with psychiatric disorders used any mental health services during the previous year.
Respondents with substance-use disorders reported the highest prevalence of service use and those with anxiety disorders the lowest.
Approximately one in every two respondents receiving any services obtained treatment that could be considered minimally adequate.

CONCLUSION
We found large unmet needs for mental health services among adolescents with psychiatric disorders in Mexico City.
Improvements in the mental health care of Mexican youth are urgently needed.

Title
Political and social context of not attaining the Millennium Development Goal to reduce poverty.

OBJECTIVE
Eradication of poverty is Target 1 of the first of eight Millennium Development Goals, which were adopted by world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in the year 2000.
This study aims to explore the influence of political and social context in the achievement of poverty eradication.

METHODS
A retrospective ecological study was carried out to explore associations between progress towards the achievement of Target 1 in 2002 and political and social context variables.
The study contained cross-sectional estimates in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2002.
The analysis and observation unit was the countries (n = 88).
A descriptive analysis was made, as well as simple and multiple analyses with logistic regression.

FINDINGS
Of the 88 countries studied, 71 (80.7%) are not on track to achieving the target of eradicating poverty.
The factor most associated with non-attainment of this goal was reduced government consumption per capita (odds ratio, OR: 13.8; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.92-65.26).
In the multiple regression analysis, the most significant factors are: reduced government consumption per capita (OR: 9.8; 95% CI: 1.82-52.75), losses in the balance between imports and exports (OR: 5.3; 95% CI: 1.32-21.54) and more inequality in family income (OR: 4.7; 95% CI: 1.12-20.01).

CONCLUSION
Progress towards achievement of Target 1 seems to be hindered, fundamentally, by the significant reduction in government consumption in certain countries and the absence of redistribution policies.
To understand the political determinants of poverty, more attention must be paid to the national and international political milieu, which seem to have a relevant impact on this problem and hence on population health.

Title
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of safety and efficacy of combined praziquantel and artemether treatment for acute schistosomiasis japonica in China.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining artemether (AM) and praziquantel (PZQ) in different regimens for treating acute schistosomiasis japonica.

METHODS
We undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial within four specialized schistosomiasis hospitals in the Dongting Lake region, Hunan province, China, between May 2003 and December 2005.
Study participants were randomized into one of four treatment regimes: group A received 60 mg/kg PZQ + 6 mg/kg AM; group B received 60 mg/kg PZQ + AM placebo; group C received 120 mg/kg PZQ + 6 mg/kg AM; and group D received 120 mg/kg PZQ + AM placebo.
All participants were followed up over a 45-day period.
The primary endpoint of the trial was human infection status (determined by positive stool examination).
Secondary endpoints involved clinical observations and blood biochemistry, including monitoring haemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels over time.

FINDINGS
Treatment efficacies of the four different treatment regimens were 98.0%, 96.4%, 97.7% and 95.7% for group A, B, C, and D respectively (P > 0.05).
The group B had a greater treatment efficacy (96.4%) than the group D (95.7%) (P > 0.05).
Group A treatment was better for clearance of fever (P < 0.05) and resulted in a shorter hospitalization time (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSION
This is the first report of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for evaluating combined chemotherapy with AM and two different dosages (60 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg) of PZQ in the treatment of acute schistosomiasis japonica in China.
The combination of AM and PZQ chemotherapy did not improve treatment efficacy compared with PZQ alone.
PZQ given as a dosage of 60 mg/kg (1 day, 3 × 20 mg/kg doses at 4-5 hour intervals) may be as effective as a dosage of 120 mg/kg (6 days, 20 mg/kg for each day split into 3 doses at 4-5 hour intervals).

Title
An estimate of the global prevalence and incidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 infection.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the global prevalence and incidence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in 2003.

METHODS
A systematic review was undertaken of published seroprevalence surveys describing the prevalence or incidence of HSV-2 by age and gender.
For each of 12 regions, pooled prevalence values by age and gender were generated in a random-effect model.
HSV-2 incidence was then estimated from these pooled values using a constant-incidence model.
Values of the HSV-2 seroprevalence from the model fits were applied to the total population to estimate the numbers of people infected.

FINDINGS
The total number of people aged 15-49 years who were living with HSV-2 infection worldwide in 2003 is estimated to be 536 million, while the total number of people who were newly infected with HSV-2 in 2003 is estimated to be 23.6 million.
While the estimates are limited by poor availability of data, general trends are evident.
For example, more women than men were infected, and the number infected increased with age.
Although prevalence varied substantially by region, predicted prevalence was mostly higher in developing regions than developed regions.

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of HSV-2 is relatively easy to measure since infection is lifelong and has a specific serological test.
The burden of disease is less easy to quantify.
Despite the often sparse data on which these estimates are based, it is clear that HSV-2 infection is widespread.
The dramatic differences in prevalence between regions are worthy of further exploration.

Title
The impact of user fees on health service utilization in low- and middle-income countries: how strong is the evidence?.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the effects of user charges on the uptake of health services in low- and middle-income countries.

METHODS
A systematic search of 25 social science, economics and health literature databases and other sources was performed to identify and appraise studies on the effects of introducing, removing, increasing or reducing user charges on the uptake of various health services in low- and middle-income countries.
Only experimental or quasi-experimental study designs were considered: cluster randomized controlled trials (C-RCT), controlled " before and after" (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies.
Papers were assessed in which the effect of the intervention was measured in terms of changes in service utilization (including equity outcomes), household expenditure or health outcomes.

FINDINGS
Sixteen studies were included: five CBA, two C-RCT and nine ITS.
Only studies reporting effects on health service utilization, sometimes across socioeconomic groups, were identified.
Removing or reducing user fees was found to increase the utilization of curative services and perhaps preventive services as well, but may have negatively impacted service quality.
Introducing or increasing fees reduced the utilization of some curative services, although quality improvements may have helped maintain utilization in some cases.
When fees were either introduced or removed, the impact was immediate and abrupt.
Studies did not adequately show whether such an increase or reduction in utilization was sustained over the longer term.
In addition, most of the studies were given low-quality ratings based on criteria adapted from those of the Cochrane Collaboration's Effective Practice and Organisation of Care group.

CONCLUSIONS
There is a need for more high-quality research examining the effects of changes in user fees for health services in low- and middle-income countries.

Title
Universal coverage of health services: tailoring its implementation.

Abstract
In 2005, the Member States of WHO adopted a resolution encouraging countries to develop health financing systems capable of achieving and/or maintaining universal coverage of health services - where all people have access to needed health services without the risk of severe financial consequences.
In doing this, a major challenge for many countries will be to move away from out-of-pocket payments, which are often used as an important source of fund collection.
Prepayment methods will need to be developed or expanded but, in addition to questions of revenue collection, specific attention will also have to be paid to pooling funds to spread risks and to enable their efficient and equitable use.
Developing prepayment mechanisms may take time, depending on countries' economic, social and political contexts.
Specific rules for health financing policy will need to be developed and implementing organizations will need to be tailored to the level that countries can support and sustain.
In this paper we propose a comprehensive framework focusing on health financing rules and organizations that can be used to support countries in developing their health financing systems in the search for universal coverage.

Title
Beyond fragmentation and towards universal coverage: insights from Ghana, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Abstract
The World Health Assembly of 2005 called for all health systems to move towards universal coverage, defined as " access to adequate health care for all at an affordable price" .
A crucial aspect in achieving universal coverage is the extent to which there are income and risk cross-subsidies in health systems.
Yet this aspect appears to be ignored in many of the policy prescriptions directed at low- and middle-income countries, often resulting in high degrees of health system fragmentation.
The aim of this paper is to explore the extent of fragmentation within the health systems of three African countries (Ghana, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania).
Using a framework for analysing health-care financing in terms of its key functions, we describe how fragmentation has developed, how each country has attempted to address the arising equity challenges and what remains to be done to promote universal coverage.
The analysis suggests that South Africa has made the least progress in addressing fragmentation, while Ghana appears to be pursuing a universal coverage policy in a more coherent way.
To achieve universal coverage, health systems must reduce their reliance on out-of-pocket payments, maximize the size of risk pools, and resource allocation mechanisms must be put in place to either equalize risks between individual insurance schemes or equitably allocate general tax (and donor) funds.
Ultimately, there needs to be greater integration of financing mechanisms to promote universal cover with strong income and risk cross-subsidies in the overall health system.

Title
Resource allocation and purchasing in the health sector: the English experience.

Abstract
The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has extensive experience in allocating health service funds to regions and localities using funding formulae.
This paper focuses on England.
Special attention is given to recent policy concerns to reduce avoidable health inequalities by broadening the remit of the resource allocation formulae.
The paper also examines the issues that arise when seeking to allocate funds to very small organizational units, such as general practices.
The English example is relevant to less-developed health systems, especially for those governments seeking to decentralize, to improve accountability and to promote equity.

Title
Contracting for health services: effects of utilization and quality on the costs of the Basic Package of Health Services in Afghanistan.

OBJECTIVE
To research the effects of changes in health service utilization and quality on the costs of the Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) in 13 provinces of Afghanistan.

METHODS
The study grouped data from 355 health facilities and more than 4000 health posts into 21 data points that represented 21 different nongovernmental organization contracts for service delivery between April 2006 and March 2007.
Data were pooled from five data sets on expenditure, service utilization, quality (i.e. client satisfaction and the availability of essential medicines and female health-care providers), pharmaceuticals, and security and remoteness scores.
Pearson's partial correlation and multiple linear regression models were used to examine correlations between expenditure and other study variables.

FINDINGS
Fixed costs were found to comprise most of the cost of BPHS contracts.
There was no correlation between cost and utilization rate or security.
The distance to the health facility was negatively correlated with costs (R² = 0.855, F-significance < 0.001).
The presence of female health workers, indicative of good quality in this cultural context, was negatively correlated with security (r = -0.70; P < 0.001).
There was a significant correlation between the use of curative services and client satisfaction but not between the use of preventive services and client satisfaction (R² = 0.389 and 0.272 for two types of health facilities studied).

CONCLUSION
Access to health services can be extended through contracting mechanisms in a post-conflict state even in the presence of security problems.
Service characteristics, geographical distance and the security situation failed to consistently explain, alone or in combination, the observed variations in per capita costs or visits.
Therefore, using these parameters as the basis for planning does not necessarily lead to better resource allocation.

Title
Community-based infant hearing screening for early detection of permanent hearing loss in Lagos, Nigeria: a cross-sectional study.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a community-based universal infant hearing screening programme for detecting permanent congenital and early-onset hearing loss (PCEHL) in Lagos, Nigeria.

METHODS
This is a cross-sectional study in which all infants aged 3 months or under attending four bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization clinics accounting for over 75% of the BCG coverage in the study location were screened by community health workers between July 2005 and April 2006.
Screening followed a two-stage protocol involving transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and automated auditory brainstem responses.
The main outcome measures were screening coverage, referral rates, return rates for second-stage screening and evaluation, yield and age at PCEHL diagnosis.

FINDINGS
In total, 2003 (88%) of 2277 eligible infants attending the four BCG clinics were successfully screened between July 2005 and April 2006 at a mean age of 17.7 days, with no parent declining screening.
The majority (55.2%) were born outside a hospital and, of such infants, 77% were born in traditional herbal maternity homes.
The overall referral rate for diagnostic evaluation was 4.1%.
Only 61% (50/82) of those referred returned for evaluation, and 45 of them were confirmed with PCEHL.
Additionally, 11 infants who had previously passed the first screening stage were also found to have PCEHL, resulting in a yield of 28 per 1000 (56/2003).
The mean age at diagnosis was 51 days.
The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of the first screening stage were 80.4%, 99.7% and 90.0%, respectively.
The positive likelihood ratio was 268, while the negative likelihood ratio was 0.2.

CONCLUSION
Routine hearing screening of infants attending BCG immunization clinics by community health workers was feasible and effective for the early detection of PCEHL in Lagos, Nigeria.
However, an efficient tracking and follow-up system is needed to improve return rates for second-stage screening and diagnostic evaluation.

Title
Validation of community health workers' assessment of neonatal illness in rural Bangladesh.

OBJECTIVE
To estimate the validity (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) of a clinical algorithm as used by community health workers (CHWs) to detect and classify neonatal illness during routine household visits in rural Bangladesh.

METHODS
CHWs evaluated breastfeeding and symptoms and signs of illness in 395 neonates selected randomly from neonatal illness surveillance during household visits on postnatal days 0, 2, 5 and 8.
Neonates classified with very severe disease (VSD) were referred to a community-based hospital.
Within 12 hours of CHW assessments, physicians independently evaluated all neonates seen in a given day by one CHW, randomly chosen from among 36 project CHWs.
Physicians recorded symptoms and signs of illness, classified the illness, and determined whether the newborn needed referral-level care at the hospital.
Physicians' identification and classification were used as the gold standard in determining the validity of CHWs' identification of symptoms and signs of illness and its classification.

FINDINGS
CHWs' classification of VSD showed a sensitivity of 73%, a specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 57% and a negative predictive value of 99%.
A maternal report of any feeding problem as ascertained by physician questioning was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with "not sucking at all" and "not attached at all" or "not well attached" as determined clinically by CHWs during feeding assessment.

CONCLUSION
CHWs identified with high validity the neonates with severe illness needing referral-level care.
Home-based illness recognition and management, including referral of neonates with severe illness by CHWs, is a promising strategy for improving neonatal health and survival in low-resource developing country settings.

Title
Improved access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care and its effect on institutional maternal mortality in rural Mali.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effect of a national referral system that aims to reduce maternal mortality rates through improving access to and the quality of emergency obstetric care in rural Mali (sub-Saharan Africa).

METHODS
A maternity referral system that included basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care, transportation to obstetric health services and community cost-sharing schemes was implemented in six rural health districts in Kayes region between December 2002 and November 2005.
In an uncontrolled "before and after" study, we recorded all obstetric emergencies, major obstetric interventions and maternal deaths during a 4-year observation period (1 January 2003 to 30 November 2006): the year prior to the intervention (P-1); the year of the intervention (P0), and 1 and 2 years after the intervention (P1 and P2, respectively).
The primary outcome was the risk of death among obstetric emergency patients, calculated with crude case fatality rates and crude odds ratios.
Analyses were adjusted for confounding variables using logistic regression.

FINDINGS
The number of women receiving emergency obstetric care doubled between P-1 and P2, and the rate of major obstetric interventions (mainly Caesarean sections) performed for absolute maternal indications increased from 0.13% in P-1 to 0.46% in P2.
In women treated for an obstetric emergency, the risk of death 2 years after implementing the intervention was half the risk recorded before the intervention (odds ratio, OR: 0.48; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.30-0.76).
Maternal mortality rates decreased more among women referred for emergency obstetric care than among those who presented to the district health centre without referral.
Nearly half (47.5%) of the reduction in deaths was attributable to fewer deaths from haemorrhage.

CONCLUSION
The intervention showed rapid effects due to the availability of major obstetric interventions in district health centres, reduced transport time to such centres for treatment, and reduced financial barriers to care.
Our results show that national programmes can be implemented in low-income countries without major external funding and that they can rapidly improve the coverage of obstetric services and significantly reduce the risk of death associated with obstetric complications.

Title
Verbal autopsy coding: are multiple coders better than one?.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the impact on the reported cause-of-death patterns of a verbal autopsy coding strategy based on a review of every death by multiple coders versus a single coder.

METHODS
Deaths in 45 villages (total population 180 162) in southern India were documented during 12 months in 2003-2004, and a standard verbal autopsy questionnaire was completed for each death.
Two physician coders, each unaware of the other's decisions, assigned an underlying cause of death in accordance with the causes listed in the chapter headings of the International classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision (ICD-10).
For the three chapter headings that applied to more than 100 of the deaths, agreement for subsets of causes of death within the chapter was also analysed.
In the event of discrepancies, a third coder was used to finalize a cause of death.
Cohen's kappa statistic (K) was used to measure levels of agreement between the two physician coders.

FINDINGS
In total, 1354 deaths were documented, and a verbal autopsy was completed for 1329 (98%) of them.
At the chapter heading level of the ICD-10, physician coders assigned the same cause to 1255 deaths (94%) (K = 0.93; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.94).
The patterns of death derived from the causes assigned by each physician were all very similar to the patterns obtained through the consensus process, with the rank order of the 10 leading causes of death being the same for all three coding methods.

CONCLUSION
Duplicate coding of verbal autopsy results has little advantage over a single-coder system for mortality surveillance or for identifying population patterns of death.
Resources could be better diverted to other parts of the mortality surveillance process, such as validation.

Title
Elimination of endemic measles transmission in Australia.

Abstract
Elimination of endemic measles transmission is the culmination of a range of control measures at a national level.
Current documentation of elimination proposed by WHO's regional offices requires achieving specific targets for surveillance process indicators.
We demonstrate how Australia, although not meeting these specific targets, has satisfied multiple criteria that justify the formal declaration of measles elimination.
Our review shows that few countries previously declaring measles elimination have satisfied the current WHO surveillance targets.
We argue that the requirements for recognition of measles elimination should not restrict countries to a particular type of surveillance system or surveillance criteria.

Title
Why first-level health workers fail to follow guidelines for managing severe disease in children in the Coast Region, the United Republic of Tanzania.

OBJECTIVE
To determine why health workers fail to follow integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) guidelines for severely ill children at first-level outpatient health facilities in rural areas of the United Republic of Tanzania.

METHODS
Retrospective and prospective case reviews of severely ill children aged < 5 years were conducted at health facilities in four districts.
We ascertained treatment and examined the characteristics associated with referral, conducted follow-up interviews with parents of severely ill children, and gave health workers questionnaires and interviews.

FINDINGS
In total, 502 cases were reviewed at 62 facilities.
Treatment with antimalarials and antibiotics was consistent with the diagnosis given by health workers.
However, of 240 children classified as having "very severe febrile disease", none received all IMCI-recommended therapies, and only 25% of severely ill children were referred.
Lethargy and anaemia diagnoses were independently associated with referral.
Most (91%) health workers indicated that certain severe conditions can be managed without referral.

CONCLUSION
The health workers surveyed rarely adhered to IMCI treatment and referral guidelines for children with severe illness.
They administered therapy based on narrow diagnoses rather than IMCI classifications, disagreed with referral guidelines and often considered referral unnecessary.
To improve implementation of IMCI, attention should focus on the reasons for health worker non-adherence.

Title
Pilot testing of WHO Child Growth Standards in Chandigarh: implications for India's child health programmes.

OBJECTIVE
To compare the prevalence of underweight as calculated from Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) growth curves (based on the Harvard scale) and the new WHO Child Growth Standards.

METHODS
We randomly selected 806 children under 6 years of age from 45 primary anganwadi (childcare) centres in Chandigarh, Punjab, India, that were chosen through multistage stratified random sampling.
Children were weighed, and their weight for age was calculated using IAP curves and WHO growth references.
Nutritional status according to the WHO Child Growth Standards was analysed using WHO Anthro statistical software (beta version, 17 February 2006).
The χ2 test was used to determine statistical significance at the 0.05 significance level.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of underweight (Z score less than -2) in the first 6 months of life was nearly 1.6 times higher when calculated in accordance with the new WHO standards rather than IAP growth curves.
For all ages combined, the estimated prevalence of underweight was 1.4 times higher when IAP standards instead of the new WHO standards were used.
Similarly, the prevalence of underweight in both sexes combined was 14.5% higher when IAP standards rather than the new WHO growth standards were applied (P < 0.001).
By contrast, severe malnutrition estimated for both sexes were 3.8 times higher when the new WHO standards were used in place of IAP standards (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION
The new WHO growth standards will project a lower prevalence of overall underweight children and provide superior growth tracking than IAP standards, especially in the first 6 months of life and among severely malnourished children.

Title
Neonatal mortality, risk factors and causes: a prospective population-based cohort study in urban Pakistan.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the prevalence, sex distribution and causes of neonatal mortality, as well as its risk factors, in an urban Pakistani population with access to obstetric and neonatal care.

METHODS
Study area women were enrolled at 20-26 weeks' gestation in a prospective population-based cohort study that was conducted from 2003 to 2005.
Physical examinations, antenatal laboratory tests and anthropometric measures were performed, and gestational age was determined by ultrasound to confirm eligibility.
Demographic and health data were also collected on pretested study forms by trained female research staff.
The women and neonates were seen again within 48 hours postpartum and at day 28 after the birth.
All neonatal deaths were reviewed using the Pattinson et al. system to assign obstetric and final causes of death; the circumstances of the death were determined by asking the mother or family and by reviewing hospital records.
Frequencies and rates were calculated, and 95% confidence intervals were determined for mortality rates.
Relative risks were calculated to evaluate the associations between potential risk factors and neonatal death.
Logistic regression models were used to compute adjusted odds ratios.

FINDINGS
Birth outcomes were ascertained for 1280 (94%) of the 1369 women enrolled.
The 28-day neonatal mortality rate was 47.3 per 1000 live births.
Preterm birth, Caesarean section and intrapartum complications were associated with neonatal death.
Some 45% of the deaths occurred within 48 hours and 73% within the first week.
The primary obstetric causes of death were preterm labour (34%) and intrapartum asphyxia (21%).
Final causes were classified as immaturity-related (26%), birth asphyxia or hypoxia (26%) and infection (23%).
Neither delivery in a health facility nor by health professionals was associated with fewer neonatal deaths.
The Caesarean section rate was 19%.
Almost all (88%) neonates who died received treatment and 75% died in the hospital.

CONCLUSION
In an urban population with good access to professional care, we found a high neonatal mortality rate, often due to preventable conditions.
These results suggest that, to decrease neonatal mortality, improved health service quality is crucial.

Title
Validation of an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithm for managing common skin conditions in Fiji.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the sensitivity of an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithm to detect common skin conditions in children in Fiji.

METHODS
We collected data from the assessments of children aged between 2 months and 5 years who presented to one of two health clinics.
Every child was assessed by a nurse trained in the use of the IMCI algorithm and also an expert paediatrician.
We used a kappa statistic to measure agreement between the nurse/algorithm assessment method and the paediatrician's diagnosis.

FINDINGS
High sensitivity for identifying skin problems (sensitivity: 98.7%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 95.5-99.9) was found for the algorithm applied by IMCI-trained nurses, who were able to identify the one child with a severe skin infection and all three children with periorbital cellulitis.
Sensitivity was high for the classification of abscess/cellulitis (sensitivity: 95%; 95% CI: 75.1-99.9) and infected scabies (sensitivity: 89.1%; 95% CI: 77.8-95.9), but lower for identification of impetigo, fungal infection and, in particular, non-infected scabies.

CONCLUSION
The IMCI skin algorithm is a robust tool that should be incorporated into the IMCI after some modifications relating to scabies and impetigo.
Its use by primary health-care workers will reduce the burden of skin diseases in children in Fiji through improved case identification and management.
The algorithm should be considered in other countries where skin diseases in children are a priority, particularly in the Pacific region.

Title
New methods for estimating the tuberculosis case detection rate in high-HIV prevalence countries: the example of Kenya.

OBJECTIVE
To develop new methods for estimating the sputum smear-positive tuberculosis case detection rate (CDR) in a country where infection with HIV is prevalent.

METHODS
We estimated the smear-positive tuberculosis CDR in HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults, and in all adults in Kenya.
Data on time trends in tuberculosis case notification rates and on HIV infection prevalence in adults and in tuberculosis patients were used, along with data on tuberculosis control programme performance.

FINDINGS
In 2006, the estimated smear-positive tuberculosis CDR in HIV-negative adults was 79% (95% confidence interval, CI: 64-94) and in HIV-positive adults, 57% (95% CI: 26-88), giving a weighted mean of 68% (95% CI: 49-87).
The separate estimate for all smear-positive tuberculosis cases was 72% (95% CI: 53-91), giving an overall average for the three estimates of 70% (95% CI: 58-82).
As the tuberculosis CDR in 1996 was 57% (95% CI: 47-67), the estimated increase by 2006 was 13 percentage points (95% CI: 6-20), or 23%.
This increase was accompanied by a more than doubling of the resources devoted to tuberculosis control in Kenya, including facilities and staff.

CONCLUSION
Using three approaches to estimate the tuberculosis CDR in a country where HIV infection is prevalent, we showed that expansion of the tuberculosis control programme in Kenya led to an increase of 23% in the CDR between 1996 and 2006.
While the methods developed here can be applied in other countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection, they rely on precise data on trends in such prevalence in the general population and among tuberculosis patients.

Title
Cost-effectiveness of oral cancer screening: results from a cluster randomized controlled trial in India.

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate oral cancer screening by visual inspection.

METHODS
A cluster randomized controlled trial was initiated in Trivandrum district, Kerala, India.
Of 13 population clusters, seven were randomly allocated to three rounds of screening between 1996 and 2004, while standard care was provided in six (control arm).
An activity-based approach was employed to calculate costs associated with various components of the screening trial.
Information on the resources used and on clinical events in each trial arm was derived from trial databases.
Total costs for each cluster were estimated in 2004 United States dollars (US$).
The incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated for all eligible individuals and for high-risk individuals (i.e. tobacco or alcohol users).

FINDINGS
The proportion of oral cancers detected at an early stage (i.e. stage I or II) was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm (42% versus 24%, respectively).
The incremental cost per life-year saved was US$ 835 for all individuals eligible for screening and US$ 156 for high-risk individuals.
Oral cancer screening by visual inspection was performed for under US$ 6 per person.

CONCLUSION
The most cost-effective approach to oral cancer screening by visual inspection is to offer it to the high-risk population.
Targeted screening of this group will ensure that screening can be offered at a reasonable cost in a limited-resource setting.

Title
What essential medicines for children are on the shelf?.

OBJECTIVE
To document the inclusion of key medicines for children in national essential medicines lists (EMLs) and standard treatment guidelines, and to assess the availability and cost of these medicines in 14 countries in central Africa.

METHODS
Surveys were conducted in 12 public and private sector medicine outlets in each country's capital city.
Data were collected on medicine availability on the survey day and on the cost to the patient of the lowest priced medicine in stock.

FINDINGS
The proportion of survey medicines in national EMLs ranged from 50% to 90%.
In only three countries were more than 50% of such medicines available from central medical stores (range: 15-75%).
Availability in nongovernmental organization stores was not consistently better (range: 10-65%) but tended to be higher in teaching hospitals, although the range was similar (15-70%).
District hospitals (range: 10-80%) had slightly better availability than teaching hospitals, while primary health care clinics generally had poorer availability (range: 18-48%).
Retail or private pharmacies tended to have more survey medicines available (range: 38-62%).
There was considerable variability in prices, which tended to be higher in retail pharmacies.

CONCLUSION
The availability of key essential medicines for children was poor.
Better understanding of the supply systems in the countries studied and of the pattern of demand for medicines is needed before improvements can be made.
Medicines must be available, affordable and acceptable to patients.
Substantial progress towards Millennium Development Goals will not occur without a major effort to improve access to medicines for children.

Title
The lifetime risk of maternal mortality: concept and measurement.

OBJECTIVE
The lifetime risk of maternal mortality, which describes the cumulative loss of life due to maternal deaths over the female life course, is an important summary measure of population health.
However, despite its interpretive appeal, the lifetime risk of dying from maternal causes can be defined and calculated in various ways.
A clear and concise discussion of both its underlying concept and methods of measurement is badly needed.

METHODS
I define and compare a variety of procedures for calculating the lifetime risk of maternal mortality.
I use detailed survey data from Bangladesh in 2001 to illustrate these calculations and compare the properties of the various risk measures.
Using official UN estimates of maternal mortality for 2005, I document the differences in lifetime risk derived with the various measures.

FINDINGS
Taking sub-Saharan Africa as an example, the range of estimates for the 2005 lifetime risk extends from 3.41% to 5.76%, or from 1 in 29 to 1 in 17.
The highest value resulted from the method used for producing official UN estimates for the year 2000.
The measure recommended here has an intermediate value of 4.47%, or 1 in 22.

CONCLUSION
There are strong reasons to consider the calculation method proposed here more accurate and appropriate than earlier procedures.
Accordingly, it was adopted for use in producing the 2005 UN estimates of the lifetime risk of maternal mortality.
By comparison, the method used for the 2000 UN estimates appears to overestimate this important measure of population health by around 20%.

Title
How does satisfaction with the health-care system relate to patient experience?.

OBJECTIVE
To explore what determines people's satisfaction with the health-care system above and beyond their experience as patients.

METHODS
Data on health system responsiveness, which refers to the manner and environment in which people are treated when they seek health care, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the determinants of people's satisfaction with the health-care system and how strongly this is influenced by an individual's experience as a patient.
The data were obtained from 21 European Union countries in the World Health Survey for 2003.
Additive ordinary least-squares regression models were used to assess the extent to which variables commonly associated with satisfaction with the health-care system, as recorded in the literature, explain the variation around the concept of satisfaction.
A residual analysis was used to identify other predictors of satisfaction with the health-care system.

FINDINGS
Patient experience was significantly associated with satisfaction with the health-care system and explained 10.4% of the variation around the concept of satisfaction.
Other factors such as patient expectations, health status, type of care, and immunization coverage were also significant predictors of health system satisfaction; although together they explained only 17.5% of the observed variation, while broader societal factors may largely account for the unexplained portion of satisfaction with the health-care system.

CONCLUSION
Contrary to published reports, people's satisfaction with the health-care system depends more on factors external to the health system than on the experience of care as a patient.
Thus, measuring the latter may be of limited use as a basis for quality improvement and health system reform.

Title
Estimating pregnancy-related mortality from census data: experience in Latin America.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the feasibility of measuring maternal mortality in countries lacking accurate birth and death registration through national population censuses by a detailed evaluation of such data for three Latin American countries.

METHODS
We used established demographic techniques, including the general growth balance method, to evaluate the completeness and coverage of the household death data obtained through population censuses.
We also compared parity to cumulative fertility data to evaluate the coverage of recent household births.
After evaluating the data and adjusting it as necessary, we calculated pregnancy-related mortality ratios (PRMRs) per 100 000 live births and used them to estimate maternal mortality.

FINDINGS
The PRMRs for Honduras (2001), Nicaragua (2005) and Paraguay (2002) were 168, 95 and 178 per 100 000 live births, respectively.
Surprisingly, evaluation of the data for Nicaragua and Paraguay showed overreporting of adult deaths, so a downward adjustment of 20% to 30% was required.
In Honduras, the number of adult female deaths required substantial upward adjustment.
The number of live births needed minimal adjustment.
The adjusted PRMR estimates are broadly consistent with existing estimates of maternal mortality from various data sources, though the comparison varies by source.

CONCLUSION
Census data can be used to measure pregnancy-related mortality as a proxy for maternal mortality in countries with poor death registration.
However, because our data were obtained from countries with reasonably good statistical systems and literate populations, we cannot be certain the methods employed in the study will be equally useful in more challenging environments.
Our data evaluation and adjustment methods worked, but with considerable uncertainty.
Ways of quantifying this uncertainty are needed.

Title
Population-based simulations of influenza pandemics: validity and significance for public health policy.

OBJECTIVE
To examine the validity and usefulness of pandemic simulations aimed at informing practical decision-making in public health.

METHODS
We recruited a multidisciplinary group of nine experts to assess a case-study simulation of influenza transmission in a Swedish county.
We used a non-statistical nominal group technique to generate evaluations of the plausibility, formal validity (verification) and predictive validity of the simulation.
A health-effect assessment structure was used as a framework for data collection.

FINDINGS
The unpredictability of social order during disasters was not adequately addressed by simulation methods; even minor disruptions of the social order may invalidate key infrastructural assumptions underpinning current pandemic simulation models.
Further, a direct relationship between model flexibility and computation time was noted.
Consequently, simulation methods cannot, in practice, support integrated modifications of microbiological, epidemiological and spatial submodels or handle multiple parallel scenarios.

CONCLUSION
The combination of incomplete surveillance data and simulation methods that neglect social dynamics limits the ability of national public health agencies to provide policy-makers and the general public with the critical and timely information needed during a pandemic.

Title
The rationale for integrated childhood meningoencephalitis surveillance: a case study from Cambodia.

PROBLEM
Recent progress in vaccine availability and affordability has raised prospects for reducing death and disability from neurological infections in children.
In many Asian countries, however, the epidemiology and public health burden of neurological diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and bacterial meningitis are poorly understood.

APPROACH
A sentinel surveillance system for Japanese encephalitis was developed and embedded within the routine meningoencephalitis syndromic surveillance system in Cambodia in 2006.
The sentinel surveillance system was designed so surveillance and laboratory testing for other etiologies of neurological infection could be incorporated.

LOCAL SETTING
The Communicable Disease Control department of the Ministry of Health in Cambodia worked with partners to establish the sentinel surveillance system.

RELEVANT CHANGES
The sentinel surveillance system has provided important information on the disease burden of Japanese encephalitis in Cambodia and is now providing a platform for expansion to incorporate laboratory testing for other vaccine-preventable neurological infections in children.

LESSONS LEARNED
Sentinel surveillance systems, when linked to syndromic reporting systems, can characterize the epidemiology of meningoencephalitis and identify the proportion of hospital-based neurological infection in children that is vaccine preventable.
Integrated systems enable consistency in data collection, analysis and information dissemination, and they enhance the capacity of public health managers to provide more credible and integrated information to policy-makers.
This will assist decision-making about the potential role of immunization in reducing the incidence of childhood neurological infections.

Title
Global childhood unintentional injury surveillance in four cities in developing countries: a pilot study.

OBJECTIVE
To determine the frequency and nature of childhood injuries and to explore the risk factors for such injuries in low-income countries by using emergency department (ED) surveillance data.

METHODS
This pilot study represents the initial phase of a multi-country global childhood unintentional injury surveillance (GCUIS) project and was based on a sequential sample of children < 11 years of age of either gender who presented to selected EDs in Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt and Pakistan over a 3-4 month period, which varied for each site, in 2007.

FINDINGS
Of 1559 injured children across all sites, 1010 (65%) were male; 941 (60%) were aged > 5 years, 32 (2%) were < 1 year old.
Injuries were especially frequent (34%) during the morning hours.
They occurred in and around the home in 56% of the cases, outside while children played in 63% and during trips in 11%.
Of all the injuries observed, 913 (56%) involved falls; 350 (22%), road traffic injuries; 210 (13%), burns; 66 (4%), poisoning; and 20 (1%), near drowning or drowning.
Falls occurred most often from stairs or ladders; road traffic injuries most often involved pedestrians; the majority of burns were from hot liquids; poisonings typically involved medicines, and most drowning occurred in the home.
The mean injury severity score was highest for near drowning or drowning (11), followed closely by road traffic injuries (10).
There were 6 deaths, of which 2 resulted from drowning, 2 from falls and 2 from road traffic injuries.

CONCLUSION
Hospitals in low-income countries bear a substantial burden of childhood injuries, and systematic surveillance is required to identify the epidemiological distribution of such injuries and understand their risk factors.
Methodological standardization for surveillance across countries makes it possible to draw international comparisons and identify common issues.
