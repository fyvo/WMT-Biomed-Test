Abstract
Surveillance for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in low- and middle-income countries started in the 1980s.
However, the questions of whether the results of HIV tests should be given to participants, and if so how, has still not been resolved.
In the absence of effective treatment, it was considered acceptable to withhold results from HIV-positive participants.
However, when antiretroviral treatment is available, some argue for beneficence - that it is the researcher's duty to return the test results to all those who provide samples for surveillance.
The corollary is that only participants who wish to receive their test results would be eligible to participate in surveys.
Others argue for autonomy - that to obtain a more representative result for the general population, surveys should not exclude participants who do not wish to receive their test results.
This round table discussion takes a closer look at those two arguments.
We believe that the global community should work towards routine feedback of HIV surveillance while ensuring that participants receive and understand their test results.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the number one cause of disability worldwide and is comorbid with many chronic diseases, including obesity/metabolic syndrome (MetS).
Women have twice as much risk for MDD and comorbidity with obesity/MetS as men, although pathways for understanding this association remain unclear.
On the basis of clinical and preclinical studies, we argue that prenatal maternal stress (ie, excess glucocorticoid expression and associated immune responses) that occurs during the sexual differentiation of the fetal brain has sex-dependent effects on brain development within highly sexually dimorphic regions that regulate mood, stress, metabolic function, the autonomic nervous system, and the vasculature.
Furthermore, these effects have lifelong consequences for shared sex-dependent risk of MDD and obesity/MetS.
Thus, we propose that there are shared biologic substrates at the anatomical, molecular, and/or genetic levels that produce the comorbid risk for MDD-MetS through sex-dependent fetal origins.


Abstract
Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of mood disorders, basic and clinical research studies have begun to elucidate the pathophysiology of depression and to identify rapid, efficacious antidepressant agents.
Stress and depression are associated with neuronal atrophy, characterized by loss of synaptic connections in key cortical and limbic brain regions implicated in depression. This is thought to occur in part via decreased expression and function of growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus.
These structural alterations are difficult to reverse with typical antidepressants.
However, recent studies demonstrate that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that produces rapid antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant depressed patients, rapidly increases spine synapses in the PFC and reverses the deficits caused by chronic stress.
This is thought to occur by disinhibition of glutamate transmission, resulting in a rapid but transient burst of glutamate, followed by an increase in BDNF release and activation of downstream signaling pathways that stimulate synapse formation.
Recent work demonstrates that the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, are also associated with increased glutamate transmission and synapse formation.
These findings have resulted in testing and identification of additional targets and agents that influence glutamate transmission and have rapid antidepressant actions in rodent models and in clinical trials.
Together these studies have created tremendous excitement and hope for a new generation of rapid, efficacious antidepressants.


Abstract
Influenza A virus vaccines currently contain a mixture of isolates that reflect the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the currently circulating strains.
This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a trivalent inactivated swine influenza virus vaccine (Flusure XP) in pigs challenged with a contemporary α-cluster H1N1 field isolate of Canadian swine origin.
Pigs were allocated to vaccinated, placebo, and negative-control groups and monitored for respiratory disease for 5 d after challenge.
On the challenge day and 5 d after challenge the serum of the vaccinated pigs had reciprocal hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers 40 for all the vaccine viruses but ≤ 20 for the challenge virus.
Gross lesions were present in the lungs of all pigs that had been inoculated with the challenge virus, but the proportion of lung tissue consolidated did not differ significantly between the placebo and vaccinated pigs.
However, the amount of virus was significantly reduced in the nasal secretions, lungs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the vaccinated pigs compared with the placebo pigs.
These results indicate that swine vaccinated with Flusure XP were partially protected against experimental challenge with a swine α-cluster H1N1 virus that is genetically similar to viruses currently circulating in Canadian swine.


Abstract
Tissue expansion using implantable expanders is a useful means of generating surplus tissue for reconstruction of defects such as scarring following burns.
The authors describe their technique of incisions distant to the desired location of expander placement, and remote dissection of the expander pocket with hydrodissection and blunt forceps.
A total of 81 expanders were placed in 30 consecutive patients, 81% of whom had burn scars due for reconstruction.
During preparation, no complications, such as bleeding, were encountered, except one case with severe subdermal fibrosis, in which bleeding was stopped through brief application of pressure.
Postoperatively, no complications were encountered in 76% of patients; however, 16.6% exhibited surgical site infection, which was managed conservatively and was correlated with a high number of expanders implanted at once.
One patient experienced hematoma formation that resolved spontaneously, and one instance of expander extrusion and subsequent removal occurred.
Receiving ≥2 expanders at the same time was statistically associated with higher risk for complication(s).
The authors' complication rates were moderate and comparable with open or endoscopic approaches.
Time of expansion is reduced compared with the open approach due to distant incision placement and immediate usability.
Cost effectiveness appeared to be better using only inexpensive forceps, rather than elaborate and costly endoscopic equipment.


Abstract
At the end of 2008, a left colectomy clinical pathway was implemented at Clinique Saint-Joseph (CHC) in Liège (Belgium).
A sample of 213 patients with benign or malignant pathology requiring laparoscopic left colon resection was included in this clinical pathway during the years 2009 to 2015.
We focused on the compliance with the protocol, on the complication rate and the incidence of re-hospitalization within 30 days after surgery.
In comparison with a historical control group, we observed that the compliance was excellent (superior to 80 %) from 2009 to 2015.
The re-hospitalization did not differ though the complication rate decreased.
Although the hospital stay was not our primary objective, it decreased significantly from 8 to 4 days (average).
This analysis leads to the conclusion that the introduction of a clinical pathway, when it is well prepared and brings together all the implicated persons with the same goal, is directly beneficial to the patient and the quality of its management.


Abstract
Since a couple of years, the term Big Data describes technologies to extract knowledge from data.
Applications of Big Data and their consequences are also increasingly discussed in the mass media.
Because medicine is an empirical science, we discuss the meaning of Big Data and its potential for future medical research.


Abstract
Choroidal metastasis represents the most common type of intraocular malignancy and preferably involves the posterior uveal tract.
Breast and lung cancer - known or so far undiagnosed - are most frequently identified as the underlying tumor disease.
The majority of patients diagnosed with uveal metastasis have additional metastatic manifestations elsewhere, so re-staging before treatment is recommended.
The importance of a multidisciplinary approach is obvious.
Early diagnosis and timely initiation of treatment are mandatory in case of vision-threatening situations.
External beam radiation remains the therapy of choice.
Overall survival of patients with uveal metastasis is limited, averaging six to twelve months.
The other eye is frequently enough affected as well, justifying regular ophthalmologic follow-up during the further course of the disease.


Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysfunctions in social interactions resulting from a complex interplay between immunogenetic and environmental risk factors.
Autoimmunity has been proposed as a major etiological component of ASD.
Whether specific autoantibodies directed against brain targets are involved in ASD remains an open question.
Here, we identified within a cohort an ASD patient with multiple circulating autoantibodies, including the well-characterized one against glutamate NMDA receptor (NMDAR-Ab).
The patient exhibited alexithymia and previously suffered from two major depressive episodes without psychotic symptoms.
Using a single molecule-based imaging approach, we demonstrate that neither NMDAR-Ab type G immunoglobulin purified from the ASD patient serum, nor that from a seropositive healthy subject, disorganize membrane NMDAR complexes at synapses.
These findings suggest that the autistic patient NMDAR-Abs do not play a direct role in the etiology of ASD and that other autoantibodies directed against neuronal targets should be investigated.


Abstract
The H5N1 influenza viruses infect a range of avian species and have recently been isolated from humans and pigs.
In this study we generated a replication-defective recombinant adenovirus (rAd-H5HA-EGFP) expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H5N1 A/Swine/Fujian/1/2001 (SW/FJ/1/01) and evaluated its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in BALB/c mice. The recombinant virus induced high levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody at a median tissue culture infective dose of 10(8) or 10(7).
Compared with mice in the control groups, the mice vaccinated with rAd-H5HA-EGFP did not show apparent weight loss after challenge with either the homologous SW/FJ/1/01 or the heterologous H5N1 A/Chicken/Hunan/77/2005 (CK/HuN/77/05).
Replication of the challenge virus was partially or completely inhibited, and viruses were detected at significantly lower numbers in the organs of the vaccinated mice, all of which survived the challenge with CK/HuN/77/05, whereas most of the control mice did not.
These results indicate that rAd-H5HA-EGFP can provide effective immune protection from highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in mice and is therefore a promising new candidate vaccine against H5N1 influenza in animals.


Abstract
Primary peritonitis remains a rare disease in otherwise healthy children, with group A Streptococcus (GAS) being a particularly unusual cause.
A case involving a 14-year-old girl, who presented with an 'acute abdomen' and was taken to the operating room for urgent laparoscopy, is reported.
Abdominal and pelvic structures were only minimally inflamed, as was the appendix.
Peritoneal fluid and blood cultures both grew pure cultures of GAS.
The patient's course was complicated by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
She fortunately made a full recovery.
The present report highlights the diagnostic and treatment dilemmas associated with GAS primary peritonitis.


Abstract
A study of the anatomy of the fasciocutaneous branch of the third perforator artery of the deep femoral artery was performed to help the elaboration of a fasciocutaneous flap for the reconstruction of skin and subcutaneous and deep fascia of the knee and popliteal region.
Forty thighs in 27 fresh cadavers were dissected.
In all of the thighs, the third perforator artery was found to arise from the deep femoral artery and reach the posterior aspect of the thigh after perforating the adductor magnus muscle.
At that point it was also found that the third perforator artery gives off a branch that emerges through the intermuscular septum between the vast lateral muscle and the long head of the biceps femoral muscle, then crosses the posterior cutaneous nerve and moves directly on to perforate the deep fascia and then to bifurcate into two other branches: one ascending and one descending.
The cutaneous area of the flap of the thigh's posterior region, nourished by the fasciocutaneous branch, was evaluated through the injection of dye.
Dying of the upper medial, middle medial, lower medial and lower lateral areas of the flap was not successful in all of the dissected thighs. Nevertheless, the upper lateral and the middle lateral areas were dyed successfully in all 40 dissected thighs of the 27 cadavers.


Abstract
Cardiac rehabilitation is a well-defined multidisciplinary program with the objective to reduce mortality and morbidity, while also improving the exercise capacity and quality of life of the patient following a myocardial infarction.
Despite the fact that a cardiovascular rehabilitation program is now recommended by international guidelines for all patients who have suffered from an acute coronary syndrome, only half of all patients actually participate to such a program in Switzerland.
Even worse, especially when taking into consideration the population in Geneva, less than 5 % of patients follow a long-term cardiac maintenance program (phase III).
Since 2015, our project has been to encourage patients who have completed a phase II cardiac rehabilitation program, to resume regular physical activity in the long term.


Abstract
This article provides an overview of the conceptual foundations of measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents in child and adolescent psychiatry, and of the current state of research in this field.
The available procedures for determining quality of life are presented according to their areas of use and their psychometric characteristics.
The internationally available generic instruments for measuring HRQoL in children are identified and assessed in terms of their strengths and weaknesses with regard to selected criteria.
As a result, seven generic HRQoL instruments and two utility procedures have been identified which satísfy the following criteria: (i) psychometric qualíty; (ii) age-appropriate measurement; (iii) versions for self-reporting and external rating; and (iv) cross-cultural measurement.
The identified instruments satisfy the individual criteria to different degrees.
They are increasingly being used in health services research, treatment studies, and epidemiological research; however, they are not yet widely used as part of the clinical routine in child and adolescent psychiatrics.


Abstract
Physicians can assess the risk of fracture based on bone density (BMD) and several risk factors. Some of them and BMD are incorporated into FRAX.
BMD didn't take into account the microarchitecture.
TBS is a texture parameter related to bone microarchitecture.
A low TBS is associated with a history of fracture and the incidence of new fracture independently of BMD, clinical risk factors and FRAX.
TBS is yet integrated in the FRAX tool, and this effect is of greatest utility for individuals who are close to an intervention threshold.
It is particularly useful for the evaluation of secondary osteoporosis, including type 2 diabetes, Gluco-corticoïd induced osteoporosis.
It responds to osteoporosis treatments and is not influenced by lumbar degenerative disorders.


Abstract
This article aims to detail the major innovations occurred in Gastro-enterology in 2016, including the introduction of a new molecule, the vonoprazan, for the treatment of refractory gastroesophagal reflux disease (GERD) and a new way of eradication of H. pylori.
The possibility to use an intermittent dose of PPI rather than continuously in severe gastric and duodenal ulcers after successful endoscopic hemostasis is also discussed as well as the withdrawal of corticosteroids in the treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis. The formulation of corticosteroids in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, the interest of the chromo-endoscopy during colonoscopy highlighting small polyps (from 1 to 5 mm = « diminutive polyps ») and the introduction on the Swiss market for biosimilars in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are also discussed.


Abstract
Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasingly numerous, especially in the elderly population.
Surprisingly, this situation is often under-recognized or even neglected in clinical practice.
Yet, most oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents have limitations in case of renal impairment, either because they require a dose reduction, or are contra-indicated mainly for safety reasons.
This clinical case gives the opportunity to discuss the modalities of prescription and cautions to be taken when using most commonly prescribed OAD, metformin, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas, repaglinide), DPP-4 inhibitors (gliptins) and SGLT2 inhibitors, in a patient with T2D and CKD.


Abstract
For thousands of years, cocoa have been a very popular food and has been linked to various beneficial health effects.
Observational and epidemiological studies point towards a beneficial effect of dark chocolate on cardiovascular morbidity.
Several small, albeit controlled studies indeed demonstrate an amelioration of endothelial dysfunction - the dysfunction of the inner layer of the vessels - after intake of dark, flavanol-rich chocolate.
This is important, as endothelial dysfunction is an important marker of the development of atherosclerosis and an important prognosticator of future cardiovascular events.
This article summarizes the actual literature in this respect.


Abstract
Oral probiotic administration has been advocated for treatment and prevention of a diverse range of disorders.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on outcome of pediatric post-burn patients.
Forty thermally-injured pediatric patients with total body surface burns between 20-50% and depth between 5-10% were randomized in a prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial into two even groups: probiotic group (n=20), who received probiotic preparations, and placebo control group (n=20).
Clinical outcomes, including GIT tolerance, incidence of infection, need for grafting, length of hospital stay and mortality were recorded.
Laboratory measurements of serum CRP, serum albumin, serum IgA and total lymphocyte count were done upon admission and on days 4, 7 and 14.
There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age (3.67 ± 0.67 vs. 3.56 ± 0.73), sex, %BSA (34.5 ± 1.96 vs. 33.9 ± 1.82) and %deep burns (6.95 ± 0.34 vs. 7.25 ± 0.39).
Frequency of diarrhea (3 vs. 9), need for grafting (2 vs. 8) and length of hospital stay (17.25 ± 0.5 days vs. 21.9 ± 2.2 days) were significantly lower in the probiotic group (p=0.038, p=0.028 and p=0.044, respectively).
A trend towards a decrease in incidence of infections (7 vs. 12) was noted in the probiotic group (p=0.113).
There was no mortality in our series.
There was improvement in the patients' overall outcome related to wound healing and length of hospital stay following the use of probiotics.
However, their effects on infectious morbidity and mortality remain unclear and require further investigation.


Abstract
Depression is one of the most frequently encountered psychiatric disease in the primary care setting, source of enormous suffering for the ill and for his/her entourage.
Classical features of the disease in women are usually well known.
This article's goal is to highlight the masculine specificities of depression, sometimes poorly known.


Abstract
Biliary infections are a common cause of emergency department visit, usually of benign evolution but that can sometimes progress rapidly to a life-threatening emergency.The mainstay of treatment of acute cholecystitis is urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed in 72 hours.Antibiotic treatment is often sufficient for the initial treatment of mild cholangitis.
A percutaneous or endoscopic biliary drainage must be done urgently in case of severe presentations or if the patient doesn't respond to conservative treatment.
The definitive treatment of the cause of cholangitis, will be performed in a second time.


Abstract
Nausea is a common symptom among patients affected by chronic diseases or undergoing various treatments.
Because nausea can result from many origins, there is a large differential diagnosis to explore.
Its pathophysiology relies on numerous neurotransmitters, on which 5 types of antiemetic antagonists are effective (NK-1 receptor antagonists, antiserotoninergic, antidopaminergic, antihistaminic and anticholinergic agents).
Glucocorticoids and benzodiazepines are also used to treat some types of nausea.
Choosing the appropriate antiemetic can improve quality of life and treatment compliance.


Abstract
despite fluctuations, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis has significantly increased during the last decades in industrialized nations worldwide (1 to 15 %), which has a significant impact on the cost of healthcare.
This increased prevalence is mainly explained by diet modifications.
Environmental, metabolic and genetic factors may also influence the formation of kidney stones.
As a consequence, the medical management of this disease is preferentially multidisciplinary and involves urologists, nephrologists, radiologists, biologists and dietitians.
Urological management : may be mandatory during any acute and/or remote phase of an episode of renal colic, in case of residual stones.
Several techniques are available: insertion of double J stent, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy (flexible or rigid), percutaneous nephrolithotomy and more occasionally, open surgery.
Nephrological management: is justified in the course of the acute episode and aims to identify the causal factor(s) of kidney stones formation.
The diagnostic approach involves a thorough interrogation (personal medical and surgical history, details of the kidney stone disease and family medical history) as well as a metabolic assessment.
Moreover, given the high rate of recurrence (about 50 % within 5 to 10 years), individualized secondary prevention measures are necessary.
The recommendations should take into account the identified risk factors and any metabolic abnormalities.


Abstract
The paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a rare disease.
It is caused by the presence of autoantibodies creating an inflammatory reaction of the predominant brain parenchyma in the meso-temporal lobe and in other parts of the limbic system.
Its presence requires looking for an underlying tumour.
The management of this paraneoplastic syndrome includes an immunosuppressive therapy in addition to the treatment of the underlying tumour.
However, the management of this disease is not yet standardized.


Abstract
The development of a Canadian competency-based medical education (CBME) curriculum in obstetrics and gynaecology, slated to begin in 2017, must be rooted in, and aligned with, the principles of CanMEDS 2015 and Competence by Design.
It must also reflect the unique realities of the practice of the specialty.
The Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has been at the forefront of the movement to design and implement competency-based training for obstetrics and gynaecology.
The Dutch curriculum represents a practical example of how such a program could be developed.
Several CBME curricular initiatives have now also begun across Canada.


Abstract
The purpose of this study was to manually measure corneal thickness in canine eyes using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) device and to assess intra- and inter-observer reliability of this technique.
Twenty healthy dogs with a mean age of 4.7 y were examined.
A 6-mm corneal pachymetry protocol was carried out by 1 operator using 1 SD-OCT device in both eyes of each animal.
Measurements were obtained manually and in duplicate by 2 independent investigators (


Abstract
To improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, many national TB programmes have committed to deploying Xpert(®) MTB/RIF.
Implementation of this relatively new technology has suffered from a lack of comprehensive technical assistance, however, including the formulation of policies and plans to address operational issues.
While providing technical assistance, we observed numerous operational challenges in the implementation and scale-up of Xpert in five sub-Saharan African countries: low coverage, poor laboratory infrastructure, limited access, poor linkages to treatment, inadequate data on outcomes, problems with specimen transport, diagnostic algorithms that are not aligned with updated World Health Organization recommendations on target patient groups and financing challenges.
We recommend better country preparedness and training, laboratory information and quality systems, supply management and referral mechanisms.


Abstract
Adrenal tumours are rare and their management is challenging.
Every patient presenting with adrenal mass or symptoms of hormones hypersecretion should be investigated.
The two important questions to be answered are : 1. Is the tumour secreting ?
Is the tumour malignant or not ?
A complete endocrine work-up and a nativ CT-scan may usually answer these two questions but have to be interpreted by specialists in a multidisciplinary team setting.
The decisions about managements of adrenal pathologies do follow international guidelines which are regularly updated.
It is not recommended to perform diagnostic or surgical procedure before excluding pheochromocytoma or adrenocortical carcinoma which could have fatal outcome for the patient.
Every adrenal mass has to be investigated and should not be made commonplace.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tulathromycin as a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) metaphylactic treatment on rumen fluid parameters in feedlot cattle in an intensive livestock production farm.
One hundred beef cattle, immediately after housing, were divided in 2 equal groups: 50 animals with metaphylactic treatment against BRD (treated group; tulathromycin at 2.5 mg/kg BW) and 50 animals with placebo treatment (control group).
Rumen fluid samples were collected from each animal by rumenocentesis in 3 periods: 1 d (T1), 8 d (T8), and 15 d (T15) after treatment.
Rumen pH was determined by ruminal fluid using portable pH meter.
Total volatile fatty acids (total VFA) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
All animals were singularly weighed at T1 and T15.
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine significant effects of treatment (treated group versus control group) and period (T1, T8, and T15) on rumen fluid parameters and body weight.
No clinical signs of BRD or other related diseases were recorded during the periods of study from any animal.
Statistically significant differences (P


Abstract
A study was carried out regarding 213 patients of either gender and all ages who presented with post-burn contractures.
The commonest site of contracture was the neck.
92 patients (43.19%) had received their initial burn injury management in general surgery units in tertiary care hospitals compared to 43 patients (20.18%) in district headquarter hospitals.
Only 26 patients (12.20%) were managed in plastic surgery/burn wards, and 52 patients (24.41%) received no regular treatment from any hospital.
The majority of patients (n=197) had a history of conservative management, with only 16 patients (7.51%) having a split thickness skin graft for part of their initial burns.
None of the patients had the appropriate anti-deformity splintage in the affected parts or any physiotherapy during the acute phase of their burns.


Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) concerns about 10 % of the population in Switzerland.
Epidemiological studies suggest that women are less prone to the development of CKD than men, and progress less rapidly to end stage renal disease.
The reasons for this finding may stem from hormonal, structural or hemodynamic differences, yet the precise underlying mechanisms are so far incompletely understood.
Some animal studies suggest a potentially beneficial effect of estrogen therapy, mainly in diabetes, yet data in humans are lacking.
This article provides an overview of epidemiological data and the different hypotheses concerning gender differences in CKD, and discusses the eventual benefits of estrogen therapy to retard CKD progression.


Abstract
Obstetrical anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) can lead to sexual dysfunction.
Literature is poor concerning long-term consequences of OASIS on female sexuality.
The objective of this paper is to clarify long-term consequences of OASIS on sexual function.
Dyspareunia and lubrication troubles are constantly reported based on articles reviewed in literature through Pubmed. Nevertheless, global sexual function seems not to be influenced by OASIS on a long-term basis.
Therefore, sexual dysfunctions must be specifically analysed in women's follow-up after OASIS.


Abstract
The objective was to study the clinical profile of high voltage electrical injuries in Kashmir, and various prevention and safety measures to bring down the incidence of such injuries in the future.
All patients (176) with high voltage electrical injuries reporting to our centre from January 2001 to December 2010 were included in the study.
The most common age group was 20-40 years, with mean age of 29.77 ± 8.98 years.
Incidence was higher among the rural population (68.75%) than in urban areas (31.25%), and in the winter months.
Electricians comprised 47.16% of victims.
The most common mode of injury was touching a live wire directly or indirectly, and was seen in 63.64% of victims.
Average total body surface burned was 15.27 ± 10.15 percent. Right upper limb was most commonly involved (64.20% of patients).
Compartment syndrome was seen in 40.34% of patients, and fasciotomies on all the affected limbs saved around half of them.
An average of 3.91 surgical procedures per patient were performed. Around one-third of the victims required major amputations. Reconstructive procedures were required in 49.43% of patients.
Average hospital stay was 26.81 days. Average mortality rate was 2.27%.
High voltage electrical injuries are not uncommon in the Kashmir Valley, and electrical workers are at higher risk.
The incidence of high voltage injuries would not be so high if the workers were properly trained, hazards of high-tension lines were explained and the use of safety equipment was made mandatory.


Abstract
A significant proportion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are referred to mental health centers due to the presence of challenging behaviors.
Because challenging behaviors in children and adolescents with ASD often result from underlying social and communication difficulties and comorbid anxiety, traditional caregiver-mediated behavior intervention techniques developed for children with disruptive behavior disorders may need to be adapted for this population.
This review summarizes the current literature with regard to caregiver-mediated behavioral interventions for children with ASD, and suggests areas for intervention development and research.


Abstract
Knowledge generation through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is critical to advance the medical evidence base, inform decision-making, and improve care and outcomes.
The establishment of formal clinical trial networks can facilitate the successful conduct of RCTs and has significantly increased the number of RCTs performed worldwide in other medical specialties.
No such formal network of nephrology trialists exists in Canada.
On April 24, 2014, the Canadian Kidney Knowledge Translation and Generation Network (CANN-NET) Clinical Trials Committee held a stakeholder engagement meeting to address this gap and improve the nephrology clinical trial landscape in Canada.
The meeting was held in Vancouver in association with the 2014 Canadian Society of Nephrology Annual General Meeting and was co-sponsored by the Kidney Foundation of Canada and CANN-NET.
Attendees included nephrologists from university- and non-university-affiliated nephrology practices, administrators, and representatives from the Kidney Foundation of Canada.
Through structured presentations and facilitated group discussions, the group explored the extent to which nephrology trials are currently happening in Canada, barriers to leading or participating in larger investigator-initiated trials, and strategies to improve clinical trial output in nephrology in Canada.
The themes and action items arising from this meeting are discussed.


Abstract
Skillmix is often proposed as a measure to address the growing needs of an aging population with its expected increase in chronic diseases.
This article reports on a symposium on interprofessional collaboration which took place in the canton of Valais in Switzerland.
Reviews of the literature on interprofessional collaboration show evidence in favor of the effectiveness of having interactions between physicians, nurses, pharmacists and physiotherapists.
A critical analysis of different forms of coordinated care within family medicine supports the effectiveness of these approaches.
However, these approaches now need to be tested in Switzerland.


Abstract
The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) is the oldest international non-governmental organisation involved in the fight against tuberculosis.
In 2008, the Institute of The Union was challenged to think boldly about the future and to develop a diverse work portfolio covering a wide spectrum of lung health and other disease-related problems.
The vision adopted by The Union at that time was 'Health solutions for the poor'.
More recently, there has been lengthy debate about the need for the Union to concentrate just on its core mandate of tuberculosis and lung health and for the Union's vision to reflect this narrower spectrum of activity as 'Lung health solutions for the poor'.
In this viewpoint article we outline our reasons for believing that this narrower vision is incompatible with The Union's mission statement, and we argue that making such a change would be a mistake.


Abstract
The aim of this article is to document the experience of the author who volunteered as a resident for 6 months at a districtlevel hospital in central Kenya.
Peculiarities emerging from the report are: specificity of the experience to plastic reconstructive surgery; highly complex reconstructive procedures performed under direct supervision of a qualified mentor; exposure to diverse approaches through collaboration with different volunteer plastic surgeons; enhancement of long-term surveillance; and opportunity to expand surgical knowledge outside one's field of specialty.
The humanitarian setting allows maximal exposure and learning and can play a significant role in the resident's education.


Abstract
Haemangioma are benign, vasoformative lesions of endothelial origin.
A minority of patients with a vertebral location are symptomatic with neck or back pain.
Neurological deficits due to spinal cord compression are rare and mostly observed at the thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
Treatment is indicated in case of relevant symptomatology.
Several invasive treatment modalities exist such as surgery and intralesional injections, but radiotherapy is the most common treatment for painful lesions.
We report a case of a patient with symptomatic bifocal vertebral haemangioma (d9, l3) associated with dorsal and lumbar pain treated simultaneously using a cyberknife® vsi system, with a significant reduction of pain and a limited toxicity.


Abstract
Undernutrition represents a wide-spread clinical state in outpatients and inpatients.
It is associated with a high morbidity and mortality, an impaired quality of life, and increased healthcare costs.
Early diagnosis and treatement help to reduce these medical and economic consequences.
Oral nutritive supplements (ONS) are simple, effective and economic medical treatments to fight against undernutrition.
However, they are insufficiently used for outpatients because of lack of knowledge.
This article reviews the impact of ONS, their indications and contraindications and their modalities of prescription and focuses especially on community-dwelling patients.


Abstract
The current report describes two renal transplant recipients who presented with sporotrichosis.
In addition, the authors review the general aspects of sporotrichosis in renal transplant recipients reported in the literature.
Sporotrichosis is a rare fungal infection in transplant patients and has been reported primarily in renal transplant recipients not treated with antifungal prophylaxis.
Extracutaneous forms of sporotrichosis without skin manifestations and no previous history of traumatic injuries have been described in such patients and are difficult to diagnose.
Renal transplant recipients with sporotrichosis described in the present report were successfully treated with antifungal therapy including amphotericin B deoxycholate, lipid amphotericin B formulations, fluconazole and itraconazole.


Abstract
Psychiatric treatment relies on a solid armamentarium of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment modalities that perform reasonably well for many patients but leave others in a state of chronic disability or troubled by problematic side effects.
Treatment planning in psychiatry remains an art that depends on considerable trial and error. Thus, there is an urgent need for better tools that will provide a means for matching individual patients with the most effective treatments while minimizing the risk of adverse events.
This review will consider the current state of the science in predicting treatment outcomes in psychiatry.
Genetic and other biomarkers will be considered alongside clinical diagnostic, and family history data.
Problems inherent in prediction medicine will also be discussed, along with recent developments that support the hope that psychiatry can do a better job in quickly identifying the best treatments for each patient.

Abstract
Education of first responders and referring medical professionals is considered vital to high-quality burn care.
Prior to 1999, the community education program at The Burn Center of MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) was staffed by ICU nurses who volunteered their time.
As the program became more popular in the mid-1990s, the requests for lectures exceeded the capacity of a volunteer program.
A request to hospital administration for a full-time education coordinator position was rejected in the climate of budget cut-backs and declining reimbursement.
A business-oriented proposal, ultimately accepted, promised an increase in admissions, an improved payor mix, and an annual review of data to demonstrate the cost/benefit advantage.
Community education programs increased almost four-fold.
Average annual admissions increased initially from 292 to 374 and have continued to increase, rising to 812 in fiscal year 2008. As expected, the average percent total body surface area burns decreased (from 10.8% to 6.9%), reflecting increased referral of smaller burns and, inferentially and per analysis, an improved payor mix.
Most impressive was the increase in charitable donations, from an annual average of $27,500 before the position was created to an average of $183,000 annually thereafter.
From this experience as well as the experience discovered by a national survey, there are desirable side effects of a full-time community burn education program coordinator, and the cost for The Burn Center at MWHC has been more than balanced by the benefits.


Abstract
Chronic Q fever is a potentially fatal disease.
The current difficulty in the diagnosis of this condition is discussed in the present article.
A 51-year-old woman with a history of aortic valve replacement presented with complaints of feeling generally unwell, pyrexia and occasional unproductive cough over a period of several weeks.
Phase 1 immunoglobulin G titre to Coxiella burnetii was initially detected at a low level (1:320, detected using immunofluorescence) and was not considered to be significant according to the modified Duke criteria.
Later in the course of her illness, the patient's antibody titre rose to a high level (1:1280).
The issues regarding current laboratory diagnosis and management of Q fever are discussed. Chronic Q fever can be associated with an inadequate serological response.
Close follow-up of cases is essential.
The recommended serological criteria for the diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis needs to be revisited.


Abstract
Elderly patients in palliative situations residing in a nursing home present characteristics and specificities that clearly distinguish them from patients with advanced cancer.
Besides the difficulty to define a precise prognosis, their many comorbidities, their communication difficulties because of cognitive disorders, their high sensitivity to primary and secondary effects of drugs render their management a real challenge for physician and caregivers.
Accompanying these patients at the end of their life also raises many ethical problems, especially when they are no longer able to express their wishes and have not previously expressed advance directives.


Abstract
Face burns expose patients to a higher respiratory risk, and early prophylactic intubation before they enter the burn unit might be life-saving.
However, unnecessary intubation may compromise their clinical evolution.
Hence, the decision to perform pre-burn centre endotracheal intubation remains a clinical challenge.
A retrospective study was developed to characterize the experience of the tertiary burn unit of the Hospital da Prelada with face burn patients arriving endotracheally-intubated between January 2009 and September 2013.
Specific goals included assessment of whether these intubations were clinically appropriate and if these procedures determined significant changes in clinical course and outcome.
A total of 136 patients were admitted to our burn centre with facial burns.
38.2% (n=52) of them arrived endotracheally-intubated, with 75% (n=39) intubated at the scene of the burn injury and 25% (n=13) in the emergency room because of the suspicion of smoke inhalation injury.
The overall mortality rate was 12.5% (n=17): 3.6% (n=3) were patients who had not been subjected to pre-burn centre intubation, and 27% (n=14) were in the group of patients arriving intubated.
A face burn is a warning sign of a possible upper airway injury, and pre-burn centre prophylactic intubation might be life-saving.
However, unnecessary intubation may impair clinical evolution.
Therefore, it is imperative that updated practice guidelines for pre-burn centre airway management are adhered to, and that these guidelines are subject to revision in order to improve airway management in burn patients.


Abstract
Infections of aortic prosthesis are quite unusual.
Initially, these infections can be treated with antibiotics, but, in case of failure, the infected prosthesis must be removed and a new aorto-iliac system has to be reconstructed surgically.
We report, the case of a woman affected by infection of an aortic prosthesis and whose problem has been solved by means of a new aorto-iliac graft by using cryogenically conserved allograft.
Epidemiology, potential complications and treatment will be discussed.


Abstract
During the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System's (NAHMS) 2007-2008 beef study, 567 producers from 24 US States were offered the opportunity to collect fecal samples from weaned beef calves and have them evaluated for the presence of parasite eggs (Phase 1).
Participating producers were provided with instructions and materials for sample collection.
Up to 20 fresh fecal samples were collected from each of the 99 participating operations.
Fresh fecal samples were submitted to one of 3 randomly assigned laboratories for evaluation.
Upon arrival at the laboratories, all samples were processed for the enumeration of strongyle, Nematodirus, and Trichuris eggs using the modified Wisconsin technique.
The presence or absence of coccidian oocysts and tapeworm eggs was also noted.
In submissions where the strongyle eggs per gram exceeded 30, aliquots from 2 to 6 animals were pooled for DNA extraction.
Extracted DNA was subjected to genus level polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification for the presence of Ostertagia, Cooperia, Haemonchus, Oesophagostomum, and Trichostrongylus.
In this study, 85.6% of the samples had strongyle type, Nematodirus, and Trichuris eggs.
Among the samples evaluated, 91% had Cooperia, 79% Ostertagia, 53% Haemonchus, 38% Oesophagostomum, 18% Nematodirus, 7% Trichuris, and 3% Trichostrongylus.
The prevalence of coccidia and tapeworm eggs was 59.9% and 13.7%, respectively.
