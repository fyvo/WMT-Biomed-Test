Abstract
Metabolic diseases were more frequent in the males grasscutters.
However, death rate in the females was twice that of the males.

Abstract
We describe ten cases of tetanus in the newborn and nineteen cases of no umbilical tetanus, treated by diazepam, as the only muscle relaxant and tranquillizer medicine.
There were seven deaths among the first ones (70%) and four among the last ones (21,1%).
The former experiment of the Service showed a mortality of 90% for the cases of umbilical tetanus and 25,2% for the others.


Abstract
Qualitative studies from developing countries have pointed to the widespread popularity of injections.
The present article examines the reasons behind the demand for injections by consumers and the administration of unnecessary or unsafe injections by different types of provider.


Abstract
The largest outbreak of poliomyelitis ever recorded in Africa (1093 cases) occurred from 1 March to 28 May 1999 in Luanda, Angola, and in surrounding areas.
The outbreak was caused primarily by a type-3 wild poliovirus, although type-1 wild poliovirus was circulating in the outbreak area at the same time.
Infected individuals ranged in age from 2 months to 22 years; 788 individuals (72%) were younger than 3 years.
Of the 590 individuals whose vaccination status was known, 23% had received no vaccine and 54% had received fewer than three doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV).
The major factors that contributed to this outbreak were as follows: massive displacement of unvaccinated persons to urban settings; low routine OPV coverage; inaccessible populations during the previous three national immunization days (NIDs); and inadequate sanitation.
This outbreak indicates the urgent need to improve accessibility to all children during NIDs and the dramatic impact that war can have by displacing persons and impeding access to routine immunizations.
The period immediately after an outbreak provides an enhanced opportunity to eradicate poliomyelitis.
If continuous access in all districts for acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and supplemental immunizations cannot be assured, the current war in Angola may threaten global poliomyelitis eradication.

Advances in analytical and experimental epidemiology have been more modest.


Abstract
In 1980, diarrhoea was the leading cause of child mortality, accounting for 4.6 million deaths annually.
Efforts to control diarrhoea over the past decade have been based on multiple, potentially powerful interventions implemented more or less simultaneously.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was introduced in 1979 and rapidly became the cornerstone of programmes for the control of diarrhoeal diseases.
Nevertheless, the data show positive trends in diarrhoea management in most parts of the world.


Abstract
Less frequent but important causes of bilateral vision loss in patients with HIV/AIDS include varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus retinitis, HIV-related ischaemic microvasculopathy, ocular syphilis, ocular tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and ocular toxic or allergic drug reactions.
At present, most patients with HIV/AIDS in developing countries who lose their vision have a very limited life expectancy.
As antiretroviral therapy makes its way to these countries, however, both life expectancy and the prevalence of blindness related to HIV/AIDS can be expected to increase dramatically.


Abstract
Genital ulcers are important cofactors of HIV transmission in the countries most severely affected by HIV/ AIDS.
Chancroid is a common cause of genital ulcer in all 18 countries where adult HIV prevalence surpasses 8% and is rare in countries with low-level HIV epidemics.
Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative organism of chancroid, is biologically vulnerable and occupies a precarious epidemiological niche.
Both simple, topical hygiene and male circumcision greatly reduce risk of infection and several classes of antibiotics - some of which can be administered in single-dose treatment regimens - provide rapid cure.
H. ducreyi depends on sexual networks with high rates of partner change for its survival, thriving in environments characterized by male mobility and intensive commercial sex activity.
Elimination of H. ducreyi infection from vulnerable groups results in disappearance of chancroid from the larger community.
Once endemic in Europe and North America, chancroid began a steady decline early in the twentieth century, well before the discovery of antibiotics.
Social changes - resulting in changing patterns of commercial sex - probably disrupted the conditions needed to sustain chancroid as an endemic disease.
Sporadic outbreaks are now easily controlled when effective curative and preventive services are made available to sex workers and their clients.
More recently, chancroid prevalence has declined markedly in countries such as the Philippines, Senegal, and Thailand, a development that may contribute to stabilization of the HIV epidemics in these countries.
Eradication of chancroid is a feasible public health objective.
Protecting sex workers and their clients from exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and improving curative services for STDs are among the proven strategies that could be employed.


Abstract
Resistance to antimicrobial therapies reduces the effectiveness of these drugs, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditure.
International collective action is therefore essential.
This paper considers the capacity of national and international institutions and mechanisms to generate a collective response to antimicrobial resistance.
Approaches are suggested for securing international collective action for the containment of antimicrobial resistance.


Abstract
The available evidence is not adequate to allow quantification of the risk.


Abstract
Over the past 10 years, molecular methods have become available with which to strain-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
They have allowed researchers to study certain important but previously unresolved issues in the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB).
For example, some unsuspected microepidemics have been revealed and it has been shown that the relative contribution of recently acquired disease to the TB burden in many settings is far greater than had been thought.
These findings have led to the strengthening of TB control.
Other research has demonstrated the existence and described the frequency of exogenous reinfection in areas of high incidence.
Much recent work has focused on the phenotypic variation among strains and has evaluated the relative transmissibility, virulence, and immunogenicity of different lineages of the organism.
We summarize the recent achievements in TB epidemiology associated with the introduction of DNA fingerprinting techniques, and consider the implications of this technology for the design and analysis of epidemiological studies.


Abstract
Over the past 10 years, tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development has resurged as an active area of investigation.
The renewed interest has been stimulated by the recognition that, although BCG is delivered to approximately 90% of all neonates globally through the Expanded Programme on Immunization, Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to cause over 8 million new cases of TB and over 2 million deaths annually.
Over one hundred TB vaccine candidates have been developed, using different approaches to inducing protective immunity.
Candidate vaccines are typically screened in small animal models of primary TB disease for their ability to protect against a virulent strain of M. tuberculosis.
The most promising are now beginning to enter human safety trials, marking real progress in this field for the first time in 80 years.


Abstract
Legislation to control tobacco use in developing countries has lagged behind the dramatic rise in tobacco consumption.
Despite these measures, the new legislation will not be enough to control the demand for tobacco products in India.
The Indian Government must also introduce policies to raise taxes, control smuggling, close advertising loopholes, and create adequate provisions for the enforcement of tobacco control laws.


Abstract
The large epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom has been in decline since 1992, but has spread to other countries.
The number of infected animals currently entering the food chain is probably small, and the controls placed on bovine tissues in the European Union and Switzerland should ensure that any risks to human health are small and diminishing.
Vigilance is required in all countries, especially in those in which there has been within-species recycling of ruminant feed.
Fewer than 150 people, globally, have been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), but there are many uncertainties about the future course of the epidemic because of the long and variable incubation period.
Better control measures are necessary to guard against the possibility of iatrogenic transmission through blood transfusion or contaminated surgical instruments.
These measures will require sensitive and specific diagnostic tests and improved decontamination methods.


Abstract
Between 1996 and 2001, 10 350 patients received post-exposure treatment; 7227 of these received the Thai Red Cross intradermal regimen.
Fewer than 3% of exposed patients received rabies immunoglobulin.
All patients were alive one year after exposure.
Two human deaths occurred in the first two years of the programme - neither patient had received vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin after exposure.
No deaths occurred during the last three years of the programme, which indicated that the programme was successful.


Abstract
Health impact assessments associated with large-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, monitor pre-existing conditions and new diseases associated with particular industries or changes in social organization.
This paper suggests that illness self-reports constitute a complementary set of benchmarks to measure the health impacts of these projects, and presents data gathered in ongoing household and health service surveys in Ngalaba, a village near a major oilfield in Chad.
In an initial 16-week period of weekly data collection, 363 people reported few of the clinically chronic or asymptomatic conditions expected according to health transition theory, and the overall level of illness reporting was low.
Illnesses often were described by symptoms or lay diagnoses.
Health care practitioners were consulted rarely; when they were, resources for diagnosis and treatment were limited.
Clinically acute, short-duration illnesses (e.g. parasitic infections, toothaches, or hernias) were experienced as chronic conditions and were reported week after week.
The low levels of illness reporting and lack of clinically chronic conditions are not taken to mean that rural Chadians are healthy.
Rather, the patterns of morbidity reflect a particular local ecology in which health services are organized and care dispensed in ways that limit the possibilities for illness in terms of types of illnesses that can be diagnosed and reported, forms illnesses take, and ways in which illnesses are experienced.
Illness self-reports are useful adjuncts to "harder" biological measures in HIAs, particularly in the context of large-scale infrastructure projects with explicit development goals.
Rather than providing data on the extent to which harm has been mitigated by corporate, state, and donor activities, self-reports show the possibilities of illness in local contexts.


Abstract
In addition, a large section of the population in cities in low-income countries has to live in informal-sector, substandard housing.
Many transportation policies fail to take enough account of their impacts on poverty and social exclusion, and they neglect the access and transportation demands of the more economically disadvantaged groups of society, who rely mostly on public transportation, walking, and cycling.


Abstract
Low back pain is a leading cause of disability.
It occurs in similar proportions in all cultures, interferes with quality of life and work performance, and is the most common reason for medical consultations.
Few cases of back pain are due to specific causes; most cases are non-specific.
Acute back pain is the most common presentation and is usually self-limiting, lasting less than three months regardless of treatment.
Chronic back pain is a more difficult problem, which often has strong psychological overlay: work dissatisfaction, boredom, and a generous compensation system contribute to it.
Among the diagnoses offered for chronic pain is fibromyalgia, an urban condition (the diagnosis is not made in rural settings) that does not differ materially from other instances of widespread chronic pain.
Although disc protrusions detected on X-ray are often blamed, they rarely are responsible for the pain, and surgery is seldom successful at alleviating it.
No single treatment is superior to others; patients prefer manipulative therapy, but studies have not demonstrated that it has any superiority over others.
A WHO Advisory Panel has defined common outcome measures to be used to judge the efficacy of treatments for studies.


Abstract
Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980, during the Thirty-third World Health Assembly.
However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent years.
Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health measures.
This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus.
The data presented supports the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that "smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation.
Far from being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite."
Its R value (the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is lower.
Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses.
In the present paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control.
The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.


Abstract
Mycobacterium ulcerans disease (Buruli ulcer) is an important health problem in several west African countries.
It is prevalent in scattered foci around the world, predominantly in riverine areas with a humid, hot climate.
We review the epidemiology, bacteriology, transmission, immunology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of infections.
The mode of transmission is unknown.
Lesions are most common on exposed parts of the body, particularly on the limbs.
Spontaneous healing may occur.
Many patients in endemic areas present late with advanced, severe lesions.
BCG vaccination yields a limited, relatively short-lived, immune protection.
Recommended treatment consists of surgical debridement, followed by skin grafting if necessary.
Many patients have functional limitations after healing.
Better understanding of disease transmission and pathogenesis is needed for improved control and prevention of Buruli ulcer.


Abstract
I weigh the arguments for and against the patenting of functional DNA sequences including genes, and find the objections to be compelling.
Is an outright ban on DNA patenting the right policy response?
Not necessarily.
Governments may wish to consider options ranging from patent law reforms to the creation of new rights.
There are alternative ways to protect DNA sequences that industry may choose if DNA patenting is restricted or banned.
Some of these alternatives may be more harmful than patents.


Abstract
This paper describes the key factors and remaining challenges for tuberculosis (TB) control programmes in complex emergencies.
A complex emergency is "a humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single agency and/or the ongoing United Nations country programme."
Some 200 million people are believed to live in countries affected by complex emergencies; almost all of these are developing countries that also bear the main burden of TB.
The effects of complex emergencies impact on TB control programmes, interfering with the goals of identifying and curing TB patients and possibly leading to the emergence of MDR-TB.
There are many detailed descriptions of aid interventions during complex emergencies; yet TB control programmes are absent from most of these reports.
If TB is neglected, it may quickly result in increased morbidity and mortality, as was demonstrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Somalia.
TB is a major disease in complex emergencies and requires an appropriate public health response.
While there is no manual to cover complex emergencies, the interagency manual for TB control in refugee and displaced populations provides valuable guidance.
These programmes contribute to the body of evidence needed to compile such a manual, and should ensure that the experiences of TB control in complex emergencies lead to the establishment of evidence-based programmes.


Abstract
Part of the solution to the growing problem of child injury is to strengthen the care that injured children receive.
This paper will point out the potential health gains to be made by doing this and will then review recent advances in the care of injured children in individual institutions and countries.
It will discuss how these individual efforts have been aided by increased international attention to trauma care.
Although there are no major, well-funded global programmes to improve trauma care, recent guidance documents developed by WHO and a broad network of collaborators have stimulated increased global attention to improving planning and resources for trauma care.
This has in turn led to increased attention to strengthening trauma care capabilities in countries, including needs assessments and implementation of WHO recommendations in national policy.
Most of these global efforts, however, have not yet specifically addressed children.
Given the special needs of the injured child and the high burden of injury-related death and disability among children, clearly greater emphasis on childhood trauma care is needed.
Trauma care needs assessments being conducted in a growing number of countries need to focus more on capabilities for care of injured children.
Trauma care policy development needs to better encompass childhood trauma care.
More broadly, the growing network of individuals and groups collaborating to strengthen trauma care globally needs to engage a broader range of stakeholders who will focus on and champion the improvement of care for injured children.


Abstract
Urgent attention is required to tackle the problem of child and adolescent injury across the world.
The issue of injuries is too often absent from child and adolescent health agendas.
In December 2008, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund published the World report on child injury prevention, calling global attention to the problem of child injuries.
This article expands on the report's arguments that child injuries must be integrated into child health initiatives and proposes initial steps for achieving this integration.


Abstract
This paper represents a personal reflection on what is needed worldwide to prevent child injuries.
It repeats messages that have been frequently delivered in the past.
The main points are: first, the need for everyone to accept the view that, ultimately, injuries are a health problem and health departments must view them as such.
Second, although increased and improved research is undoubtedly important, it is futile and frustrating if the results of existing research are not acted upon.
Third, governments must play a central role by creating a national focus for the coordination and implementation of programmes whose value has been established.
These points require widespread support if we hope to make genuine progress towards the goals reflected in this issue of the Bulletin.


Abstract
This paper examines the evidence base for the use of pre-employment/pre-placement medical examinations.
The use of pre-employment examinations is often driven more by cultural practices than evidence.
There is a lack of evidence on their effectiveness in preventing health-related occupational risks.
Hypertension screening is highlighted as a common pre-employment practice for which there is no standardized criteria to use to determine fitness for work.
There are inherent problems in screening for psychiatric disorders and substance abuse as well as potential for racial bias and other unintended negative effects.
This paper questions the economic case for this practice and also expresses concerns about paternalism related to identified risk factors.
Health assessments should only be included when appropriate to the task environment and the general use of pre-employment exams and drug screening should be eliminated.
Generally, a health assessment by questionnaire should suffice.
Occupational health providers should advise against the application of physical or mental standards that are not relevant to fulfilment of the essential job functions.
Consensus development regarding best practice, as well as consideration for acquiring outcome data related to pre-employment practice, is recommended.


Abstract
Local experts, primarily national immunization system managers and WHO/UNICEF regional and national staff, are consulted for additional information on the performance of specific immunization systems.
Estimates are derived through a country-by-country review of available data informed and constrained by a set of heuristics; no statistical or mathematical models are used.
Draft estimates are made, sent to national authorities for review and comment and modified in light of their feedback.


Abstract
In 2003, the Mexican Congress approved a reform establishing the Sistema de Protección Social en Salud [System of Social Protection in Health], whereby public funding for health is being increased by one percent of the 2003 gross domestic product over seven years to guarantee universal health insurance.
Poor families that had been excluded from traditional social security can now enrol in a new public insurance scheme known as Seguro Popular [People's Insurance], which assures legislated access to a comprehensive set of health-care entitlements.
This paper describes the financial innovations behind the expansion of health-care coverage in Mexico to everyone and their effects.
Evidence shows improvements in mobilization of additional public resources; availability of health infrastructure and drugs; service utilization; effective coverage; and financial protection.
Future challenges are discussed, among them the need for additional public funding to extend access to costly interventions for non-communicable diseases not yet covered by the new insurance scheme, and to improve the technical quality of care and the responsiveness of the health system.
Eventually, the progress achieved so far will have to be reflected in health outcomes, which will continue to be evaluated so that Mexico can meet the ultimate criterion of reform success: better health through equity, quality and fair financing.


Abstract
Options for health financing reform are often portrayed as a choice between general taxation (known as the Beveridge model) and social health insurance (known as the Bismarck model).
Ten years of health financing reform in Kyrgyzstan, since the introduction of its compulsory health insurance fund in 1997, provide an excellent example of why it is wrong to reduce health financing policy to a choice between the Beveridge and Bismarck models.
Rather than fragment the system according to the insurance status of the population, as many other low- and middle-income countries have done, the Kyrgyz reforms were guided by the objective of having a single system for the entire population.
Key features include the role and gradual development of the compulsory health insurance fund as the single purchaser of health-care services for the entire population using output-based payment methods, the complete restructuring of pooling arrangements from the former decentralized budgetary structure to a single national pool, and the establishment of an explicit benefit package.
Central to the process was the transformation of the role of general budget revenues - the main source of public funding for health - from directly subsidizing the supply of services to subsidizing the purchase of services on behalf of the entire population by redirecting them into the health insurance fund.
Through their approach to health financing policy, and pooling in particular, the Kyrgyz health reformers demonstrated that different sources of funds can be used in an explicitly complementary manner to enable the creation of a unified, universal system


Abstract
Risk communication guidelines widely used in public health are based on the psychometric paradigm of risk, which focuses on risk perception at the level of individuals.
However, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies are more than public health events and occur in a highly charged political, social and economic environment.
This study examines other sociological and cultural approaches from scholars such as Ulrich Beck and Mary Douglas for insights on how to communicate in such environments.
It recommends developing supplemental tools for outbreak communication to deal with issues such as questions of blame and fairness in risk distribution and audiences who do not accept biomedical explanations of disease.


Abstract
This paper proposes an explanation concerning why some global health issues such as HIV/AIDS attract significant attention from international and national leaders, while other issues that also represent a high mortality and morbidity burden, such as pneumonia and malnutrition, remain neglected.
This explanation emphasizes the power of ideas and challenges interpretations of issue ascendance and decline that place primary emphasis on material, objective factors such as mortality and morbidity levels and the existence of cost-effective interventions.
This explanation has implications for our understanding of strategic public health communication.
If ideas in the form of issue portrayals are central, strategic communication is far from a secondary public health activity: it is at the heart of what global health policy communities do.


Abstract
Effective management of public health emergencies demands open and transparent public communication.
The rationale for transparency has public health, strategic and ethical dimensions.
Despite this, government authorities often fail to demonstrate transparency.
A key step in bridging the gap between the rhetoric and reality is to define and codify transparency to put in place practical mechanisms to encourage open public health communication for emergencies.
The authors demonstrate this approach using the example of the development and implementation process of a public health emergency information policy.


Abstract
Since 1988, the world has come very close to eradicating polio through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, in which communication interventions have played a consistently central role.
Mass media and information dissemination approaches used in immunization efforts worldwide have contributed to this success.
However, reaching the hardest-to-reach, the poorest, the most marginalized and those without access to health services has been challenging.
This review examines polio communication efforts in India and Pakistan between the years 2000 and 2007.


Abstract
In 2005, the WHO Western Pacific Region adopted the hepatitis B control goal of reducing the hepatitis B surface antigen seroprevalence in children at least 5 years of age to less than 2% by 2012.
Universal infant immunization with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, including a timely birth dose, is the key recommended strategy.


Abstract
There has been growing debate about the dual-use nature of life science research with implications for making biological weapons.
This paper reviews several controversial publications that have been the focus of debates about dual-use life science research and critically examines relevant policy developments, particularly in the United States of America.
Though the dual-use dilemma is inherently ethical in nature, the majority of debates about dual-use research have primarily involved science and security experts rather than ethicists.
It is important that there is more ethical input into debates about the governance of dual-use research.


Abstract
Public health interventions usually operate at the level of groups rather than individuals, and cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are one means of evaluating their effectiveness.
Using examples from six such trials in Bangladesh, India, Malawi and Nepal, we discuss our experience of the ethical issues that arise in their conduct.
We set cluster RCTs in the broader context of public health research, highlighting debates about the need to reconcile individual autonomy with the common good and about the ethics of public health research in low-income settings in general.
After a brief introduction to cluster RCTs, we discuss particular challenges we have faced.
These include the nature of - and responsibility for - group consent, and the need for consent by individuals within groups to intervention and data collection.
We discuss the timing of consent in relation to the implementation of public health strategies, and the problem of securing ethical review and approval in a complex domain.
Finally, we consider the debate about benefits to control groups and the standard of care that they should receive, and the issue of post-trial adoption of the intervention under test.


Abstract
In 2004, WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) released a joint statement recommending a new lower osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) formulation and zinc supplementation for diarrhoea management.
More than 5 years later, diarrhoea remains the second leading cause of death and few children in developing countries are receiving these life-saving interventions.
For nearly all countries, zinc supplements for children are not available locally; thus, zinc procurement continues to be a major obstacle.
Global resources have not been sufficient to bring diarrhoea management to the forefront; thus, the introduction of these new recommendations has remained slow.


Abstract
Globalization of intellectual property (IP) protection for medicines has been advancing during the past decade.
Countries are obliged to adapt their legislation as a requirement of their membership to the World Trade Organization or as a condition of being part of international trade agreements.
There is a growing recognition that, in low-income countries, stronger IP protection is a barrier to access to medicines.
At the same time, the number of low-income countries writing national legislation to protect IP for pharmaceutical products is growing worldwide, but little research has been done on the ways in which this process is happening at the national level.
This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of the implementation of IP legislation at the national level by providing a comparative analysis of the countries that are part of the United States-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA).
The analysis shows three trends.
First, countries have often implemented stronger IP protection than required by trade agreements.
Second, some countries have adopted IP protection before signing the trade agreements.
Third, the process of ratification of DR-CAFTA increased public debate around these issues, which in some cases led to IP legislation that considers public health needs.
These trends suggest that industrialized countries and the pharmaceutical industry are using more tactics than just trade agreements to push for increased IP protection and that the process of national legislation is a valid arena for confronting public health needs to those of the industry.


Abstract
In addition, preventing unintended pregnancies in women with HIV is an essential component of a comprehensive prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme.
As a result, a call for stronger linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV policies, programmes and services has been issued by several international organizations.
However, we now have a new opportunity to address these essential linkages.
By tapping into these platforms for advocating and by continuing to invest in research to identify integrated service delivery best practices, we have an opportunity to strengthen ties between the two synergistic fields.


Abstract
The Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) held in Cairo in 1994 offers a comprehensive framework for achieving sexual and reproductive health and rights, including the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, and for advancing other development goals.
The United Nations Millennium Development Goals now incorporate a target of universal access to sexual and reproductive health within the goal of improving maternal health, but combating HIV remains a separate project with malaria and tuberculosis.
All investments in research, policies and programmes should build systematically on the natural synergies inherent in the ICPD model to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency and to strengthen the capacity of health systems to deliver universally accessible sexual and reproductive health information and services.


Abstract
A lack of common understanding of terminology and clear technical operational guidance, and separate policy, institutional and financing processes continue to represent significant constraints.
We draw on experience with tuberculosis and HIV integration to highlight some lessons.
The paper concludes that there is little evidence to determine whether funding for health systems is strengthening linkages and we make several recommendations to maximize opportunities represented by recent developments.


Abstract
The links between rapid population growth and concerns regarding climate change have received little attention.
Some commentators have argued that slowing population growth is necessary to reduce further rises in carbon emissions.
Others have objected that this would give rise to dehumanizing "population control" programmes in developing countries.
Yet the perspective of the developing countries that will be worst affected by climate change has been almost completely ignored by the scientific literature.
This deficit is addressed by this paper, which analyses the first 40 National Adaptation Programmes of Action reports submitted by governments of least-developed countries to the Global Environment Facility for funding.
Of these documents, 93% identified at least one of three ways in which demographic trends interact with the effects of climate change: (i) faster degradation of the sources of natural resources; (ii) increased demand for scarce resources; and (iii) heightened human vulnerability to extreme weather events.
These findings suggest that voluntary access to family planning services should be made more available to poor communities in least-developed countries.
We stress the distinction between this approach, which prioritizes the welfare of poor communities affected by climate change, and the argument that population growth should be slowed to limit increases in global carbon emissions.
The paper concludes by calling for increased support for rights-based family planning services, including those integrated with HIV/AIDS services, as an important complementary measure to climate change adaptation programmes in developing countries.


Abstract
Control of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is feasible, leads to improved sexual and reproductive health and contributes to preventing HIV transmission.
The most advanced HIV epidemics have developed under conditions of poor STI control, particularly where ulcerative STIs were prevalent.
Several countries that have successfully controlled STIs have documented stabilization or reversal of their HIV epidemics.
STI control is a public health outcome measured by reduced incidence and prevalence.
The means to achieve this include: (i) targeting and outreach to populations at greatest risk; (ii) promoting and providing condoms and other means of prevention; (iii) effective clinical interventions; (iv) an enabling environment; and (v) reliable data.
Clinical services include STI case management, screening and management of STIs in sex partners.
Syndromic case management is effective for most symptomatic curable STIs and screening strategies exist to detect some asymptomatic infections.
Presumptive epidemiologic treatment of sex partners and sex workers complement efforts to interrupt transmission and reduce prevalence.
Clinical services alone are insufficient for control since many people with STIs do not attend clinics.
Outreach and peer education have been effectively used to reach such populations.
STI control requires effective interventions with core populations whose rates of partner change are high enough to sustain transmission.
Effective, appropriate targeting is thus necessary and often sufficient to reduce prevalence in the general population.
Such efforts are most effective when combined with structural interventions to ensure an enabling environment for prevention.
Reliable surveillance and related data are critical for designing and evaluating interventions and for assessing control efforts.


Abstract
Accurate mortality statistics, needed for population health assessment, health policy and research, are best derived from data in vital registration systems.
However, mortality statistics from vital registration systems are not available for several countries including Viet Nam.
We used a mixed methods case study approach to assess vital registration operations in 2006 in three provinces in Viet Nam (Hòa Bình, Thùa Thiên-Hué and Bình Duong), and provide recommendations to strengthen vital registration systems in the country.
For each province we developed life tables from population and mortality data compiled by sex and age group.
Demographic methods were used to estimate completeness of death registration as an indicator of vital registration performance.
Qualitative methods (document review, key informant interviews and focus group discussions) were used to assess administrative, technical and societal aspects of vital registration systems.
Completeness of death registration was low in all three provinces.
Problems were identified with the legal framework for registration of early neonatal deaths and deaths of temporary residents or migrants.
The system does not conform to international standards for reporting cause of death or for recording detailed statistics by age, sex and cause of death.
Capacity-building along with an intersectoral coordination committee involving the Ministries of Justice and Health and the General Statistics Office would improve the vital registration system, especially with regard to procedures for death registration.
There appears to be strong political support for sentinel surveillance systems to generate reliable mortality statistics in Viet Nam.


Abstract
Since its widespread introduction, the hepatitis B vaccine has become an essential part of infant immunization programmes globally.
The vaccine has been particularly important for countries where the incidence of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma is high.
This paper examines the mechanism of antiviral drug-selected changes in the portion of the viral genome that also affects the surface antigen, and explores their potential impact on current hepatitis B immunization programmes.


Abstract
The first target of the fifth United Nations Millennium Development Goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 75% between 1990 and 2015.
This target is critically off track.
Despite difficulties inherent in measuring maternal mortality, interventions aimed at reducing it must be monitored and evaluated to determine the most effective strategies in different contexts.


Abstract
This article looks at the current burden of communicable diseases in the South-East Asia Region of the World Health Organization and analyses whether the current levels and trends in funding are adequate to meet the needs of control, prevention and treatment.
Our analysis considers the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health and indicators of economic progress in each country, as well as the impact of the global financial crisis on progress towards MDGs for communicable diseases in the region.
The analysis indicates that the current focus of funding may need to be expanded to include less-discussed but high-burden diseases often related to inadequacies in the health sector and the particular development paths that countries pursue.
Scarce funding during times of global economic recession could be used more effectively if informed by a careful analysis of the complex set of factors, including behavioural, environmental and health systems factors, that determine the burden of communicable diseases.
Significant gaps in funding as well as varying regional needs warrant a more diverse set of national and international aid measures.
Although regional and global collaboration is critical, the effectiveness of future policies to deal with the burden of communicable diseases in the region will only be assured if these policies are based on evidence and developed by policy-makers familiar with each country's needs and priorities.

The neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which affect the very poor, pose a major public health problem in the South-East Asia Region of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Although more than a dozen NTDs affect the region, over the past five years four of them in particular - leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) and yaws - have been targeted for elimination.
These four were selected for a number of reasons.
First, they affect the WHO South-East Asia Region disproportionately.
For example, every year around 67% of all new leprosy cases and 60% of all new cases of visceral leishmaniasis worldwide occur in countries of the region, where as many as 850 million inhabitants are at risk of contracting lymphatic filariasis.
In addition, several epidemiological, technological and historical factors that are unique to the region make each of these four diseases amenable to elimination.
Safe and effective tools and interventions to achieve these targets are available and concerted efforts to scale them up, singly or in an integrated manner, are likely to lead to success.
The World Health Assembly and the WHO Regional Committee, through a series of resolutions, have already expressed regional and global commitments for the elimination of these diseases as public health problems.
Such action is expected to have a quick and dramatic impact on poverty reduction and to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
This paper reviews the policy rationale for disease control in the WHO South-East Asia Region, the progress made so far, the lessons learnt along the way, and the remaining challenges and opportunities.


Abstract
Many countries have developed strategies to attract and retain qualified health workers in underserved areas, but there is only scarce and weak evidence on their successes or failures.
It is difficult to compare lessons and measure results from the few evaluations that are available.
Evaluation faces several challenges, including the heterogeneity of the terminology, the complexity of the interventions, the difficulty of assessing the influence of contextual factors, the lack of baseline information, and the need for multimethod and multi-disciplinary approaches for monitoring and evaluation.
Moreover, the social, political and economic context in which interventions are designed and implemented is rarely considered in monitoring and evaluating interventions for human resources for health.
This paper proposes a conceptual framework that offers a model for monitoring and evaluation of retention interventions taking into account such challenges.
The conceptual framework is based on a systems approach and aims to guide the thinking in evaluating an intervention to increase access to health workers in underserved areas, from its design phase through to its results.
It also aims to guide the monitoring of interventions through the routine collection of a set of indicators, applicable to the specific context.
It suggests that a comprehensive approach needs to be used for the design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review of the interventions.
The framework is not intended to be prescriptive and can be applied flexibly to each country context.
It promotes the use of a common understanding on how attraction and retention interventions work, using a systems perspective.


Abstract
Compulsory service programmes have been used worldwide as a way to deploy and retain a professional health workforce within countries.
This study identified three different types of compulsory service programmes in 70 countries.
Depending on the country, doctors, nurses, midwives and all types of professional allied health workers are required to participate in the programme.
Some of the compliance-enforcement measures include withholding full registration until obligations are completed, withholding degree and salary, or imposing large fines.
This paper aims to explain these programmes more clearly, to identify countries that have or had such programmes, to develop a typology for the different kinds and to discuss the programmes in the light of important issues that are related to policy concepts and implementation.
As governments consider the cost of investment in health professionals' education, the loss of health professionals to emigration and the lack of health workers in many geographic areas, they are using compulsory service requirements as a way to deploy and retain the health workforce.


Abstract
Developing countries currently face internal and external migration of their health workforce and interventions are needed to attract and retain health professionals in rural areas.
Evidence of multidimensional interventions, however, is scarce.
This study explores a long-standing strategy to attract and retain doctors to rural areas in Chile: the Rural Practitioner Programme.
The main objective is to describe the programme, characterize its multidimensional set of incentives and appraise preliminary programme outcomes.
The programme has successfully recruited a large number of applicants, with acceptance rates close to 100%.
Retention rates are nearly 100% (drop-outs are exceptional), but only 58% of participants stay for the maximum period.
Areas with greater work difficulty are attracting the best-ranked applicants, but incentives to engage in community projects, management responsibilities, continuous medical education and research have achieved mixed results.
Rural doctors are satisfied with their experience and 70% plan to practise as specialists in a referral hospital.
The programme has successfully matched the interests of physicians in specialization with the country's need for rural doctors.
However, a gap might be forming between the demand for certain specialties and what the programme can offer.


Abstract
The lack of health workers in remote and rural areas is a worldwide concern.
Many countries have proposed and implemented interventions to address this issue, but very little is known about the effectiveness of such interventions and their sustainability in the long run.
This paper provides an analysis of the effectiveness of interventions to attract and retain health workers in remote and rural areas from an impact evaluation perspective.
It reports on a literature review of studies that have conducted evaluations of such interventions.
It presents a synthesis of the indicators and methods used to measure the effects of rural retention interventions against several policy dimensions such as: attractiveness of rural or remote areas, deployment/recruitment, retention, and health workforce and health systems performance.
It also discusses the quality of the current evidence on evaluation studies and emphasizes the need for more thorough evaluations to support policy-makers in developing, implementing and evaluating effective interventions to increase availability of health workers in underserved areas and ultimately contribute to reaching the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals.


Abstract
China is experiencing a syphilis epidemic of enormous proportions.
The regions most heavily affected by syphilis correspond to regions where sexually transmitted HIV infection is also a major public health threat.
Many high-risk patients in China fail to receive routine syphilis screening.
This missed public health opportunity stems from both a failure of many high-risk individuals to seek clinical care and a disconnect between policy and practice.
New point-of-care syphilis testing enables screening in non-traditional settings such as community organizations or sex venues.


Abstract
Epidemiologists and public health researchers are moving very slowly in the data sharing revolution, and agencies that maintain global health databases are reluctant to share data too.
Once investments in infrastructure have been made, recycling and combining data provide access to maximum knowledge for minimal additional cost.
By refusing to share data, researchers are slowing progress towards reducing illness and death and are denying a public good to taxpayers who support most of the research.
Funders of public health research are beginning to call for change and developing data sharing policies.
However they are not yet adequately addressing the obstacles that underpin the failure to share data.
These include professional structures that reward publication of analysis but not of data, and funding streams and career paths that continue to undervalue critical data management work.
Practical issues need to be sorted out too: how and where should data be stored for the long term, who will control access, and who will pay for those services?
Existing metadata standards need to be extended to cope with health data.
These obstacles have been known for some time; most can be overcome in the field of public health just as they have been overcome in other fields.
However no institution has taken the lead in defining a work plan and carving up the tasks and the bill.
In this round table paper, we suggest goals for data sharing and a work plan for reaching them, and challenge respondents to move beyond well intentioned but largely aspirational data sharing plans.


Abstract
This paper describes the development of a tool that uses human rights concepts and methods to improve relevant laws, regulations and policies related to sexual and reproductive health.
This tool aims to improve awareness and understanding of States' human rights obligations.
It includes a method for systematically examining the status of vulnerable groups, involving non-health sectors, fostering a genuine process of civil society participation and developing recommendations to address regulatory and policy barriers to sexual and reproductive health with a clear assignment of responsibility.
Strong leadership from the ministry of health, with support from the World Health Organization or other international partners, and the serious engagement of all involved in this process can strengthen the links between human rights and sexual and reproductive health, and contribute to national achievement of the highest attainable standard of health.


Abstract
The metric of "bed numbers" is commonly used in hospital planning, but it fails to capture key aspects of how hospital services are delivered.
Drawing on a study of innovative hospital projects in Europe, we argue that hospital capacity planning should not be based on beds, but rather on the ability to deliver processes.
We propose using approaches that are based on manufacturing theory such as "lean thinking" that focuses on the value that different processes add for the primary customer, i.e. the patient.
We argue that it is beneficial to look at the hospital, not from the perspective of beds or specialties, but rather from the path taken by the patients who are treated in them, the respective processes delivered by health professionals and the facilities appropriate to those processes.
Systematized care pathways seem to offer one avenue for achieving these goals.
However, they need to be underpinned by a better understanding of the flows of patients, work and goods within a hospital, the bottlenecks that occur, and translation of this understanding into new capacity planning tools.


Abstract
Opt-out testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incorporates testing as a routine part of health care for all patients unless they refuse.
The ethics of this approach to testing in sub-Saharan Africa is a source of controversy.
At the population level, these benefits will likely outweigh the potential negative consequences of individuals experiencing HIV-related stigma.
These justifications appeal to consequentialist moral theories that the acceptability of an action depends upon its outcomes.
On the other hand, liberal moral theories state that the autonomy of individuals should always be protected unless restricting autonomy is necessary to protect the welfare of others.
Opt-out consent may restrict autonomy and it is unclear whether it would benefit people other than those being tested.
Yet, the doctrine of libertarian paternalism proposes that it is justifiable and desirable to use unobtrusive mechanisms to help individuals make choices to maximize their own welfare.
Central to this idea are the premises featured by supporters of opt-out consent that individuals will not always make the best choices for their own welfare but they may be influenced to do so in ways that will not compromise their freedom of choice.
Also important is the premise that all policies inevitably exert some such influence: opt-in consent encourages test refusal just as opt-out consent encourages acceptance.
Based on these premises, opt-out testing may be an effective and ethically acceptable policy response to Africa's HIV epidemic.


Abstract
Access to well trained and motivated health workers is the major rural health issue.
Without local access, it is unlikely that people in rural and remote communities will be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Studies in many countries have shown that the three factors most strongly associated with entering rural practice are: (i) a rural background; (ii) positive clinical and educational experiences in rural settings as part of undergraduate medical education; and (iii) targeted training for rural practice at the postgraduate level.
This paper presents evidence for policy initiatives involving the training of medical students from, in and for rural and remote areas.
We give examples of medical schools in different regions of the world that are using an evidence-based and context-driven educational approach to producing skilled and motivated health workers.
We demonstrate how context influences the design and implementation of different rural education programmes.
Successful programmes have overcome major obstacles including negative assumptions and attitudes, and limitations of human, physical, educational and financial resources.
Training rural health workers in the rural setting is likely to result in greatly improved recruitment and retention of skilled health-care providers in rural underserved areas with consequent improvement in access to health care for the local communities.


Title
Lessons from New Zealand's introduction of pictorial health warnings on tobacco packaging.

Abstract
While international evidence suggests that featuring pictorial health warnings on tobacco packaging is an effective tobacco control intervention, the process used to introduce these new warnings has not been well documented.
We examined relevant documents and interviewed officials responsible for this process in New Zealand.


Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) services in China are provided through a large network of TB dispensaries.
Even though hospitals are not as well placed to follow recommended standards of TB care, a significant proportion of people with TB symptoms seek care from hospitals.
In spite of having a policy and mandate in place, the Ministry of Health had little success in encouraging hospitals to refer suspected TB cases to dispensaries.
Following the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, the government set up a nationwide Internet-based communicable diseases reporting system.
This achieved productive collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries.
Using the Internet-based reporting system, hospitals in China contributed to finding about one third of all sputu m smear-positive TB cases and helped meet the global TB control target of detecting 70% of such cases.
Based on the data available from routine surveillance facilitated by this Internet-based system, this paper details the process and outcomes of strengthening collaboration between hospitals and TB dispensaries using the Internet as a tool and its potential application to other country settings.


Abstract
Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing health transition as increased globalization and accompanying urbanization are causing a double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases.
Rates of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa are the highest in the world.
The impact of noncommunicable diseases is also increasing.
For example, age-standardized mortality from cardiovascular disease may be up to three times higher in some African than in some European countries.
As the entry point into the health service for most people, primary care plays a key role in delivering communicable disease prevention and care interventions.
This role could be extended to focus on noncommunicable diseases as well, within the context of efforts to strengthen health systems by improving primary-care delivery.
Implementing these proposals requires action by national and international alliances in mobilizing the necessary investments for improved health of people in developing countries in Africa undergoing health transition.


Abstract
The World Health Organization released revised principles and recommendations for HIV and infant feeding in November 2009.
The recommendations are based on programmatic evidence and research studies that have accumulated over the past few years within African countries.
This document urges national or subnational health authorities to decide whether health services should mainly counsel and support HIV-infected mothers to breastfeed and receive antiretroviral interventions, or to avoid all breastfeeding, based on estimations of which strategy is likely to give infants in those communities the greatest chance of HIV-free survival.
South Africa has recently revised its clinical guidelines for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, adopting many of the recommendations in the November 2009 World Health Organization's rapid advice on use of antiretroviral drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants.
This paper presents the latest evidence regarding mortality and morbidity associated with feeding practices in the context of HIV and suggests a modification of current policy to prioritize child survival for all South African children.


Abstract
In a globalizing world, public health is no longer confined to national borders.
In recent years we have observed an increasing movement of patients across international borders.
The full extent of this trend is yet unknown, as data are sparse and anecdotal.
If this trend continues, experts are convinced that it will have major implications for public health systems around the globe.
Despite the growing importance of medical travel, we still have little empirical evidence on its impact on public health, especially on health systems.
This paper summarizes the most recent debates on this topic.
It discusses the main forces that drive medical travel and its implications on health systems, in particular the impacts on access to health care, financing and the health workforce.
This paper also offers guidance on how to define medical travel and how to improve data collection.
It advocates for more scientific research that will enable countries to harness benefits and limit the potential risks to public health arising from medical travel.


Abstract
Performance-based financing is generating a heated debate.
Some suggest that it may be a donor fad with limited potential to improve service delivery.
Most of its critics view it solely as a provider payment mechanism.
Our experience is that performance-based financing can catalyse comprehensive reforms and help address structural problems of public health services, such as low responsiveness, inefficiency and inequity.
The emergence of a performance-based financing movement in Africa suggests that it may contribute to profoundly transforming the public sectors of low-income countries.


Abstract
Delivery of vaccine antigens to the dermis and/or epidermis of human skin (i.e. intradermal delivery) might be more efficient than injection into the muscle or subcutaneous tissue, thereby reducing the volumes of antigen.
This is known as dose-sparing and has been demonstrated in clinical trials with some, but not all, vaccines.
Modelling of the costs and potential savings resulting from intradermal delivery should be done to provide realistic expectations of the potential benefits and to support cases for investment.
Implementation and uptake of intradermal vaccine delivery requires further research and development, which depends upon collaboration between multiple stakeholders in the field of vaccination.


Abstract
External financial support from developed countries is a major resource for any developing country's national AIDS programme.
The influence of donors on the content and implementation of these programmes is thus inevitable.
China is a large developing country that has received considerable international support for its HIV/AIDS programme.
In the early stage of the response, each large HIV/AIDS project independently implemented their activities according to their project framework.
When internationally funded projects were few and the quantity of domestic support was minimal, their independent implementation did not pose a problem.
When many HIV/AIDS projects were simultaneously implemented in the same locations, problems emerged such as inconsistency and overlap in data collection.
China has thus coordinated and integrated all large international and domestic HIV/AIDS projects into one national programme.
The process of integration began slowly and initially consisted of unified data collection.
Integration is now complete and encompasses the processes of project planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
The process was facilitated by having a single coordinating body, cooperation from international agencies and financial commitment from the government.
Some problems were encountered during this process, such as initial reluctance from health-care staff to allocate additional time to coordinate projects.
This paper describes that process of integrating domestic and foreign HIV/AIDS projects and may serve as a useful example for other developing countries for management of scarce resources.


Abstract
In the April 2010 issue of this journal, Date et al. expressed concern over the slow scale-up in low-income settings of two therapies for the prevention of opportunistic infections in people living with the human immunodeficiency virus: co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and isoniazid preventive therapy.
This short paper discusses the important ways in which policy analysis can be of use in understanding and explaining how and why certain evidence makes its way into policy and practice and what local factors influence this process.
Key lessons about policy development are drawn from the research evidence on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis, as such lessons may prove helpful to those who seek to influence the development of national policy on isoniazid preventive therapy and other treatments.
Researchers are encouraged to disseminate their findings in a manner that is clear, but they must also pay attention to how structural, institutional and political factors shape policy development and implementation.
Doing so will help them to understand and address the concerns raised by Date et al. and other experts.
Mainstreaming policy analysis approaches that explain how local factors shape the uptake of research evidence can provide an additional tool for researchers who feel frustrated because their research findings have not made their way into policy and practice.


Abstract
Most programmes were administered by state or national governments except in Finland and Sweden where they are coordinated by pharmaceutical manufacturers.Although funding is usually from Treasury,Taiwan (China) and the United States of America impose a tax on vaccine doses distributed.
We believe there is a strong argument for widespread implementation of these programmes in other developed countries.


Title
The elusive definition of pandemic influenza.

Abstract
There has been considerable controversy over the past year, particularly in Europe, over whether the World Health Organization (WHO) changed its definition of pandemic influenza in 2009, after novel H1N1 influenza was identified.
Some have argued that not only was the definition changed, but that it was done to pave the way for declaring a pandemic.
Others claim that the definition was never changed and that this allegation is completely unfounded.
Such polarized views have hampered our ability to draw important conclusions.
This impasse, combined with concerns over potential conflicts of interest and doubts about the proportionality of the response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak, has undermined the public trust in health officials and our collective capacity to effectively respond to future disease threats.
The fact that despite ten years of pandemic preparedness activities no formal definition of pandemic influenza has been formulated reveals important underlying assumptions about the nature of this infectious disease.
In particular, the limitations of "virus-centric" approaches merit further attention and should inform ongoing efforts to "learn lessons" that will guide the response to future outbreaks of novel infectious diseases.


Abstract
This paper considers how operational research and management science can improve the design of health systems and the delivery of health care, particularly in low-resource settings.
It identifies some gaps in the way operational research is typically used in global health and proposes steps to bridge them.
The paper concludes by considering factors that will increase and improve the contribution of operational research and management science to global health.


Abstract
Women prisoners constitute a minority within all prison systems and their special health needs are frequently neglected.
The urgent need to review current services is clear from research, expert opinion and experience from countries worldwide.
Current provision of health care to imprisoned women fails to meet their needs and is, in too many cases, far short of what is required by human rights and international recommendations.
The evidence includes a lack of gender sensitivity in policies and practices in prisons, violations of women's human rights and failure to accept that imprisoned women have more and different health-care needs compared with male prisoners, often related to reproductive health issues, mental health problems, drug dependencies and histories of violence and abuse.
Additional needs stem from their frequent status as a mother and usually the primary carer for her children.
National governments, policy-makers and prison management need to address gender insensitivity and social injustice in prisons.
There are immediate steps which could be taken to deal with public health neglect, abuses of human rights and failures in gender sensitivity.


Abstract
Recent experience in evaluating large-scale global health programmes has highlighted the need to consider contextual differences between sites implementing the same intervention.
Traditional randomized controlled trials are ill-suited for this purpose, as they are designed to identify whether an intervention works, not how, when and why it works.
In this paper we review several evaluation designs that attempt to account for contextual factors that contribute to intervention effectiveness.
Using these designs as a base, we propose a set of principles that may help to capture information on context.
Finally, we propose a tool, called a driver diagram, traditionally used in implementation that would allow evaluators to systematically monitor changing dynamics in project implementation and identify contextual variation across sites.
We describe an implementation-related example from South Africa to underline the strengths of the tool.
If used across multiple sites and multiple projects, the resulting driver diagrams could be pooled together to form a generalized theory for how, when and why a widely-used intervention works.
Mechanisms similar to the driver diagram are urgently needed to complement existing evaluations of large-scale implementation efforts.


Abstract
Coordinated global efforts to prevent and control malaria have been a tour-de-force for public health, but success appears to have reached a plateau in many parts of the world.
While this is a multifaceted problem, policy strategies have largely ignored genetic variations in humans as a factor that influences both selection and dosing of antimalarial drugs.
This includes attempts to decrease toxicity, increase effectiveness and reduce the development of drug resistance, thereby lowering health care costs.
We review the potential hurdles to developing and implementing pharmacogenetic-guided policies at a national or regional scale for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.
We also consider current knowledge on some component drugs of artemisinin combination therapies and ways to increase our understanding of host genetics, with the goal of guiding policy decisions for drug selection.


Abstract
In many populations, HIV infection has become endemic.
Demand for treatment is increasing while funding is becoming more scarce and activism is waning.
Across all these areas is a strong emphasis on local capacity building, leadership, programme priorities and budgets.


Abstract
Research is needed to help identify interventions that will improve the capacity or functioning of health systems and thereby contribute to achieving global health goals.
Well conducted, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), insofar as they reduce bias and confounding, provide the strongest evidence for identifying which interventions delivered directly to individuals are safe and effective.
When ethically feasible, they can also help reduce bias and confounding when assessing interventions targeting entire health systems.
However, additional challenges emerge when research focuses on interventions that target the multiple units of organization found within health systems.
Hence, one cannot complacently assume that randomization can reduce or eliminate bias and confounding to the same degree in every instance.
The authors suggest that the latter may be informative and that the reasons behind it should be explored and not ignored.
Based on improved understanding of the value and possible limitations of RCTs on health system interventions, the authors show why we need broader platforms of research to complement RCTs.


Abstract
Markets for life-saving vaccines do not often generate the most desired outcomes from a public health perspective in terms of product quantity, quality, affordability, programmatic suitability and/or sustainability for use in the lowest income countries.
The pilot initiative Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for pneumococcal vaccines, launched in 2009, aims to remove some of these market risks by providing a legally binding forward commitment to purchase vaccines according to predetermined terms.
This paper describes early lessons learnt on the selection of a target disease and the core design choices for the pilot AMC.
It highlights the challenges faced with tailoring the AMC design to the specific supply situation of pneumococcal vaccines.
It points to the difficulty - and the AMC's apparent early success - in establishing a long-term, credible commitment in a constantly changing unpredictable environment.
It highlights one of the inherent challenges of the AMC: its dependence on continuous donor funding to ensure long-term purchases of products.
The paper examines alternative design choices and aims to provide a starting point to inform discussions and encourage debate about the potential application of the AMC concept to other fields.


Abstract
Both published and unpublished research on lay health workers has largely focused on the types of interventions they can deliver effectively.
This is an imperative since the main objective of these programmes is to improve health outcomes.
However, high attrition rates can undermine the effectiveness of these programmes.
There is a lack of research on lay health worker attrition.
Research that aims to answer the following three key questions would help address this knowledge gap: what is the magnitude of attrition in programmes?
What are the determinants of attrition?
What are the most successful ways of reducing attrition?
With community-based interventions and task shifting high on the United Nations Millennium Development Goals' policy agenda, research on lay health worker attrition and its determinants requires urgent attention.


Abstract
International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities.
Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channelled towards the development of new medical interventions.
This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries.
These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities.
Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public-private partnerships for neglected diseases.
This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research.
Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.


Abstract
Alcohol is the third leading contributor to death and disability in South Africa, where SABMiller is the major supplier of malt beer, the most popular beverage consumed.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) has recently included SABMiller as a recipient of funding for an education intervention aimed at minimizing alcohol-related harm, including HIV prevention, among men in drinking establishments.
Global Fund support for this initiative is cause for concern.
It is debatable whether these men are the best target group for the intervention, whether a drinking establishment is the best location, and whether the educational intervention itself is effective.
Our experience is that the liquor industry is inclined to support alcohol interventions that will not affect drinking rates at a population level.
These interventions allow the industry to simultaneously fulfil social and legal obligations to address the harmful use of alcohol while ensuring that sales and profits are maintained.
Providing funding for a highly profitable industry that could afford to fund its own interventions also reduces the funds available for less well-resourced organizations.
Do we take it that the problem of "corporate capture" has now spread to one of the largest health funders in the world?


Abstract
Tropical storms, such as cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons, present major threats to coastal communities.
Around two million people worldwide have died and millions have been injured over the past two centuries as a result of tropical storms.
Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to tropical cyclones, with around 718 000 deaths from them in the past 50 years.
However, cyclone-related mortality in Bangladesh has declined by more than 100-fold over the past 40 years, from 500 000 deaths in 1970 to 4234 in 2007.
The main factors responsible for these reduced fatalities and injuries are improved defensive measures, including early warning systems, cyclone shelters, evacuation plans, coastal embankments, reforestation schemes and increased awareness and communication.
Although warning systems have been improved, evacuation before a cyclone remains a challenge, with major problems caused by illiteracy, lack of awareness and poor communication.
Despite the potential risks of climate change and tropical storms, little empirical knowledge exists on how to develop effective strategies to reduce or mitigate the effects of cyclones.
This paper summarizes the most recent data and outlines the strategy adopted in Bangladesh.
It offers guidance on how similar strategies can be adopted by other countries vulnerable to tropical storms.
Further research is needed to enable countries to limit the risks that cyclones present to public health.


Abstract
Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.


Abstract
E-health encompasses a diverse set of informatics tools that have been designed to improve public health and health care.
Little information is available on the impacts of e-health programmes, particularly in low-and middle-income countries.
We therefore conducted a scoping review of the published and non-published literature to identify data on the effects of e-health on health outcomes and costs.
The emphasis was on the identification of unanswered questions for future research, particularly on topics relevant to low-and middle-income countries.
Although e-health tools supporting clinical practice have growing penetration globally, there is more evidence of benefits for tools that support clinical decisions and laboratory information systems than for those that support picture archiving and communication systems.
Community information systems for disease surveillance have been implemented successfully in several low-and middle-income countries.
Although information on outcomes is generally lacking, a large project in Brazil has documented notable impacts on health-system efficiency.
Meta-analyses and rigorous trials have documented the benefits of text messaging for improving outcomes such as patients' self-care.
Automated telephone monitoring and self-care support calls have been shown to improve some outcomes of chronic disease management, such as glycaemia and blood pressure control, in low-and middle-income countries.
Although large programmes for e-health implementation and research are being conducted in many low-and middle-income countries, more information on the impacts of e-health on outcomes and costs in these settings is still needed.


Abstract
The Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria is an innovative financing mechanism, managed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
This initiative aims to increase the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating malaria.
A pilot is underway in eight countries to determine whether the mechanism reduces the consumer price of these drugs and increases their availability in public and private outlets, their market share and their use.
To evaluate the pilot, an analysis was done to estimate predetermined "benchmarks" of success at 1 and 2 years.
The analysis used a mixed-methods approach, triangulating data from a literature review with information from 33 interviews with experts.
A sensitivity analysis and other methods were used to verify the results.
Benchmarks used to determine success include an increase in availability of artemisinin-based combination therapies of 40 percentage points from baseline, and an increase in their use of 10-15 percentage points from baseline at year 2.
These benchmarks were based on evidence that national public health programmes aimed at increasing the use of a specific health commodity in developing countries have generally achieved only modest changes in use within a 2-year time frame.
Evaluation should also take individual country contexts into account.


Abstract
In urban China, mortality from injuries has increased over the past five decades.
By contrast, life expectancy has continued to increase and has come to nearly equal life expectancy in developed countries.
Currently, most of the life expectancy lost due to injury (65%) in urban China would be recovered if injury rates were the same as in countries with low injury-related mortality.
Fundamentally, the rising trend in urban injury mortality in China reflects a continued focus on injury treatment rather than prevention in the face of fast socioeconomic development and increasing exposure to risk factors for injury.
Despite improved injury prevention legislation and a "Safe Community" campaign, urban China needs to modify its approach to urban injury management and focus on prevention.
The gap between urban China and countries with low injury mortality can be closed by means of legislation, strengthened law enforcement and the establishment of safer communities.
Risks affecting children and migrants deserve greater attention, and the government needs to allocate more resources to injury prevention, especially to urban areas in the central-west region of China.
Based on the population size of urban China, measures for the prevention of injury mortality would save an annual 436.4 million years of life.


Abstract
Agricultural pesticide use in Viet Nam has more than tripled since 1990.
However, pesticide legislation and regulations have not been developed in response to this large increase in usage, as a result of which pesticides pose a serious threat to human health and the environment.


Abstract
The rise in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis makes it increasingly important that antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis produce clinically meaningful and technically reproducible results.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case because mycobacteriology specialists have not followed generally accepted modern principles for the establishment of susceptibility breakpoints for bacterial and fungal pathogens.
These principles specifically call for a definition of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) applicable to organisms without resistance mechanisms (also known as wild-type MIC distributions), to be used in combination with data on clinical outcomes, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
In a series of papers the authors have defined tentative wild-type MIC distributions for M. tuberculosis and hope that other researchers will follow their example and provide confirmatory data.
They suggest that some breakpoints are in need of revision because they either (i) bisect the wild-type distribution, which leads to poor reproducibility in antimicrobial susceptibility testing, or (ii) are substantially higher than the MICs of wild-type organisms without supporting clinical evidence, which may result in some strains being falsely reported as susceptible.
The authors recommend, in short, that susceptibility breakpoints for antituberculosis agents be systematically reviewed and revised, if necessary, using the same modern tools now accepted for all other bacteria and fungi by the scientific community and by the European Medicines Agency and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
For several agents this would greatly improve the accuracy and reproducibility of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis


Abstract
The model estimates the number of new HIV infections that will be acquired over the ensuing year by individuals in identified risk groups in a given population using data on the size of the groups, the aggregate risk behaviour in each group, the current prevalence of HIV infection among the sexual or injecting drug partners of individuals in each group, and the probability of HIV transmission associated with different risk behaviours.
The strength of the model is its simplicity, which enables data from a variety of sources to be synthesized, resulting in better characterization of HIV epidemics in some settings.
However, concerns have been raised about the assumptions underlying the model structure, about limitations in the data available for deriving input parameters and about interpretation and communication of the model results.
The aim of this review was to improve the use of the model by reassessing its paradigm, structure and data requirements.
We identified key questions to be asked when conducting an analysis and when interpreting the model results and make recommendations for strengthening the model's application in the future.


Abstract
A national drinking water quality survey conducted in 2009 furnished data that were used to make an updated estimate of chronic arsenic exposure in Bangladesh.
About 20 million and 45 million people were found to be exposed to concentrations above the national standard of 50 µg/L and the World Health Organization's guideline value of 10 µg/L, respectively.
An arsenic-related mortality rate of 1 in every 18 adult deaths could represent an economic burden of 13 billion United States dollars (US$) in lost productivity alone over the next 20 years.
The effectiveness of such an approach was demonstrated during the United Nations Children's Fund 2006-2011 country programme, which provided safe water to arsenic-contaminated areas at a cost of US$ 11 per capita.
National scale-up of such an approach would cost a few hundred million US dollars but would improve the health and productivity of the population, especially in future generations.


Abstract
Public policy plays a key role in improving population health and in the control of diseases, including non-communicable diseases.
However, an evidence-based approach to formulating healthy public policy has been difficult to implement, partly on account of barriers that hinder integrated work between researchers and policy-makers.
This paper describes a "policy effectiveness-feasibility loop" (PEFL) that brings together epidemiological modelling, local situation analysis and option appraisal to foster collaboration between researchers and policy-makers.
Epidemiological modelling explores the determinants of trends in disease and the potential health benefits of modifying them.
Situation analysis investigates the current conceptualization of policy, the level of policy awareness and commitment among key stakeholders, and what actually happens in practice, thereby helping to identify policy gaps.
Option appraisal integrates epidemiological modelling and situation analysis to investigate the feasibility, costs and likely health benefits of various policy options.
The authors illustrate how PEFL was used in a project to inform public policy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in four parts of the eastern Mediterranean.
They conclude that PEFL may offer a useful framework for researchers and policy-makers to successfully work together to generate evidence-based policy, and they encourage further evaluation of this approach.


Abstract
The Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) are currently debating the substance and form of an international agreement to improve the financing and coordination of research and development (R&D) for health products that meet the needs of developing countries.
In addition to considering the content of any possible legal or political agreement, Member States may find it helpful to reflect on the full range of implementation mechanisms available to bring any agreement into effect.
These include mechanisms for states to make commitments, administer activities, manage financial contributions, make subsequent decisions, monitor each other's performance and promote compliance.
States can make binding or non-binding commitments through conventions, contracts, declarations or institutional reforms.
States can administer activities to implement their agreements through international organizations, sub-agencies, joint ventures or self-organizing processes.
Finances can be managed through specialized multilateral funds, financial institutions, membership organizations or coordinated self-management.
Decisions can be made through unanimity, consensus, equal voting, modified voting or delegation.
Oversight can be provided by peer review, expert review, self-reports or civil society.
Together, states should select their preferred options across categories of implementation mechanisms, each of which has advantages and disadvantages.
The challenge lies in choosing the most effective combinations of mechanisms for supporting an international agreement (or set of agreements) that achieves collective aspirations in a way and at a cost that are both sustainable and acceptable to those involved.
In making these decisions, WHO's Member States can benefit from years of experience with these different mechanisms in health and its related sectors.


Abstract
The Antibiotics Smart Use (ASU) programme was introduced in Thailand as a model to promote the rational use of medicines, starting with antibiotics.
The programme's first phase consisted of assessing interventions intended to change prescribing practices; the second phase examined the feasibility of programme scale-up.
Currently the programme is in its third phase, which centres on sustainability.
Despite limited resources, programme scale-up and sustainability have been facilitated by the promotion of local ownership and mutual recognition, which have generated pride and commitment.
ASU is clearly a workable entry point for efforts to rationalize the use of medicines in Thailand.
Its long-term sustainability will require continued local commitment and political support, effective auditing and integration of ASU into routine systems with appropriate financial incentives.


Abstract
Low-cost technologies to diagnose and monitor human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developing countries are a major subject of current research and health care in the developing world.
With the great need to increase access to affordable HIV monitoring services in rural areas of developing countries, much work has been focus on the development of point-of-care technologies that are affordable, robust, easy to use, portable and of sufficient quantitative accuracy to enable clinical decision-making.
For diagnosis of HIV infection, some low-cost tests, such as lateral flow tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, are already in place and well established.
However, portable quantitative tests for rapid HIV monitoring at the point of care have only recently been introduced to the market.
In this review, we discuss low-cost tests for HIV diagnosis and monitoring in low-resource settings, including promising technologies for use at the point of care, that are available or close to market.


Abstract
The World Health Organization (WHO) revised its global recommendations on treating pregnant women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with antiretrovirals and preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV.
Initial draft recommendations issued in November 2009 were followed by a full revised guideline in July 2010.
The 2010 recommendations on PMTCT have important implications in terms of planning, human capacity and resources.
Ministries of health therefore had to adapt their national guidelines to reflect the 2010 PMTCT recommendations, and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation tracked the adaptation process in the 14 countries where it provides technical support.
In doing so it sought to understand common issues, challenges, and the decisions reached and to properly target its technical assistance.
Governments used various processes and fora to make decisions throughout the adaptation process; they considered factors such as feasibility, health delivery infrastructure, compatibility with 2006 WHO guidelines, equity and cost.


Abstract
Systematically archiving data from health research and large-scale surveys and ensuring access to databases offer economic benefits and can improve the accountability, efficiency and quality of scientific research.
Recently, interest in data archiving and sharing has grown and, in developed countries, research funders and institutions are increasingly adopting data-sharing policies.
In developing countries, however, there is a lack of awareness of the benefits of data archiving and little discussion of policy.
Many databases, even those of large-scale surveys, are not preserved systematically and access for secondary use is limited, which reduces the return on research investment.
Several obstacles exist: organizational responsibility is unclear; infrastructure and personnel with appropriate data management and analysis skills are scarce; and researchers may be reluctant to share.
This article considers recent progress in data sharing and the strategies and models used to encourage and facilitate it, with a focus on the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region.
A case study from the Philippines demonstrates the benefits of data sharing by comparing the number and type of publications associated with two large-scale surveys with different approaches to sharing.
Advocacy and leadership are needed at both national and regional levels to increase awareness.
A step-by-step approach may be the most effective: initially large national databases could be made available to develop the methods and skills needed and to foster a data-sharing culture.
Duplication of costs and effort could be avoided by collaboration between countries.
In developing countries, interventions are required to build capacity in data management and analysis.


Abstract
Low fruit and vegetable consumption is an important contributor to the global burden of disease.
In the wake of the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), held in September 2011, a rise in the consumption of fruits and vegetables is foreseeable and this increased demand will have to be met through improved supply.
The paper seeks to enable public health policy-makers, practitioners and advocates to improve coherence between trade and public health policies by highlighting Aid for Trade's potential role in this endeavour.


Abstract
Twelve agencies of the United Nations, including the World Health Organization, have issued a joint statement that calls on Member States to replace the compulsory detention of people who use opioids in treatment centres with voluntary, evidence-informed and rights-based health and social services.
The arguments in favour of this position fall into three broad categories: Compulsory treatment centres infringe on an individual's liberty, they put human beings at risk of harm, and evidence of their effectiveness against opioid dependence has not been generated.
The United Nations statement underscores that although countries apply different criteria for sending individuals to compulsory treatment centres, detention often takes place without due process, legal safeguards or judicial review.
This clearly violates internationally recognized human rights standards.
Furthermore, people who are committed to these centres are often exposed to physical and sexual violence, forced labour and sub-standard living conditions.
They are often denied health care, despite their heightened vulnerability to HIV infection and tuberculosis.
Finally, there is no evidence, according to the statement, that these centres offer an environment that is conducive to recovery from opioid dependence or to the rehabilitation of commercial sex workers or of children who have suffered sexual exploitation, abuse or lack of care and protection.
The author of this paper sets forth several arguments that counter the position taken by the United Nations and argues in favour of compulsory treatment within a broader harm reduction strategy aimed at protecting society as well as the individual concerned.


Abstract
The contribution made by the private sector to health care in a low- or middle-income country may affect levels of physician emigration from that country.
The increasing importance of the private sector in health care in the developing world has resulted in newfound academic interest in that sector's influences on many aspects of national health systems.
The growth in physician emigration from the developing world has led to several attempts to identify both the factors that cause physicians to emigrate and the effects of physician emigration on primary care and population health in the countries that the physicians leave.
When the relevant data on the emerging economies of Ghana, India and Peru were investigated, it appeared that the proportion of physicians participating in private health-care delivery, the percentage of health-care costs financed publicly and the amount of private health-care financing per capita were each inversely related to the level of physician expatriation.
It therefore appears that private health-care delivery and financing may decrease physician emigration.
There is clearly a need for similar research in other low- and middle-income countries, and for studies to see if, at the country level, temporal trends in the contribution made to health care by the private sector can be related to the corresponding trends in physician emigration.
The ways in which private health care may be associated with access problems for the poor and therefore reduced equity also merit further investigation.
The results should be of interest to policy-makers who aim to improve health systems worldwide.


Abstract
In China, alcohol consumption is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world.
A steady increase in alcohol production has also been observed in the country, together with a rise in alcohol-related harm.


Abstract
In theory, the removal of user fees puts health services within reach of everyone, including the very poor.
When Burkina Faso adopted the DOTS strategy for the control of tuberculosis, the intention was to provide free tuberculosis care.
In 2007 - 2008, interviews were used to collect information from 242 smear-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were enrolled in the national tuberculosis control programme in six rural districts.
The median direct costs associated with tuberculosis were estimated at 101 United States dollars (US$) per patient.
These costs represented 23% of the mean annual income of a patient's household.
During the course of their care, three quarters of the interviewed patients apparently faced "catastrophic" health expenditure.
Inadequacies in the health system and policies appeared to be responsible for nearly half of the direct costs (US$ 45 per patient).
Although the households of patients developed coping strategies, these had far-reaching, adverse effects on the quality of lives of the households' members and the socioeconomic stability of the households.
Each tuberculosis patient lost a median of 45 days of work as a result of the illness.
For a population living on or below the poverty line, every failure in health-care delivery increases the risk of "catastrophic" health expenditure, exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities, and reduces the probability of adequate treatment and cure.
In Burkina Faso, a policy of "free" care for tuberculosis patients has not met with complete success.
These observations should help define post-2015 global strategies for tuberculosis care, prevention and control.


Abstract
Although the 99% decrease seen in global polio incidence between 1988 and 2000 represented remarkable progress towards polio eradication, tackling the last 1% of polio has proved tantalizingly difficult.
Pockets of endemic transmission currently persist both on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
These pockets have permitted the reinfection of countries that were previously polio-free.
Global strategic plans for polio eradication set out the activities, resources and financing needed to overcome the managerial, technical and security challenges faced by those tasked with the interruption of poliovirus transmission.
However, polio eradication also depends on the less tangible but equally important human qualities of energy, realism, articulacy, determination, imagination, collaboration, adaptability, tactical awareness, innovation, openness and nimbleness (the initial letters of which give the acronym "ERADICATION").
By paying attention to these human qualities, the stakeholders involved may be more likely to achieve global polio eradication.


Abstract
Humanitarian emergencies result in a breakdown of critical health-care services and often make vulnerable communities dependent on external agencies for care.
In resource-constrained settings, this may occur against a backdrop of extreme poverty, malnutrition, insecurity, low literacy and poor infrastructure.
Under these circumstances, providing food, water and shelter and limiting communicable disease outbreaks become primary concerns.
Where effective and safe vaccines are available to mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, their potential deployment is a key consideration in meeting emergency health needs.
Ethical considerations are crucial when deciding on vaccine deployment.
Allocation of vaccines in short supply, target groups, delivery strategies, surveillance and research during acute humanitarian emergencies all involve ethical considerations that often arise from the tension between individual and common good.
The authors lay out the ethical issues that policy-makers need to bear in mind when considering the deployment of mass vaccination during humanitarian emergencies, including beneficence (duty of care and the rule of rescue), non-maleficence, autonomy and consent, and distributive and procedural justice.


Abstract
The World Health Organization has promoted health impact assessment (HIA) for over 20 years.
At the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), HIA was discussed as a critical method for linking health to "green economy" and "institutional framework" strategies for sustainable development.
In countries having a high human development index (HDI), HIA has been added to the overall assessment suite that typically includes potential environmental and social impacts, but it is rarely required as part of the environmental and social impact assessment for large development projects.
When they are performed, project-driven HIAs are governed by a combination of project proponent and multilateral lender performance standards rather than host country requirements.
Not surprisingly, in low-HDI countries HIA is missing from the programme and policy arena in the absence of an external project driver.
We analyse where and how HIA can become fully integrated into the impact assessment suite and argue that the impact of HIA must not remain obscure.


Abstract
The problem of how to mitigate the impact of pharmaceutical patents on the delivery of essential medicines to the world's poor is as far from being resolved as it has ever been.
Extensive academic commentary and policy debate have achieved little in terms of practical outcomes.
Although international instruments are now in place allowing countries to enact legislation that permits the generic manufacture of patented pharmaceuticals, many countries have not yet enacted appropriate legislation and most of those that have yet to make use of it.
One major problem is that the requirements of international instruments and implementing legislation are seen as being so stringent as to be unworkable.
This paper calls for fresh attempts to enact workable legislation that fits within the prescribed requirements of international law without going beyond them.
It argues that high-income nations should refocus on their moral obligation to enact appropriate legislative mechanisms and provide appropriate incentives for their use.
Draft legislation currently being considered in Australia is used to illustrate how workable legislative frameworks can be developed.


Abstract
Abstract Unless the concept is clearly understood, “universal coverage” (or universal health coverage, UHC) can be used to justify practically any health financing reform or scheme.
This paper unpacks the definition of health financing for universal coverage as used in the World Health Organization's World health report 2010 to show how UHC embodies specific health system goals and intermediate objectives and, broadly, how health financing reforms can influence these.
All countries seek to improve equity in the use of health services, service quality and financial protection for their populations.
Hence, the pursuit of UHC is relevant to every country.
Health financing policy is an integral part of efforts to move towards UHC, but for health financing policy to be aligned with the pursuit of UHC, health system reforms need to be aimed explicitly at improving coverage and the intermediate objectives linked to it, namely, efficiency, equity in health resource distribution and transparency and accountability.
The unit of analysis for goals and objectives must be the population and health system as a whole.
What matters is not how a particular financing scheme affects its individual members, but rather, how it influences progress towards UHC at the population level.
Concern only with specific schemes is incompatible with a universal coverage approach and may even undermine UHC, particularly in terms of equity.
Conversely, if a scheme is fully oriented towards system-level goals and objectives, it can further progress towards UHC.
Policy and policy analysis need to shift from the scheme to the system level.


Abstract
Abstract The health concerns of women in their mid-adult years – when the prime age of reproduction has passed – have been traditionally given little or no attention by health systems and donors, despite the heavy burden that diseases such as breast and cervical cancer impose on women and their families.
The risk of sexually transmitted infections that accompanies sexual relations and the risk of death and morbidity associated with pregnancy have long been recognized and have stimulated major control efforts that are finally yielding positive results.
Much less attention has been focused, however, on how experiences in early life can affect women's health in adulthood.
Breast and cervical cancers kill more women than any other types of cancer in all parts of the developing world.
In most of Asia and Latin America and some African countries, deaths from these two forms of cancer now outnumber pregnancy-related deaths.
There are five compelling reasons for focusing on these cancers now to try to reverse these epidemiologic trends: (i) the burden of breast and cervical cancer is large and is growing; (ii) effective screening and treatment are available; (iii) research is generating new knowledge; (iv) there are opportunities for synergy with other health programmes; and (v) noncommunicable diseases are the focus of much current interest.


Abstract
The maldistribution of health workers between urban and rural areas is a policy concern in virtually all countries.
It prevents equitable access to health services, can contribute to increased health-care costs and underutilization of health professional skills in urban areas, and is a barrier to universal health coverage.
To address this long-standing concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued global recommendations to improve the rural recruitment and retention of the health workforce.
This paper presents experiences with local and regional adaptation and adoption of WHO recommendations.
It highlights challenges and lessons learnt in implementation in two countries – the Lao People's Democratic Republic and South Africa – and provides a broader perspective in two regions – Asia and Europe.
At country level, the use of the recommendations facilitated a more structured and focused policy dialogue, which resulted in the development and adoption of more relevant and evidence-based policies.
At regional level, the recommendations sparked a more sustained effort for cross-country policy assessment and joint learning.
There is a need for impact assessment and evaluation that focus on the links between the rural availability of health workers and universal health coverage.
The effects of any health-financing reforms on incentive structures for health workers will also have to be assessed if the central role of more equitably distributed health workers in achieving universal health coverage is to be supported.


Abstract
Human resources for health have been recognized as essential to the development of responsive and effective health systems.
Low- and middle-income countries seeking to achieve universal health coverage face human resource constraints – whether in the form of health worker shortages, maldistribution of workers or poor worker performance – that seriously undermine their ability to achieve well-functioning health systems.
Although much has been written about the human resource crisis in the health sector, labour economic frameworks have seldom been applied to analyse the situation and little is known or understood about the operation of labour markets in low- and middle-income countries.
Traditional approaches to addressing human resource constraints have focused on workforce planning: estimating health workforce requirements based on a country's epidemiological and demographic profile and scaling up education and training capacities to narrow the gap between the “needed” number of health workers and the existing number.
However, this approach neglects other important factors that influence human resource capacity, including labour market dynamics and the behavioural responses and preferences of the health workers themselves.
This paper describes how labour market analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the factors behind human resource constraints in the health sector and to a more effective design of policies and interventions to address them.
The premise is that a better understanding of the impact of health policies on health labour markets, and subsequently on the employment conditions of health workers, would be helpful in identifying an effective strategy towards the progressive attainment of universal health coverage.


Abstract
To achieve universal health coverage, health systems will have to reach into every community, including the poorest and hardest to access.
Since Alma-Ata, inconsistent support of community health workers (CHWs) and failure to integrate them into the health system have impeded full realization of their potential contribution in the context of primary health care.
Scaling up and maintaining CHW programmes is fraught with a host of challenges: poor planning; multiple competing actors with little coordination; fragmented, disease-specific training; donor-driven management and funding; tenuous linkage with the health system; poor coordination, supervision and support, and under-recognition of CHWs' contribution.
The current drive towards universal health coverage (UHC) presents an opportunity to enhance people's access to health services and their trust, demand and use of such services through CHWs.
For their potential to be fully realized, however, CHWs will need to be better integrated into national health-care systems in terms of employment, supervision, support and career development.
Partners at the global, national and district levels will have to harmonize and synchronize their engagement in CHW support while maintaining enough flexibility for programmes to innovate and respond to local needs.
Strong leadership from the public sector will be needed to facilitate alignment with national policy frameworks and country-led coordination and to achieve synergies and accountability, universal coverage and sustainability.
In moving towards UHC, much can be gained by investing in building CHWs' skills and supporting them as valued members of the health team.
Stand-alone investments in CHWs are no shortcut to progress.


Abstract
Achieving universal health coverage (UHC) involves distributing resources, especially human resources for health (HRH), to match population needs.
This paper explores the policy lessons on HRH from four countries that have achieved sustained improvements in UHC: Brazil, Ghana, Mexico and Thailand.
Its purpose is to inform global policy and financial commitments on HRH in support of UHC.
The paper reports on country experiences using an analytical framework that examines effective coverage in relation to the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality (AAAQ) of HRH.
The AAAQ dimensions make it possible to perform tracing analysis on HRH policy actions since 1990 in the four countries of interest in relation to national trends in workforce numbers and population mortality rates.
The findings inform key principles for evidence-based decision-making on HRH in support of UHC.
First, HRH are critical to the expansion of health service coverage and the package of benefits; second, HRH strategies in each of the AAAQ dimensions collectively support achievements in effective coverage; and third, success is achieved through partnerships involving health and non-health actors.
Facing the unprecedented health and development challenges that affect all countries and transforming HRH evidence into policy and practice must be at the heart of UHC and the post-2015 development agenda.
It is a political imperative requiring national commitment and leadership to maximize the impact of available financial and human resources, and improve healthy life expectancy, with the recognition that improvements in health care are enabled by a health workforce that is fit for purpose.


Abstract
Human resources for health (HRH) will have to be strengthened if universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved.
Existing health workforce benchmarks focus exclusively on the density of physicians, nurses and midwives and were developed with the objective of attaining relatively high coverage of skilled birth attendance and other essential health services of relevance to the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
However, the attainment of UHC will depend not only on the availability of adequate numbers of health workers, but also on the distribution, quality and performance of the available health workforce.
In addition, as noncommunicable diseases grow in relative importance, the inputs required from health workers are changing.
New, broader health-workforce benchmarks – and a corresponding monitoring framework – therefore need to be developed and included in the agenda for UHC to catalyse attention and investment in this critical area of health systems.
The new benchmarks need to reflect the more diverse composition of the health workforce and the participation of community health workers and mid-level health workers, and they must capture the multifaceted nature and complexities of HRH development, including equity in accessibility, sex composition and quality.


Abstract
Population-based disease prevalence surveys raise ethical questions, including whether participants should be routinely told their test results.
Ethical guidelines call for informing survey participants of any clinically relevant finding to enable appropriate management.
However, in anonymous surveys of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, participants can “opt out” of being given their test results or are offered the chance to undergo voluntary HIV testing in local counselling and testing services.
This is aimed at minimizing survey participation bias.
Those who opt out of being given their HIV test results and who do not seek their results miss the opportunity to receive life-saving antiretroviral therapy.
The justification for HIV surveys without routine feedback of results to participants is based on a public health utility argument: that the benefits of more rigorous survey methods – reduced participation bias – outweigh the benefits to individuals of knowing their HIV status.
However, people with HIV infection have a strong immediate interest in knowing their HIV status.
In consideration of the ethical value of showing respect for people and thereby alleviating suffering, an argument based on public health utility is not an appropriate justification.
In anonymous HIV surveys as well as other prevalence surveys of treatable conditions in any setting, participation should be on the basis of routine individual feedback of results as an integral part of fully informed participation.
Ensuring that surveys are ethically sound may stimulate participation, increase a broader uptake of HIV testing and reduce stigmatization of people who are HIV-positive.


Abstract
During the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) asked all Member States to provide case-based data on at least the first 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases to generate an early understanding of the pandemic and provide appropriate guidance to affected countries.
In reviewing the pandemic surveillance strategy, we evaluated the utility of case-based data collection and the challenges in interpreting these data at the global level.
To do this, we assessed compliance with the surveillance recommendation and data completeness of submitted case records and described the epidemiological characteristics of up to the first 110 reported cases from each country, aggregated into regions.
From April 2009 to August 2011, WHO received over 18 000 case records from 84 countries.
Data reached WHO at different time intervals, in different formats and without information on collection methods.
Descriptive epidemiological analyses were limited to summarizing age, sex and hospitalization ratios.
Centralized analysis of case-based data had little value in describing key features of the pandemic.


Abstract
Fewer than 20% of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are receiving treatment and there is an urgent need to scale up treatment programmes.
One of the biggest barriers to scale-up is the treatment regimen, which is lengthy, complex, ineffective, poorly tolerated and expensive.
For the first time in over 50 years, new drugs have been developed specifically to treat tuberculosis, with bedaquiline and potentially delamanid expected to be available soon for treatment of MDR cases.
However, if the new drugs are merely added to the current treatment regimen, the new regimen will be at least as lengthy, cumbersome and toxic as the existing one.
There is an urgent need for strategy and evidence on how to maximize the potential of the new drugs to improve outcomes and shorten treatment.
We devised eight key principles for designing future treatment regimens to ensure that, once they are proven safe in clinical trials, they will be clinically effective and programmatically practicable.
Regimens should contain at least one new class of drug; be broadly applicable for use against MDR and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains; contain three to five effective drugs, each from a different drug class; be delivered orally; have a simple dosing schedule; have a good side-effect profile that allows limited monitoring; last a maximum of 6 months; and have minimal interaction with antiretrovirals.
Following these principles will maximize the potential of new compounds and help to overcome the clinical and programmatic disadvantages and scale-up constraints that plague the current regimen.


Abstract
Philip Morris has recently brought claims against Australia (2011) and Uruguay (2010) under international investment agreements (IIAs).
The claims allege that Philip Morris is entitled to compensation following the introduction of innovative tobacco packaging regulations to reduce smoking and prevent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
Since tobacco control measures are often viewed as a model for public health nutrition measures, the claims raise the question of how investment law governs the latter.
This paper begins to answer this question and to explain how governments can proactively protect policy space for public health nutrition in an era of expanding IIAs.
The authors first consider the main interventions proposed to reduce diet-related NCDs and their intersection with investment in the food supply chain.
They then review the nature of investment regimes and relevant case law and examine ways to maximize policy space for public health nutrition intervention within this legal context.
As foreign investment increases across the food-chain and more global recommendations discouraging the consumption of unhealthful products are issued, investment law will increase in importance as part of the legal architecture governing the food supply.
The implications of investment law for public health nutrition measures depend on various factors: the measures themselves, the terms of the applicable agreements, the conditions surrounding the foreign investment and the policies governing agricultural support.
This analysis suggests that governments should adopt proactive measures – e.g. the clarification of terms and reliance on exceptions – to manage investment and protect their regulatory autonomy with respect to public health nutrition.


Abstract
Africa has the highest disease burden in the world and continues to depend on pharmaceutical imports to meet public health needs.
As Asian manufacturers of generic medicines begin to operate under a more protectionist intellectual property regime, their ability to manufacture medicines at prices that are affordable to poorer countries is becoming more circumscribed.
The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health gives member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the right to adopt legislation permitting the use of patented material without authorization by the patent holder, a provision known as “compulsory licensing”.
For African countries to take full advantage of compulsory licensing they must develop substantial local manufacturing capacity.
Because building manufacturing capacity in each African country is daunting and almost illusory, an African free trade area should be developed to serve as a platform not only for the free movement of goods made pursuant to compulsory licences, but also for an economic or financial collaboration towards the development of strong pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in the continent.
Most countries in Africa are in the United Nations list of least developed countries, and this allows them, under WTO law, to refuse to grant patents for pharmaceuticals until 2021.
Thus, there is a compelling need for African countries to collaborate to build strong pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in the continent now, while the current flexibilities in international intellectual property law offer considerable benefits.


Abstract
The CARICOM Summit on Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases – the first government summit ever devoted to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) – was convened by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in Trinidad and Tobago in September 2007.
Leaders in attendance issued the declaration of Port of Spain, a call for the prevention and control of four major NCDs and their risk factors.
An accountability instrument for monitoring compliance with summit commitments was developed for CARICOM by the University of the West Indies in 2008 and revised in 2010.
The instrument – a one-page colour-coded grid with 26 progress indicators – is updated annually by focal points in Caribbean health ministries, verified by each country’s chief medical officer and presented to the annual Caucus of Caribbean Community Ministers of Health.
In this study, the G8 Research Group’s methods for assessing compliance were applied to the 2009 reporting grid to assess each country’s performance.
Given the success of the CARICOM Summit, a United Nations high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs was held in September 2011.
In May 2013 the World Health Assembly adopted nine global targets and 25 indicators to measure progress in NCD control.
This study shows that the CARICOM monitoring grid can be used to document progress on such indicators quickly and comprehensibly.
An annual reporting mechanism is essential to encourage steady progress and highlight areas needing correction.
This paper underscores the importance of accountability mechanisms for encouraging and monitoring compliance with the collective political commitments acquired at the highest level.


Abstract
Timor-Leste is in the process of addressing a key issue for the country’s health sector: a medical workforce that is too small to provide adequate care.
In theory, a bilateral programme of medical cooperation with Cuba created in 2003 could solve this problem.
By the end of 2013, nearly 700 new doctors trained in Cuba had been added to Timor-Leste’s medical workforce and by 2017 a further 328 doctors should have been trained in the country by Cuban and local health professionals.
A few more doctors who have been trained in Indonesia and elsewhere will also soon enter the workforce.
It is expected that the number of physicians in Timor-Leste in 2017 will be more than three times the number present in the country in 2003.
Most of the new physicians are expected to work in rural communities and support the national government’s goal of improving health outcomes for the rural majority.
Although the massive growth in the medical workforce could change the way health care is delivered and substantially improve health outcomes throughout the country, there are challenges that must be overcome if Timor-Leste is to derive the maximum benefit from such growth.
It appears crucial that most of the new doctors be deployed in rural communities and managed carefully to optimize their rural retention.


Abstract
Existing and proposed metrics for household drinking-water services are intended to measure the availability, safety and accessibility of water sources.
However, these attributes can be highly variable over time and space and this variation complicates the task of creating and implementing simple and scalable metrics.
In this paper, we highlight those factors – especially those that relate to so-called improved water sources – that contribute to variability in water safety but may not be generally recognized as important by non-experts.
Problems in the provision of water in adequate quantities and of adequate quality – interrelated problems that are often influenced by human behaviour – may contribute to an increased risk of poor health.
Such risk may be masked by global water metrics that indicate that we are on the way to meeting the world’s drinking-water needs.
Given the complexity of the topic and current knowledge gaps, international metrics for access to drinking water should be interpreted with great caution.
We need further targeted research on the health impacts associated with improvements in drinking-water supplies.

At any age, disabling hearing impairment has a profound impact on interpersonal communication, psychosocial well-being, quality of life and economic independence.
According to the World Health Organization’s estimates, the number of people with such impairment increased from 42 million in 1985 to about 360 million in 2011.
This last figure includes 7.5 million children less than 5 years of age.
In 1995, a “roadmap” for curtailing the burden posed by disabling hearing impairment was outlined in a resolution of the World Health Assembly.
While the underlying principle of this roadmap remains valid and relevant, some updating is required to reflect the prevailing epidemiologic transition.
We examine the traditional concept and grades of disabling hearing impairment – within the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health – as well as the modifications to grading that have recently been proposed by a panel of international experts.
The opportunity offered by the emerging global and high-level interest in promoting disability-inclusive post-2015 development goals and disability-free child survival is also discussed.
Since the costs of rehabilitative services are so high as to be prohibitive in low- and middle-income countries, the critical role of primary prevention is emphasized.
If the goals outlined in the World Health Assembly’s 1995 resolution on the prevention of hearing impairment are to be reached by Member States, several effective country-level initiatives – including the development of public–private partnerships, strong leadership and measurable time-bound targets – will have to be implemented without further delay.


Abstract
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – are currently undergoing a deep epidemiological transition that is mainly driven by rapid economic growth and technological change.
The changes being observed in the distribution of the burden of diseases and injuries – such as recent increases in the incidence of road traffic injuries – are matters of concern.
BRICS may need stronger institutional capacity to address such changes in a timely way.
In this paper, we present data on road traffic injuries in BRICS and illustrate the enormous challenge that these countries currently face in reducing the incidence of such injuries.
There is an urgent need to improve road safety indicators in every country constituting BRICS.
It is imperative for BRICS to invest in system-wide road safety interventions and reduce the mortality and morbidity from road traffic injuries.


Abstract
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – represent some of the world’s fastest growing large economies and nearly 40% of the world’s population.
Over the last two decades, BRICS have undertaken health-system reforms to make progress towards universal health coverage.
This paper discusses three key aspects of these reforms: the role of government in financing health; the underlying motivation behind the reforms; and the value of the lessons learnt for non-BRICS countries.
Although national governments have played a prominent role in the reforms, private financing constitutes a major share of health spending in BRICS.
There is a reliance on direct expenditures in China and India and a substantial presence of private insurance in Brazil and South Africa.
The Brazilian health reforms resulted from a political movement that made health a constitutional right, whereas those in China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa were an attempt to improve the performance of the public system and reduce inequities in access.
The move towards universal health coverage has been slow.
In China and India, the reforms have not adequately addressed the issue of out-of-pocket payments.
Negotiations between national and subnational entities have often been challenging but Brazil has been able to achieve good coordination between federal and state entities via a constitutional delineation of responsibility.
In the Russian Federation, poor coordination has led to the fragmented pooling and inefficient use of resources.
In mixed health systems it is essential to harness both public and private sector resources.


Abstract
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa – the countries known as BRICS – have made considerable progress in vaccine production, regulation and development over the past 20 years.
By 2014, all five countries had strong initiatives for the development of vaccine technology and had greatly improved their national regulatory capacity.
South Africa was then the only BRICS country that was not completely producing vaccines.
South Africa is now in the process of re-establishing its own vaccine production and passing beyond the stage of simply importing, formulating and filling vaccine bulks.
Changes in the public sector’s price per dose of selected vaccines, the global market share represented by products from specific manufacturers, and the attractiveness, for multinational companies, of partnership and investment opportunities in BRICS companies have all been analysed.
The results indicate that the BRICS countries have had a major impact on vaccine price and availability, with much of that impact attributable to the output of Indian vaccine manufacturers.
China is expected to have a greater impact soon, given the anticipated development of Chinese vaccine manufacturers in the near future.
BRICS’ accomplishments in the field of vaccine development are expected to reshape the global vaccine market and accelerate access to vaccines in the developing world.
The challenge is to turn these expectations into strategic actions and practical outcomes.


Abstract
The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of outreach to promote: efficient redeployment of the health-care workforce; continuity of care at the local level; and professional support for local, rural, health-care workers.
Australia is the only country that has had, since 2000, a sustained national policy on outreach for subsidizing medical specialist outreach to rural areas.
This paper describes the adoption, implementation and prioritization of a national specialist outreach policy in Australia.
Adoption of the national policy followed a long history of successful outreach, largely driven by the professional interest and personal commitment of the workforce.
Initially the policy supported only new outreach services but concerns about the sustainability of existing services resulted in eligibility for funding being extended to all specialist services.
The costs of travel, travel time, accommodation, professional support, staff relief at specialists’ primary practices and equipment hire were subsidized.
Over time, a national political commitment to the equitable treatment of indigenous people resulted in more targeted support for outreach in remote areas.
Current priorities are: (i) establishing team-based outreach services; (ii) improving local staff’s skills; (iii) achieving local coordination; and (iv) conducting a nationally consistent needs assessment.
The absence of subsidies for specialists’ clinical work can discourage private specialists from providing services in remote areas where clinical throughput is low.
To be successful, outreach policy must harmonize with the interests of the workforce and support professional autonomy.
Internationally, the development of outreach policy must take account of the local pay and practice conditions of health workers.


Abstract
The high profile investment claims filed by Philip Morris challenging Uruguayan and Australian measures that restrict advertising and logos on tobacco packaging awakened the public health community to the existence and potential detrimental impact of international investment agreements (IIAs).
More recently, Eli Lilly challenged Canada’s invalidation of a pharmaceutical patent under an IIA.
All of the cases claim that the intellectual property rights of the investor were infringed.
As a result of these cases, many commentators and activists view IIAs as a threat to public health and have lobbied against their inclusion in ongoing trade negotiations.
This article does not argue against IIAs.
Instead, it seeks to demonstrate how more sophisticated treaty drafting can neutralize the threat to public health.
In this regard, the article seeks to engage members of the public health community as campaigners not against IIAs but as advocates of better treaty drafting to ensure that IIAs do not infringe upon the right of a nation to take non-discriminatory measures for the promotion and protection of the health of their populations.


Abstract
Snakebite envenoming is a common but neglected public health problem, particularly in impoverished rural regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The only validated treatment for this condition is passive immunotherapy with safe and effective animal-derived antivenoms.
Such a multicomponent strategy involving stakeholders on many levels could help consolidate sustainable improvements in antivenom availability worldwide.


Abstract
Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015.
Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required.
Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries.
The Success Factors for Women’s and Children’s Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a.
There is no standard formula – fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change.
However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality.
First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants.
Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health.
Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change.
Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time.
This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women’s and children’s health towards 2015 and beyond.

Abstract
Two morphotypes of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva, 1912) have been described in Brazil one with one pair of pale tergal spots, the other one with two pairs of spots.
This character is only found in males.
In Bolivia the form with one spot occurs only in the focus of visceral leishmaniasis of Yungas (alt.
1,000-2,000 m) in peridomestic environment; it is the proven vector of that disease.
In Bolivia, so far, the two forms are allopatric and their ecology is quite different.

It underscores the centrality of the association "social policies/citizenship" withing democratic imagery, as fostered by the Welfare State.
Lastly, some reflections are offered on the current limits and possibilities of this equation under the advance of neo-liberalism.


Title
Notes on social policy.

Abstract
The most well-known types of Welfare States are first discussed, and it is seen that Brazil and Italy display the same social protection model.
Important differences in the arguments and proposals now on the agendas of both nations are then identified.
Inclusiveness and the representativity of the political system are taken as explicative variables in an analysis of the main roadblocks to a deeper transformation of the institutional mechanisms of social pulic_y iu Brazil.


Abstract
Using Michel Foucault's analysis of the types of power that make human beings subjects, the article considers the question of how a subject perceives himself as susceptible to being a subject-of-sickness.
The body made into subject by sickness is a concrete expression of how a relation of power is established.


Abstract
Contrary to what many suppose even today, societies organize and inter-vene in different moments of the sequence of the reproductive process, from the social organization of coitus, pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing the number and to child education.
Every moment of the reproductive sequence offers an opportunity for decision-making, management, and conflict.
The factors tliat govern the organization of these different moments are related to forms of social organization, the sexual division of labor, systems of representation, and, especially, conceptions regarding the forms of relations between the sexes.
Depending on the configuration of these factors at any given moment, we may even speak in terms of different systems or different models of reproduction.
The paper discusses some hypotheses on the construction of such models, as ideal types.

Abstract
Unlike their fellow Brazilians, social scientists in Europe and North America paid close attention to issues of blood donation and policy many years before the AIDS pandemic.
This article is partly an attempt to review such pioneering studies.
Among the most important contributions from the social sciences was Richard M. Titmuss's path-breaking study on The Gift Relationship (with the subtitle From Human Blood to Social Policy), published in England in 1971.


Abstract
Nonetheless, these practices displayed by the low-income population cannot be interpreted as advances in the social equality of the sexes.
On the contrary, they reveal a relation between the re-elaboration of class inequalities and gender inequalities.


Abstract
In the eighteenth century, primacy of science is stated as a new truth criterion.
Yet in the second half of the eighteenth century, hospital is medicalized.
Therefore, one coult undoubtedly say that a new management concerning life, death and reproduction is being asserted.


Abstract
Despite its reputation for openness to research on sexuality, anthropology as a discipline has only reluctantly supported such work.
Anthropological research and theory developed slowly, sharing a stable theoretical paradigm (the cultural influence model) from the 1920s to the 19908.
Moving beyond determinist and essentialist frameworks still common in biomedicine, anthropological work nevertheless viewed important aspects of sexuality as universal and transcultural.
Social construction theory has offered a challenge to tradit.ional anthropological models and has been responsible for a recent burst of innovative work in sexuality, both in anthropology and in other disciplines, since 1975.
The theoretical roots and implications of constructionist theory are explored.
The intensifymg competition between cultural influence and constructionist paradigms has been altered by the appearance of AIDS and the subsequent increased support to: research on sexuality.
On the one hand, the expansion in funding threatens to strengthen essentialist models in biomedical contexts and cultural influence models in anthropology.
On the other hand, the complexities and ambiguities inherent in the sexuality under study may both reveal the strengths of constructioriist approaches and spur the development of research and theory in anthropology.


Abstract
Focusing on artificial insemination by donor (AID), the article examines the social logic which underlies the principle of anonymity of the semen donor.
The central argument is that the strategy of disguising his identity, and other similar social devices, evince a two-folded aspect: on one hand, they convey an uneasiness anchored on the identification between family ties and biology/nature.
From this point of view, human will and/or culture are conceived as capable of manipulating and subordinating natural forces.
Based on this inherent duplicity of the social devices analyzed, the article suggests that they are expressive of a wider dilemma: the one of the tension in the way of conceiving the relative strength between nature over culture or culture over nature.


Abstract
This essay examines the development of research on sexuality in the wake of the HIV/AIOS epidemic.
Particularly within the field of public health, biomedical models and epidemiological concerns have guided the design of research activities, but have falled to provide data and analyses capable of contributing effectively to AIOS prevention.


Abstract
The growth of the use af contraceptive, of the number of women as head of families, and of their leveI of education, together with their impoverishment are combined to the poor estate in which the health in Brazil is.
With this article we intend to discuss the complexity of the relation between gender and power that permeates the sexual encounters between men and women, delimitating and shaping, among other things, the possibilities of safer sexual practices negotiation.


Abstract
By discussing one of the most relevant periods of this North American foundation performance in the country, this work tries to emphasize the importance of the subject to the historian.
In this sense, we cannot understand the formation of the medical carreer in Brazil without taking into account the creation of cientific carreers directed to the teaching, and research in the biomedical area by the Rockefeller Foundation.
We cannot understand the origins of health carreers in the country without considering ais o to the contribution of the Rockefeller foundation to the development of sanitary campaigns in national scale, and in the request for sanitarists of strong cientlfic forination.
The origins of the medical and sanita­rist profissionalization are strongly linked to the work of the Rockefeller Foundation in Brazil.

Title
Globalization and democratic governability.

Abstract
ln the beginning of the 90's, a wave of global optimism created a general conviction based on the idea that humanity had reached the top of universal peace, through the multiplication of democratic regimes and market economies.
To sum up, the article deals with the hypothesis that there is a growing contradiction in this end of century, between the process of globalization and democratic consolidation of the capitalist periphery.


Abstract
This work is aimed at knowing the impact which health concem has on food behavior.
Twenty one interviews with civil servants who work and have meal in downtown São Paulo were made.
The theoretical framework adopted was the concept of "social representation" defined by Moscovici.
The reports were organized by thematic categories involving the relations among eating, health and disease.
A circunstance dependent changeability in the used argumentation was observed, now more permissible with the food preferences, them more restrictive showing concernrnent with health.

Abstract
This essay aims at making a brief analysis of Wilhelm Reich, Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse's contributions which, in someway, helped to formulate a psychoanalytic theory of social perversion.


Abstract
A direct transcript of a conference given by the renowned British psychiatrist, Sir Aubrey Lewis, this article was originally published in a 1953 issue of the British Journal of Sociology.
The title may be slightly misleading, since the author is actually criticizing the social definition of health.
For instance, in dealing with the analyses of performance of psychological and physiological functions he ponders that there is no way we can objectively assess what is "an adequate performance of functions".
Hence, we cannot recognize a health or unsound body "in a reliable and valid way".
The essay is not as important because of the conclusions the author reaches - tentative and fragmentary - as it because of the questions he raises and the interpretations he challenges.


Abstract
The text examines the genesis of the Family Health Program, identifying the formulation and implementation strategies and progress indicators aiming at learning the lessons that may help improve Brazilian health policies.


Abstract
lt is imperative to understand the process of technological innovation in the health sector if we intend to act upon, and socially influence the development of new products in more desirable directions.
Despite the growing interest in innovation theories, knowledge of the factors that interact within the technical progress in the medical area is still scarce.
This article proposes the concepts of technological paradigm, technological trajectories and dominant design as a possible theoretical-methodological outline for examining the process of medical technology development.
This choice is based on the vision of multi-determination of the technical progress, recognizing the interactions of several fields of interest, such as market, scientific progress and public policies.


Abstract
This article examines the qualifications of people who work in the health area, within the context of the technological changes occurring in production restructuring and work organization processes.
In the first part, the authors discuss the changes in the field of work organization and their impact on the work process in the area of health, starting from the various studies made.
In the second part, the authors analyze the contradiction within the technology paradigm, from the perspective of qualifications and new skills.
In concluding, the article seeks to highlight the implications of this process in the field of human resources in health.

Abstract
This paper evaluates the work of the French philosopher G. Canguilhem on the relationship of the concepts of health, normality, disease and pathology.
Canguilhem's critique of the positivistic approach on the dichotomy normalpathological is considered unsatisfactory, because it reinforces the disjunction quantitative-qualitative.
The distinction between normality and health, as well as the conception of health as normative capacity, is analysed.


Abstract
This work aims at placing the health epistemology studies on the philosophy and experimental rationality history.


Abstract
As a leading political unity in the federation, though partly influenced by the modemization efforts of the federal authorities in the nation's capital, São Paulo had a unique role in the development of scientific careers, public health policies, and laboratory research in the country.

Abstract
Human complexity demands interlocution among di verse branches of knowledge.
Trying to establish a dialogue between Psychoanalysis and the cognitive sciences, the article focuses on consciousness, I and body as issues for discussion.
Based on Varela as his concept of enaction, it proposes a re-reading of the egoical genesis as indissociable from the body, emphasizing the pulsional dimension peculiar to the human being.


Abstract
This paper is an attempt to analyse formulations of the concept of femininity in the work of three authors in the realm of psychoanalysis: Monique Schneider, Joel Birman and Monique David-Ménard.
It aims at building up a new territory to think new forms of subjectivation in contemporary culture.
It starts with a critique of the dominant psychoanalytic interpretation of the theory of sexual difference - the phallus-castrated model - in the light of the changes in sexuality in the last 50 years.

It discusses the strategies of denying it as a product of the silence of the body that gets sick because of work.
The historical context of the concepts of body and disease, and the several views that, updated, will compose and decompose the movements of creation and/or crystallization of that territory.
Finally, the disease is pointed as the body's resistance to constraints.


Abstract
The study was led in collaboration with the mobile Unit of Research and Support in Palliative Care of the Central University Hospital - CUH of Grenoble in June and July 2005.
In addition to the direct observations, free conversations, participation in the meetings of medical units (transfers meetings, conciliation meetings...) the main method was the "understanding interview" carried out with 42 people: patients, members of the families, and medical units in two care units of CHU of Grenoble.


Abstract
By the change it causes, it permits to offer, at the same time, an attitude to untie disciplinary knowledges among them and a capacity of integrating the subject, his undiscipline and his interactions.
It drives you to a phenomenology of health by associating the ways of being and the ways of understanding.
The text aims to precise, in the field of health, different points raised by this paradigmatical change.


Abstract
During the last forty years, France has seen the birth of education as a scientific field (1967) and continuing education being formally recognized (1971 law).
These events came about through the labor involved in the development of the systemic approach, linkages between research, action and formation and, more recently, transdisciplinarity.
The author's career was propelled by these deliveries and by these socio-cognitive constructions, along with professional positions in research and formation.
In the first part, the author identifies and locates his personal uses of the systemic approach and of action research: different-surfacing period (1968-1980), paradigmatic linkages period (1980-1992) and, lastly, paradigmatic construction (1992-2005).
The second part presents a paradigmatic modeling.
This modeling confronts the positivist-pedagogical paradigm structuring traditional research in education to emerging new paradigmatic elements from original research-action-formation initiatives.
Finally, to open up the construction horizon, the term "anthropoformation" (human formation) is suggested to name this post-modern paradigm aiming at linking research, action and formation through a transdisciplinary systemic epistemology.

Abstract
This article aims to contribute to discussions about knowledge transfer between the West and Latin America, especially Mexico.
We seek to show the international and local efforts to foster the importation of germ theory during the 1880s.
Two examples are given as evidence of the political motivations of Mexican physicians in studying infectious diseases in that country.


Abstract
The profusion of theories within science and technological studies sometimes makes it hard to find lines of direction or stable points of support.
The question of the relations between scientific practices and the state affords an opportunity to appraise the differences between theoretical corpi.
The present article explores three recent theoretical propositions.
In the name of a neoliberal ideological foundation, the new production of knowledge has eliminated the notion of State from its conceptual horizon.
Actor-network theory, suspending the structures instituted within the chain of actors, ignores the state-form.
Lastly, regime of knowledge theory accords the state a special role as a source in managing the production of knowledge.


Abstract
The functional versatility of plants can be seen in their numerous uses by the people of Northern Cameroon.
They have implemented local know-how which has allowed them to effectively exploit their botanical environment.
The disappearance of valuable species has forced them to develop other strategies, with a new era marked by the consumption of manufactured products.


Abstract
The article shows that the conceptions and operational modalities of governance have changed over time and that they reveal tensions inherent to the transformation and legitimation process of public healthcare systems.
The first section discusses the relationships between reform and change.
The second section defines the conception of gouvernance used for the analisis.
Based on a content analisis of the various reform reports, the third section reveals the evolution of the conception of governance in healthcare systems in Canada.
In order to expose the new tendencies, ideologies and operational principles at the heart of the reform projects are analysed.
Five ideologies are identified: the democratic ideology, the "population health" ideology, the business ideology, the managerial ideology and the ideology of equity and humanism.
This leads to a discussion on the dominant influence of the managerial ideology in the current reform projects.


Abstract
A retrospective study of 91 patients admitted with femoral diaphyseal fractures at the Orthopedic Department of the "Juan Manuel Márquez" Pediatric Teaching Hospital between January, 1991, and December, 1994, was carried out.
67 % of the sample were male.
84 of the patients had closed fractures.

Abstract
The most frequent examinations performed were electromyogram, studies of sensitive, motor peripheral nervous conduction, and somatosensory evoked potentials.
In 98,0 % of patients, the studies conducted were consistent with the preliminary clinical diagnosis.
The level of coverage of Laboratory Service for hospitalized patients with diagnosis established by the above mentioned examinations was 69,3 %.
Electrophysiologic studies, besides being a diagnostic aid, allow for the follow-up of the clinical course of the diseases under treatment and for the evaluation of the results from therapeutic measures applied.

Abstract
This paper is the result of a multicenter investigation that served as a clinical assay for the validation of a bone densitometer (Degos 7032).
The study was based on the comparison of two groups of persons: one of the 50 apparently sound volonteers and the other of 39 patients with hip fracture.
To compare both groups it was used for the evaluation the F Fischer's test if the difference between the bone density variances (CMO-width) was significant in the distal extreme of the ratio by using the method of simple photon absorptiometry.
Then, another comparison was made by the t of Student test (for unmatched values).
The difference between the means was significant.
It was concluded that the bone density magnitude is an index that allow to differentiate both groups and that it may be used to monitor the hip fracture risk and to anticipate to the trauma caused by fracture.

Abstract
This paper is a report on the preliminary result of the clinical trial of the application of Dinamic Cephalic Containment Orthosis (DCCO) developed in our center for treating Leg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD).
26 hips from the l8 patients that were selected (10 unilateral and 8 bilateral) were studied.
The results showed a significant improvement of the symptoms and signs previous to the treatment in spite of the fact that 73 % had a severe affection and cephalic extrusion corresponding to degrees III (48 %) and IV (27 %) of Catterall’s classification.
According to the evaluation system used, the results were satisfactory in 80 %, which corresponded to class I (54 %) and class II (26 %) of Stulberg’s classification.
The best results were obtained at ages between 4 and 7, independently of the affectation and cephalic suffering.
The poor results (8 %) corresponded to patients over 8 with a severe degree of affectation.
The utilization of DOCC accelerated the evolutive process of LCPD and according to its preliminary results, it seems to be an efficient treatment.


Abstract
Orthopedics and Traumatology are among the first medical and surgical specialities demanding attention at the emergency services, which are a propitious setting for injured persons and for those suffering from a degenerative disease causing pain.
All the information was collected and processed at the statistics department of our hospital, according to the SPSS program, version 8.0 for Windows.
It was concluded that the classification of the patients at the emergency service by using the color code influenced on the reduction of the daily average of cases, with the subsequent decrease of the total number of cases attended during the analyzed period.
Besides, this helps to know in an inmediate way the fluctuations of morbidity.
Breaches are finally established to reduce even more the non urgent consultations (green codes) that produce an unjustified demand in these places.

Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease.

Abstract
Bearing in mind that Legg-Calvé-Perthes is an ischemic bone process and that oxygen is required for bone viability, cicatrization, and remodelling, it was determined to use hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of the disease to shorten time of natural development of the disease, to avoid surgery and other complications.
From the clinical, imaging and scintigraphic viewpoints, 210 patients aged 6 years as an average were studied.
Thirty five hyperbaric oxygen therapy sessions distributed into 3 cycles of 15, 10 and 10 sessions were administered at 7 week intervals, with 2 absolute atmosphere pressure and 50min isopressure time in a single chamber.
Healing time was under 24 months in 92 % of patients, 24 to 36 months in 5 % whereas 3 % did not recover after 36 months and the use of supplementary cycles.
It was underlined that 87 % of patients classified in Catteral III-IV recovered in less than 24 months and all those classified in Catteral I-II recovered, except for one who did after that period of time.
There was neither complication nor relapse.
In general, 87 % of the treated patients recovered.
It was concluded that this therapy substantially shortens the normal development time of the disease, leaves no sequel and avoids surgery, all of which results in economic, psychical and social benefits for the patients and their relatives.

Abstract
Low back pain is a problem characterized by its high prevalence in the population and by its great economic and social repercussions, since it has become one of the first causes of working absenteeism.
In low back pain, there is an association between muscular and psychosocial factors that generate avoidance conducts, fear and muscular atrophy, leading to a vicious circle that favors chronicity and disability.
About 90 % of the patients do not present any demonstrable injury, and that's why the problem is considered as an unspecific low back pain.
Contrary to what it was thought before, rest is contraindicated, since it debilitates and atrophies the back musculature.


Abstract
retrospective linear study was made for 4 years in a group of patients operated on from supracondylar fracture of the humerus in the Community Hospital of Araguaina in Brazil.
The results were compared with those of another group of patients operated on at "Comandante Pinares" General Teaching Hospital in San Cristóbal municipality, Pínar del Río province in a similar period of time.
Both studies were compared with another series of patients treated with closed reduction and a cast in a year.
Some of the results showed that suprachondyleal fracture of elbow in children when treated with surgery has not as good effect as that of the conservative treatment generally.
The complications going against recovery are rigidity or limited flexoextension of the elbow and the postsurgical infections infections both in soft parts and the bone.
Osteosynthesis with crossed percutaneous Kishner's wires is the technique of choice in closed fractures needing surgery.


Abstract
Pollicization of the index thumb through Buck-Gramcko technique is the classical treatment for aplasia and severe hipoplasia of the thumb.
This paper evaluated the efficacy of a modification introduced to Buck-Gramcko procedure.
A preliminary study was conducted in 8 patients diagnosed with hipoplasia or aplasia of the thumb and seen at "Frank Pais" orthopedic hospital from January 1st, 2004 to February 28th 2006.

The outcome was excellent in 4 hands, good in 4 hands and regular in one hand.


Abstract
Seventy four patients showed a pronounced lower subluxation of the shoulder.
It was concluded that the supraspinatus and the rotator cuff are the first motor of the glenohumeral articulation whereas the deltoid, being an extrinsical muscle associated to the glenohumeral articulation is a mere ancillary suspensory muscle.
The observations made in the control group no. 1 on isolated paralysis allowed stating that the biomechanical concept of the glenohumeral articulation constitutes a restriction to the fully understanding of the real function of the shoulder and an obstacle to the early diagnosis and the adequate treatment of the rotator cuff ruptures.


Abstract
After severe injures in the brachial plexus causing shoulder paralysis, reconstructive surgery is sometimes required to restore the previous function, so it is necessary to use several muscles to make the transfer.
Fifteen patients with shoulder injures were treated with Mayer´s technique to transfer the trapezius to the humerus.
The results showed 10 cases with good prognosis, 4 cases with regular prognosis and 1 with bad outcome.
Stabilized shoulder was possible in 14 patients.
The transfer of the trapezius provided a better function than arthrodesis in the shoulder paralysis.

Abstract
The use of topology optimization for the evaluation of total hip implants was presented.
To this end, two types of endoprostheses were compared, that is, the Lazcano type, the intrafemoral component (stem) of which is curved, and the straight stem.
Based on the evaluation of these two components, bone re-absorption and tissue density distribution after implantation was compared, allowing preliminary intrafemoral bone and intrafemoral component diagnosis, and the selection of appropriate implant.
The results of this numerical procedure lead to an estimation of the final bone density after hip implant that is comparable with the clinical practice patterns.
This process can better determine the best implant geometry, thus avoiding excessive bone mass loss.


Abstract
All fractures were of traumatic type (10) one was pathological.

Abstract
Bones are the specialized connective tissue shaping the main support organ of the body.
Long bone epiphysis underwent many structural changes during the perinatal period leading to formation of a secondary center of ossification (SCO), accounting for the epiphyseal spherical growth.
In present paper are exposed the characteristic biological changes of the different SCO development stages thorough a detailed description of histological events occurring in each stage and illustrating the processes coordination and the epiphyseal development pattern.
Therefore, present article will allows the understanding of such processes, creation of mathematical models of different events, as well as a theoretical basis for future papers researching the epiphyseal development and growth.


Abstract
In present paper it is supposed the lack of articular cartilage by chondrocytes death leading to a loss of extracellular matrix.
Given that the articular cartilage is avascular, chondrocytes viability may be one of the critical factors limiting the repair response.
Likewise, in the case of cartilage, tissue damage is produced by cellular death in presence of repeated loads in time.
Computation simulations were performed in agreement with clinical and experimental results obtained on cartilage damage.

Was operated on and we founded a fibrous and hard mass with a interior small cyst.
Sample was sended of anatomical and pathologic study diagnosing a type Antony A neurilemoma.
This is a uncommon case offering a brief review of medical literature on pathogeny, diagnosis and therapeutical guiding of this infrequent tumor.


Abstract
Patellofemoral instability is one of the more frequent diseases affecting this joint, specially in young patients.
Thus, a review on this subject was carried out to offer a general approach from the anatomical features of this joint.
The more significant elements of the biomechanics are showed including the articular geometry, alignment and behavior of ligaments and muscles.
The classic radiological signs are showed using the conventional X-rays divided into four groups or modalities according to the Dejour's classification as well as the significance of computerized axial tomography and the nuclear magnetic resonance.
To conclude, some treatment modalities are mentioned including the conservative one and those of surgical treatment are analyzed as well as its indications including the lateral retinaculum release, the medial imbrication, the distal re-alignment, trochlea plastic surgery and movement of tibial tuberosity towards a more medial and anterior zone.


Abstract
This is the case of a desmoplastic fibroma present in an adolescent aged 14.
A radiographic study was conducted showing an extensive osteolytic diaphysis and metaphyseal lesion in right femur.
The objective of present paper was to present a tumor with little statistic frequency in the national and international bibliography and also to show the procedure and definitive treatment.
The histological study corroborates the presence of abundant collagen fibers forming hyalinization strips separated by scarce small fibroblasts without mitosis activity.
Curettage of lesion was performed with insertion of surgical cement.
Patient had a satisfactory postsurgical course with an immediate incorporation to social environment.


Abstract
The objective of this communication is to show a uncommon case in the daily practice and the result of its treatment.


Abstract
Nuclear medicine is the medical specialty that deals with clinical diagnosis, treatment and research through the use of isotopes as open sources.
Bone diseases such as osteoporosis, primary bone cancer, bone metastases, arthrosis and arthritis are common among the population.
The objective of this review was to present international and national statistics, and evaluate the incidence of these disorders.
Additionally, a review was conducted of various clinical studies to identify the radiopharmaceuticals most frequently used to diagnose and treat bone disease, and their combination with the most common imaging techniques.
A presentation was made of the usefulness of bone gammagraphy and the confirmation of the disorders studied.
Reference was also made to the use of new techniques such as single photon emission tomography or positron emission tomography.
It was found that the radioisotope most commonly used to diagnose diseases of the bone system was 99mTc, due to its physical and chemical characteristics, whereas 186Re, 188Re, 153Sm, 177Lu, 32P, 89Sr, 85Sr, 117mSn are used for therapeutic purposes, depending on the type, location and magnitude of the lesions and the availability of the radioisotope.
At present, radiopharmaceutical development centers on combining these radioisotopes with various biomolecules to improve their properties and broaden their field of application.


Abstract
A work context on the modeling of endocondral formation process in any type of ossification present in the bones of the human body was shown.
It was concluded that the solution led to the denominated Turing patterns which represent these ossification processes in a highly estimated form.


Abstract
The negative impacts of the analytical investigations of infection were presented in the outpatient consultation after four months of evolution.
The modality of demanding sequential serial surgical debridement with continuous irrigation with 0.9 % physiological saline solution and a sensitive antibiotic to the microorganism gives satisfactory results.


Abstract
The objective is to assess the results of both rehabilitation and psychotherapy treatments.
It is concluded that the patient's condition improved an 80 % with the treatment, as well as her quality of life and her return to society.


Abstract
At present, some teenagers and young people in Cuba, in their desire to quickly increase the size of their muscles, are injecting soybean oil for domestic use, which has led them to serious injuries and even risk to their lives.
The aim of this work is to present this new condition, to show the characteristics of the lesions and spread the results for education and prevention.
We presented three cases on the adverse effects of oil injection into muscles in patients who were admitted to the Paediatric Hospital "Eliseo ¨Noel¨ Caamaño" of Matanzas from December 2010 to May 2011.
Their clinical features were a high increase in volume of the injected muscles, heat, redness, intense pain and functional impotence with general malaise.
The surgical treatment consisted on the incision, debridement and drainage which showed abundant oil, pus, blood and necrotic muscle fibres, procedure that had to be performed many times.
The lesions did not occur immediately, but with varying intervals and not in unison but in a disorganized form with great difficulty in healing.
Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotic was also used as well as hyperbaric chamber.
We conclude that the use of domestic oil provokes serious consequences to health such as sepsis and serious muscle necrosis, Hepatitis C, septicaemia and danger to the lives of those who use it.


Title
Injuries in ballet dancers

Abstract
Ballet is a sport that is being practiced frequently.
Dancers are exposed to sport injuries and have predisposing factors for them.
For that reason, we made a literature review to show a general approach of risk factors, incidence of injuries and their distribution in ballet dancers.
There are several risk factors for injuries such as arch movement, anatomic anomalies, dancing techniques, dancing discipline and postural stability.
About the 50 % of dancers present injuries each year and the majority of them are adolescents.
The most frequent ones occur as a result of overuse and are mainly located in the lower extremities.
We conclude that they need a special attention as occupational group, more information about risk factors and that there should be more possibilities to design prevention programs on this respect.


Abstract
Therefore, the aim of this work is to show the different factors that, acting on the osteomyoarticular system, lead to drops and cause these types of fractures and what to do to avoid them.


Abstract
It is concluded that, the exposure to those criminal acts will preventively contribute to avoid them when the implicated personnel lacks the necessary knowledge on this respect.


Abstract
Giant-cell tumors are a benign lesion, but their behavior may be locally aggressive.
After two months of rehabilitation, mobility and stability of the knee were normal.
The patient has fully reintegrated to his work and personal life.


Abstract
Charcot neuropathic arthropathy is very rare in children.
The present paper is mainly aimed at presenting the treatment applied to a child suffering from this disease.
Six months after diagnosis the ankle had been remodeled and the ulcers on the left foot had healed.


Abstract
Osteoarthritis is one of the main causes of pain and disability worldwide and fundamentally affects the knee, the hip and the hand joints.
The influence of physical activity in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is controversial.
The majority of experts recommend the non-pharmacological measures for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis such as aerobics, strengthening, aquatic exercises, and physical therapy for improved physical functioning, reduction of disability and pain relief.
It is necessary to determine more accurately the ideal prescription of exercises for the patients to obtain the best effects and to optimize the personalized management.
The adherence to exercising is important to achieve at short and at long term the best benefits from any type of exercises, and the preferences for performing them and the barriers to do it should be evaluated.
This article reviewed the general effects of exercising and of physical activity in the development, progression and treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis.


Abstract
The theoretical review of the hip arthoplasty in the acetabular variant is a controversial topic among the orthopedic surgeons.
The indications for the recovery of the bone reserve, particularly with structural allografts, remain under discussion.
It is widely accepted to use crushed bone allograft to treat cavity defects and the results have been good worldwide.
The use of a structural graft is more random and the results vary according to the scientific literature.
This paper will deal with the use of cephalic autograft taken from the femoral head of the patient.


Abstract
Calcaneal pseudoarthrosis is rare and its incidence accounts for 1.3% of all the intra-articular fractures.


Abstract
This article synthesises the main data of an inquiry led since 2007 in two of the peripheral social housing neighborhoods in Oporto that are more related with drug dealing and consumption.
Using the ethnographic method, we follow the evolution of the drug in the street' phenomenon, while the local community was adapting to a big eco-social event: the demolition of one of the neighborhoods, and the reaccommodation of part of its population in another quarter nearby.
From these empirical evidences, some of the dimensions that allow us to relate structural violence and daily violence were discussed, as well as the way the relations between drug, social exclusion and urban politics on drugs neighborhoods are usually equated.


Abstract
Crack is a psychoactive substance derived from cocaine paste.
It has a very high potential of addiction due to the peculiar combination of pharmacological and sociocultural effects implied in its use.
Facing the increase of the use of crack in Brazil, this article aims to contribute to the understanding of the daily life of crack users of downtown São Paulo known as Crackolandia.
The data presented were part of a doctoral dissertation, which adopted an ethnographic description to describe the users' profile, social patterns and the relationship between the drug use and self-care.
The data analysis of the field diary suggested a strong relationship between the social context and use pattern of crack.


Abstract
Illicit drug use is increasingly used by conventional citizens, as a form of diversion and to get pleasure.
Studies suggest that various drug users are conscious about drugs' potential harms but, taking into account their risks and benefits, decide to use them.
However, they do it with some care, using some drug use management strategies, in order to minimize potential harms.
The existence of drug users whose global adjustment is not significantly damaged by this practice is nowadays recognized.
Understanding these kinds of strategies may be an important contribution to reduce drug use potential harms and to enhance harm reduction efforts.


Abstract
It is undeniable that being diagnosed with a chronic disease sets numerous implications.
However, the diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) seems to have a particular impact on the person's life and relationships, especially if considering the stigma associated to it.
Being in touch with these individuals made us realize that, even when hospitalized due to complications related to hepatitis, they tend to blame the HIV instead of the Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC).
The qualitative methodology we applied meant to give this article an exploratory, descriptive and analytical outline of the experiences of 17 HIV/AIDS and CHC infected, to whom we gave voice to express their physical, psychological and social anguish.


Abstract
The alcoholism in its biopsychosocial complexity, is considered a multidimensional and polymorph problem in terms of pathological expression.
The application of instruments as MAST, permits the early diagnosis of excessive and dependent drinkers and allows the characterization of alcohol related problems when used under the structure of empirical classification.
The study aim to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of MAST (items and factorization study) in a clinical population of 202 alcohol dependents, observed in the alcoholism unit of the Psychiatric Service of Santa Maria´s General Hospital.
The factorial MAST, provides us with an assessment of deterioration areas of the individual, that when quantified and systematized, configure an instrument for early detection of pathological use of alcohol and an anamnestic empirical classification of the alcohol related problems heterogeneity.


Abstract
In this study the authors propose to evaluate and compare the prevalence and types of child abuse in a sample of 121 subjects addicts (61 men and 60 women) followed up in outpatient clinic at Centro das Taipas, and analyze the relationship between the bad abuse suffered in childhood and patterns of consumption of psychoactive substances, serology of the HIV and risk behaviors experienced throughout life.
They also indicate a significantly higher prevalence of HIV+ and suicide attempts in the group of women addicts.


Abstract
This study aims to contribute to the characterization of young users of psychoactive substances (PS) in a context of a great transformation in the phenomenon of drug use, both in our country and internationally.
We present data from an exploratory research that aims to contribute to the characterization of young consumers, pointing out some regularities in their life trajectories, using a biographical approach with in-depth interviews with a sample of 22 young people, gathered with a chain sampling (snowball).
Two groups were distinguished by their distance vs. proximity to problematic drug use patterns, designated here by former problematic trajectories in older consumers and non-problematic in new customers.
The results also demonstrated that these kids have a good family structure and are integrated in their community.
We highlight the lack of linearity in the relationship between the presence of transgressor behavior and consumption of PS as well as a strong association of the latter to recreational and peer group.


Abstract
A questionnaire was developed on the substance use; risk behaviors and criminal activity were also used: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Cut, Annoyed, Gilty; Eyer (CAGE), The Inventory of Drug-Taking Situation (IDTS), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the scale of social support.


Abstract
Since 1965, methadone is a cornerstone in the therapy of opiate and opioid addiction.
Among injecting drug users (IDU), individuals infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) constitute a vulnerable population.
Drug interactions may potentiate the toxic effects of drugs, reduce the effectiveness of HAART or trigger symptoms of opiate withdrawal, with subsequent relapse in opiate use and lower adherence to care and treatment regimens.
The aim of this article is to present a literature's review about drug interactions between methadone and antiretroviral drugs.


Abstract
The article presents the program TRILHOS - Developing personal and social skills and the discussion on the evaluation methodology.


Abstract
This article presents the evaluation findings of three drug addiction prevention projects, integrated in Programa Intervir - municipal program for the drug addiction prevention in the city of Lisbon.
The data point to strategies to improve the efficacy and the efficiency of drug addiction prevention programs.


Abstract
This article proposes a confrontation between two visions about the addict: the one that is conveyed by the stereotypical hooked user, and the phenomenological one, proposed here from the ethnographic access to his experience.
We begin by characterizing two types of thinking: the objectified and the constructivist, as ways to look at reality and explaining it, discussing the differences and similarities between common sense and science.
Then we make a brief characterization of the concept of stereotype, in order to establish a theoretical framework for the exercise that will occupy the rest of the article.
This exercise examines certain dimensions like the relationship between the figure of the hooked and the context of social exclusion, the notion of temporality or the ability/inability to achieve abstinence.
Our conclusion is that we must not correct the stereotype of the hooked in the context of a more rigorous science, but, instead, to demonstrate how, between the two, there is a mutual feedback.
The language we speak when adressing drug issues is the product fo a social constructrion in which we highlight the roles of common sense, the media and science, particularly the one that fits its production in the medico-psychological realm.


Abstract
Co-morbidity or dual diagnosis is established by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the co-occurrence in the same individual of a dysfunction of psychoactive substance use and other psychiatric disorder' (WHO, 1995).
Resulting from this observation and the need felt in clinical practice, the Regional Delegation of the Alentejo proposed a group of psychologists to study the drug addicts of the Alentejo treatment centers, assessing briefly the coexistence of psychopathology, in order to improve the quality and appropriateness of the clinical intervention.
We used the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) L. R. Derogatis, with the Portuguese adaptation (M. R. Canavarro).


Abstract
Teenagers who abuse alcohol sometimes have associated psychopathology.
Psychiatric Disorder may precipitate Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) or result from the consumption of alcohol.
Furthermore, the AUD and psychopathology can exist independently in high-risk adolescents, because they share some triggers.
The psychiatric disorders more often associated to alcohol use in adolescents are conduct disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety Disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a relationship between alcohol consumption and the presence of psychopathology in a school sample (236).
As the use of alcohol in adolescence can have long-term consequences, the identification of risk factors for use and abuse of alcohol by adolescents is central to the development of effective prevention programs.


Abstract
The treatment related to the drug addition is a slow and complex process where the social-professional integration assumes a cen­tral role.
The work relation has a strategical dimension that facilitates a set of acquisitions regarding the autonomy of the drug addicts in treatment.
The organizations and the business appear as an essentialpartnerin this process.
Without its involvement and participation, all the progresses reached during the treatment previous phases are fruitless.
In the case study, through qualitative and quantitative research, it was identified, more profoundly, the relation between the type of work organization and the possibilities of success of interventions targeted to the recovery and social-professional integration of former drug addicts.
It follows that the success or the failure of these interventions take place in differentiated organizational contexts, and it is clear that the figure of mediation is the most decisive variable, through all the inte­gration process, choosing and preparing the employers who hire the drug addicts in treatment.


Abstract
The Integrated Plan of Drug Addiction Prevention (PIPT), funded by the Institute of Drugs and Drug Addiction (IDT) and the Municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, is currently sponsored by the Association for the Promotion of Health and Community Development (APSDC), and has already 10 years of experience in the field of prevention and treatment of drug addiction in Vila Franca de Xira (region of the metropolitan area of Lisbon).
This Plan comes in the context of the first national strategy against drugs and was considered a pioneer and innovative response in this domain, and is currently part of the Integrated Res­ponse Program of the IDT.
This article attempts to make a retrospec­tive about the history of this integrated experience, and to present the objectives, main lines of action and achieved results, hoping further to contribute to a reflexion about the strengths and constraints of the integrated intervention policies and practices.


Abstract
In this article, we analyse social work practices in the domain of harm reduction policies, taking as empirical subject the practice of social workers inserted in harm reduction programs among illicit drug users in the Oporto Metropolitan Area.
The results suggest a professional practice guided for a conception of harm reduction as public health measure supported by the principles of tolerance and citizenship, aiming the reduction of individual harm in order to prevent collective risks.
We concluded that the social work practices oscillate between the regulation of «psychoactive risks» and the obligation with the efectivation of the citizenship rights, through a relation with the users of illicit drugs ruled by the defense of the human dignity and protection of the right to have health.


Abstract
The psychological aggressions in the work (exhaustions, harassments, stress, violence) have become one of the subjects of greater preoccupation in the prevention of professional risks.


Abstract
The so called clinic short crowns and/or those dental pathological processes whose limits can be subgingivalor even underosseous, are a frenquent problem in dental office.
Diferent causes produce them, being the most frequent: decay, dental fractures and altered passive eruption.
The reasons for their treatment are usually prostodontics and/or restorative dentistry although very often, our patients come to us for esthetical reasons.
The surgical technique leading to their correction is called "crown lengthening technique".
In this article we will analize the morphological and biological principIes which rule their justification, their limits, as well as the own surgical handlings we must carry out.


Abstract
There is realized a brief description of the physiology of both molecules and his application is valued to the concept of bioactive surface in implantology.


Abstract
After summarizing the historical background and development of former hospices, the author analyses the philosophy that has inspired Palliative Medicine from its selfsame origins up to the present in different countries in the world.
The apparent paradox that supposes to find life and joy amidst death and suffering explains the peculiar ethos that guides teamwork, an ethos grounded on practical humane compassion.
The connecting theme of the work is the necessity of providing terminal patients with an interdisciplinary professional accompaniment -highly qualified and personalized- intended to consider the totality of patients' and families' human dimensions


Abstract
Domiciliary assistance in the context of Palliative Care demands a coordinated action between the regional health system, hospitalizing institutions and home care team.
Basic requisites must be complied with when considering the patient’s staying at home, playing a major role in this setting, the family and the social environment.
Some factors implying an unsatisfactory home health care are described: inappropriate home-hospital transition; insufficient pain and other symptoms relief; poor communication and inadequate family support.


Abstract
By starting with a reflection about the different meanings ascribed to the so-called "right to die with dignity", this work analyses the response given by Palliative Medicine to the end-of-life debate.
After reviewing available statistics from Holland -first country in legalizing euthanasia- the author explains the solution that Palliative Medicine has proposed to the issue of "death with dignity".
It is necessary to perceive the act of dying as a "human act" in order to understand that response adequately.
In this context five moral principles are mentioned, viewed as relevant for safeguarding the ethical dimension of dying.
They are: the principles of veracity, therapeutical proportionality, double-effect, prevention and not-abandon.
The paper ends with an invitation to change the present medical paradigm, shifting from a medicine controlled by the logic of the "technological imperative" towards a "personalized medicine"


Abstract
Suicide can be understood only as a result of a previous reflection about death.
With reference to some texts by Hegel, Goethe and Heidegger, the author proposes a conception of death, not only as a part of life but also as 'that' that gives meaning to it.
A similar idea, though expressed in a very original way, is the one sustained by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke in a letter to his editor in Polish, W. Hulewicz, of November 13, 1925.
The author tries to study more deeply the poet's thought concerning death, through the analysis of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Duino Elegies (1922), poems where Rilke develops his concept of the "personal death", announced in his novel, The notes of Malte Laurids Brigge (1910).
To him, life itself consists of "learning to die", of preparing in advance "the masterpiece of a noble death..., of a consummate, happy and enthusiastic death, as only saints were able to conceive it".
Then, the question is what could happen to induce someone not to wait for his /her own death and destroy with a suicidal act the harmony of life and death?.
The poet gives the answer in the Requiem for Wolf von Kalckreuth (1908).
The one committing suicide does not recognize in earth the possibility of joy, as something that, sometimes, is hidden amid pain.
Secondly, the suicide hurries to give life and death a definitive interpretation, without allowing life -in its own way- to unveil the meaning of the existence.
Finally, Rilke's suicidal young, who happened to be a poet, did not let his work mature, perhaps he did not understand what was the essence of poetry: that the poet transforms himself in the words that eternalize things


Abstract
This shift in the doctrine of fundamental rights translates into practical consequences in a variety of issues related to the regulation of these reproductive techniques ( embryo cryopreservation, germ cells donors, posthumous reproduction, informed consent, and so forth)


Abstract
By so doing, we pretend to surpass in a legitimate way the totality of difficulties caused by the tension and discontinuity between cognitive and moral developments in two significant areas: health and environment.


Abstract
The following text shows us the reflections made by Jean Ladrière concerning the sense and meaning of bioethics in the context of what is known today as the growth of "applied ethics".
From the first considerations he refuses accepting the idea that "regional ethics" limits itself to translate -into the sphere of concrete situations- general principles, since this would be equivalent to ignore creativity, innovative possibilities and the risks involved in the action in its permanent determination of existence.
Establishing the need of inaugurating reflections concerning proposed themes -from the space filled and legitimized by bioethical drive- he attempts to show the complicity between bioethics and ethics, as well as to puzzle out the specific way in which bioethics respond to the demands of producing regulations, that in particular are consequence of the challenges of human and techno-scientific actioning.
Jean Lardrière's argumentation briefly explains issues addressed throughout his research and which may seem too hermetic to the unprepared reader.
The subject of techno-science was analyzed by Jean Ladrière in his book Les enjeux de la rationalite (1977) and in many other publications; the issue of existence and its relationship with the sense in L'articulation du sens (1971, volume 1; 1985, volume 2), and the topic of ethics and the ethical dimension of existence in L'ethique dans l' univers de la rationalité (1997).
It is relevant pointing out that as translator of this text, I tried to use Spanish issues of some of the authors quoted but in front of differences related to certain terms -showing disparity of interpretation- I decided to translate them directly from Jean Ladrière's text


Abstract
This paper presents an approach to the process of valoric construction based on natural language, as characteristic of the world of life.
It si suggested that this language reflects explicit and implicit anthropological conceptions within a given community.
This does not imply moral relativism but it points out the need to contextualize precepts and principles and to empirically study the forms in which dilemmas are articulated and solutions proposed.
Some lines of development for a language-based empirical axiography are proposed as a legitimate component of social studies in bioethics


Abstract
In this context, the contents of the principles of the Universal Declaration of the UNESCO concerning the human genome, acquire great importance.
By warning that legal regulations can inefficiently solve some biogenetic problems, the author first addresses the concept of "human genome: mankind's common heritage".
The author analyses the following "leading principles": a) The principle of dignity and inviolability of the individual, throughout a strict respect for human rights. b) The principle of non-commercialization of human body. c) The principle of non- discrimination. d) The principle of confidentiality. e) The principle of free and informed consent


Abstract
As a next step, the author analyses the determining elements of the euthanistic behavior, always considered from a penal perspective.
Finally, the ethical and legal feasibility of a legislation properly euthanistic will be analysed in the light of the principle of human dignity , explicitly or implicitly recognized by the main international instruments and by all the political codes of the social and democratic States of right


Abstract
This article proposes the concepts of legality and legitimacy to the ethical analysis of medical publications.
Legality refers to the compliance with procedures accepted by the scientific community related to validity, reliability, and solvency of the research work.
Legitimacy alludes to the properness with which ethical principles are dealt with within the contents of the publication.
This analysis is especially relevant in studies concerning human subjects, but it is not restricted to them.
Together with emphasizing the scientific editor’s role as "gatekeeper" of legality and legitimacy, a taxonomy of scientific publications in terms of its character, style and audience is proposed.
The importance of bioethical examining of publication practices lies in that they reflect the condition of medical discipline, the social respect and the possibility of maintaining it.
The fact that written regulations reflect aspirations and suggestions is underlined, and accordingly, it is deemed as erroneous to conceive them as mandatory.
Safeguarding of the ethical nature of the publications can only be made possible by educating researchers on their commitments and obligations


Abstract
In the presence of the problems posed by new technologies, traditional medical ethics is not able to respond satisfactorily.
At the present time, research and biotechnological experimental applications are more and more numerous and artificial, following a desire and a constancy that ignores limits and whose unbalanced condition or meta-stability constitutes its unique and tireless motive.
The search for knowledge vanishes in front of the implacable "logic of efficacy".
This problem becomes worse because present biological revolution (Bernard), in contrast to therapeutical revolution -which affected the medical practice related to the individual- affects humanity as a species.
But, wouldn’t the control of scientific activities be equivalent to restrict the acquisition of fundamental knowledge?
To new domains correspond new responsibilities.
Opposite to the old humanism founded on finality and paternalism, a new humanism appeals to responsibility.
Thus, the "principle of responsibility" (Hans Jonas) has an ethical sense only when each individual discovers himself as author, in one sense or the other, of long-range changes and of forces he does not control.
In a time in which science has become more operative, active and manipulative -that is to say where knowledge is also power and acting- philosophical thinking has to be directed to a new Practical Reason


Abstract
This paper consists in a particularised analysis of the Declaration of Helsinki, revised at the 52nd WMA General Assembly at Edinburgh in October 2000.
The phrases and paragraphs analysed are identified by means of different printing characters for the modified and new pieces, and the English version.
The analysis was made from a bioethical perspective, especially regarding Human Rights concerns, as well as considering the scientific issues of medical research, including the viewpoint of Evidence based Medicine.


Abstract
Violence is still on the increase even though the world is no longer divided.


Abstract
At the beginning of the 19th century, the estimated world population was 978 millions.
In more developed regions the proportion of people older than 60 was around 20%.
Population in Latin America and the Caribbean will grow approximately 180 millions within 2000 and 2025.
More than one third of that growth will correspond to old age people.
The transformation of the structure by ages results in particular social, economic, and political demands.
At the same time the social-demographic differences, particularly the age structure, emphasize the difference in the treatment of bioethical issues.
Ageing appears in the more advanced transitional countries of the Region, as a linked phenomenon, on the one hand by the increasing proportion of senior citizens, and on the other, by the improved quality of life in the old age years.


Abstract
Bioethical discourse, as it relates to common experiences of older people, has tended to focus on conflictive issues as they arise in long-term care.
Many good changes in long-term care have come as the result of these efforts.
It will challenge the dominance of existing values and so leave new spaces for ethical action.


Abstract
The increase of senior citizens in last decades and the greater longevity of the population will bring a high demand for services in the final stages of life.
There is a close association between ageing-as a process that intersects what is biological, social and biographical-and death, that actually can not be separated from culture.
Old age is a stage of loss and reduced capability.
Dialogue is the most important tool with which bioethical discourse has contributed to modern societies.


Abstract
Currently, Chile has a free market development model, which has been maintained within the last decade through some adjustments intended to correct different social imbalances.
Capitalism without state intervention cannot be sustained in democratic countries.
Old age and ageing are addressed within this context.
The issue is approached from an individual and social angle, under a multidisciplinary point of view.
The images, which present society has regarding old age, refer to cultural patterns which hardly recognize that ageing is a unavoidable situation for human beings.
Ageing is perceived and transmitted as a painful situation, biased by images of old people: ill, disabled, suffering emotional disorders, and representing an emotional and economic burden on their families.
The concept of "quality of life" considers subjectivity as an essential element, therefore expectations are above all individual.
Likewise it has a multidimensional and complex character, produced by diversity.
It is also a dynamic concept, as it varies with time.
Groups in reduced social and economic conditions tend commonly to share their homes with their elders, being these not only their parents, but also relatives, or even some not related by kinship.
Political participation is oriented to influence those decisions which compromise the destiny of the collectivity as a whole.
The social participation concerns those closest to the development of the daily life of the individuals.
Even though senior citizens constitute a relevant electoral market with growing importance, its role as political actors is still irrelevant


Abstract
Besides facing aging myself, I work mainly with rural hospitals and nursing homes and hospice organizations where most of the patients are elderly.
His iceberg metaphor highlights the danger of global aging and the fact the all human beings are exposed to this danger


Abstract
The elderly present a high prevalence of chronic diseases which translates into a greater demand for health assistance.


Abstract
It is evident that discrimination due to age does not act in isolation but in conjunction with other factors, thus increasing the risk of vulnerability and discrimination.
It is the case, for instance, of health, gender and economic inequalities associated to discrimination by reason of age.


Title
BIOETHICAL EVALUATION OF RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS PUBLISHED IN LATIN AMERICAN AND THE CARIBBEAN.

Abstract
The explicit mention of bioethical requirements in biomedical publications involving human subjects and the inclusion of ethical criteria in the evaluation of scientific papers were investigated in a sample of journals from the Latin American and Caribbean Region.
Through a selection criterion based on the indexation in databases MEDLINE and LILACS, access to complete texts and guidelines for contributors, among others, 41 scientific journals were identified, out of which 625 articles were reviewed.
The results differ for drug trials (177 articles) or diagnostic clinical studies or non pharmacological treatment (448).
A greater concern for ethical aspects was evident among the former (49% indicate informed consent and 46% review by ethics committee) than in the latter (32% indicate obtaining consent and 27% review by ethics committee).
Also, a greater compliance with ethical regulations is observed in clinical trials phase II and III than in phase IV.
The analysis of guidelines for constributors shows that in the reviewed journals editors' greatest concern refers to informed consent in the journals indexed in MEDLINE (50% asks for this requirement) and the approval by the ethics committees in the ones indexed in LILACS (in 43% it is requested).
In general, the explicit compliance with ethical requirements reaches at the most 50% and there are no ethical references in almost 45% of the publications


Abstract
The conception that social representations operate in network, is not new for social psychology.
Understood as a form of social thought firmly anchored in the ideological universe of societies, social representations shared not only aspects of their content but also their internal organization.
A mutual interdependence or involvement is one of the theoretical and methodological sign evidenced in this theoretical field of social psychology.
This article, in addition of the submission of several papers on the same matter, illustrates this psychological reality with empirical results conducted through the analysis of press material about two objects of representation: human rights and migration.
Social representation theory is placed in the field of social politics psychology.

Abstract
BACKGROUD
Suicidal behaviour is a leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide and varies widely between countries.

RESULTS
The total number of suicides in Durban increased by 6.68% from 2006 to 2007.
Suicide accounted for an average of 8.8% of all non-natural deaths per year of the study.
The overall suicide rates of 14.53 (2006) and 15.53 (2007) per 100 000 population are comparable with national and global figures.
The majority of suicides occurred in single unemployed persons, men and younger age groups.
The largest number of suicides per year was recorded in black people, followed by Indian, white and mixed-race people.
Hanging was the preferred method in the majority of victims, followed by self-poisoning, shooting and jumping.


Abstract
BACKGROUD
These pregnancies are mostly unplanned and unintended and many are terminated, either legally or illegally.

RESULTS
The study revealed that there was a high percentage (78.3%) of unwanted pregnancies amongst those engaging in sex.
Significantly, nearly half (43.3%) of these unwanted pregnancies resulted in abortion.
Only 10% of the students sampled admitted to ever having used emergency contraception.

Abstract
BACKGROUD

RESULTS
Of the 384 women recruited, a majority (46.1%) were in the 31-40 year age group; 52% had reached primary school and 88% did not have formal employment.
There was variation in the duration of contraceptive use and the main reason for using contraception was to space children.
Of the participants, 20.7% had been using contraception for more than two years.
Seventy-seven (31.5%) of the women reported they did not use contraception because of a fear of side effects.


Abstract
This is the first in a series of articles on primary care research in the African context.
The aim of the series is to help build capacity for primary care research amongst the emerging departments of family medicine and primary care on the continent.
Many of the departments are developing Masters of Medicine programmes in Family Medicine and their students will all be required to complete research studies as part of their degree.
This series is being written with this audience in particular in mind - both the students who must conceptualise and implement a research project as well as their supervisors who must assist them.
This article gives an overview of the African primary care context, followed by a typology of primary care research.
The article then goes on to assist the reader with choosing a topic and defining their research question.
Finally the article addresses the structure and contents of a research proposal and the ethical issues that should be considered.

This article is part of a series on Primary Care Research in the African context and focuses on programme evaluation.
Different types of programme evaluation are outlined: developmental, process, outcome and impact.
Eight steps to follow in designing your programme evaluation are then described in some detail: engage stakeholders; establish what is known; describe the programme; define the evaluation and select a study design; define the indicators; plan and manage data collection and analysis; make judgements and recommendations; and disseminate the findings.
Other articles in the series cover related topics such as writing your research proposal, performing a literature review, conducting surveys with questionnaires, qualitative interviewing and approaches to quantitative and qualitative data analysis.


Abstract
Presenting a research report is an important way of demonstrating one's ability to conduct research and is a requirement of most research-based degrees.
Although known by various names across academic institutions, the structure required is mostly very similar, being based on the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion format of scientific articles.
This article offers some guidance on the process of writing, aimed at helping readers to start and to continue their writing; and to assist them in presenting a report that is received positively by their readers, including examiners.
It also details the typical components of the research report, providing some guidelines for each, as well as the pitfalls to avoid.
This article is part of a series on African Primary Care Research that aims to build capacity for research particularly at a Master's level.


METHODS
Samples of drinking-water and water from a tube-well were tested for coliform organisms.

FINDINGS
Most of the children (26/36) were from the Gurgaon district in Haryana or had visited Gurgaon town for treatment of a minor illness.
Acute renal failure developed after an episode of acute febrile illness with or without watery diarrhoea or mild respiratory symptoms for which the children had been treated with unknown medicines by private medical practitioners.
On admission to hospital the children were not dehydrated.
Kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis.
Thirty-three children were known to have died despite being treated with peritoneal dialysis and supportive therapy.

CONCLUSION
Thus, poisoning with diethylene glycol seems to be the cause of acute renal failure in these children.


METHODS
From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, active surveillance for meningitis was conducted in six regions.
For children with suspected meningitis, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen was sent for cytology, chemistry, latex agglutination testing, culture and sensitivity.

FINDINGS
During the 2.5-year study period, surveillance was conducted among 138 249 children aged <5 years - a sample representing 40% of all Bulgarian children in this age group.
Overall, 285 children with suspected meningitis were identified.
In eight children, clinical symptoms of meningitis resolved rapidly before a CSF specimen could be obtained.
Of the remaining 277 children, 121 (44%) were classified as having probable bacterial meningitis on the basis of a CSF examination.
An organism was identified for 88 (73%) of the 121 cases with probable bacterial meningitis.
There were 21 cases of Hib, giving a mean annual incidence of 6.1 Hib meningitis cases per 100 000 children <5 years; the case-fatality rate was 10%.
Nearly 60% of Hib isolates were resistant to one or more antibiotics, but they were not resistant to third-generation cephalosporins.

CONCLUSION
On the basis of these findings, Hib conjugate vaccines have been included in the list of vaccines recommended for children by the Bulgarian Ministry of Health.
The recommended initial treatment for paediatric bacterial meningitis has been changed to third-generation cephalosporins.


METHODS
Scenarios for assessing the impact of the elimination strategy were implemented in a computer simulation program.
The scenarios reflected the assumptions made regarding contagiousness, transmission and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination.

FINDINGS
The annual decline was a few per cent higher when favourable assumptions were made about protection and coverage of BCG vaccination.

CONCLUSION
The elimination strategy reduces transmission, but the decline may be slow.
A long-term strategy for leprosy control should be adopted.


OBJECTIVE
Rubella vaccine is not included in the immunization schedule in Myanmar.
Therefore, we organized a study to assess the burden of CRS.

METHODS
From 1 December 2000 to 31 December 2002 active surveillance for CRS was conducted among children aged 0-17 months at 13 hospitals and 2 private clinics in Yangon, the capital city.
Children with suspected CRS had a standard examination and a blood sample was obtained.
All serum samples were tested for rubella-specific IgM; selected samples were tested for rubella-specific IgG and for rubella RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

FINDINGS
During 2001-02 no rubella outbreaks were detected in Yangon Division.
In the 31 urban townships of Yangon Division, the annual incidence was 0.1 laboratory-confirmed cases of CRS per 1000 live births.

CONCLUSION
This is the first population-based study of CRS incidence from a developing country during a rubella-endemic period; the incidence of CRS is similar to endemic rates found in industrialized countries during the pre-vaccine era.
Rubella-specific IgG tests proved practical for diagnosing CRS in children aged > 6 months.


OBJECTIVE
In September 2006, a Panamanian physician reported an unusual number of patients with unexplained acute renal failure frequently accompanied by severe neurological dysfunction.
Twelve (57%) of 21 patients had died of the illness.
This paper describes the investigation into the cause of the illness and the source of the outbreak.

METHODS
Case-control and laboratory investigations were implemented.
Questionnaire and biological data were collected.
The main outcome measure was the odds of ingesting prescription cough syrup in cases and controls.

FINDINGS
Forty-two case patients and 140 control patients participated.
The median age of cases was 68 years (range: 25-91 years); 64% were male.
After controlling for pre-existing hypertension and renal disease and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, a significant association was found between ingestion of prescription cough syrup and illness onset (adjusted odds ratio: 31.0, 95% confidence interval: 6.93-138).
Laboratory analyses confirmed the presence of diethylene glycol (DEG) in biological samples from case patients, 8% DEG contamination in cough syrup samples and 22% contamination in the glycerin used to prepare the cough syrup.

CONCLUSION
The source of the outbreak was DEG-contaminated cough syrup.


METHODS
Personal, equipment and environmental risk factors were identified from hospital records.

FINDINGS
The incidence of burn admissions among 0-14 year-olds increased from 85 to 96 per 100 000 between 1996 and 2006, mainly due to a 13% increase among 1-4 year-olds.
Between 1993-2000 and 2006, the proportion of burn victims in the country hospitalized at the Prague Burn Centre increased from 9% to 21%.
Detailed data were available on 1064 children (64% boys).
Around 31% of all burn hospitalizations were in 1 year-olds.
Some 79% of burns occurred at home: 70% in the kitchen, 14% in the living room or bedroom and 11% in the bathroom.
Of the 18% occurring outdoors, 80% involved boys.
Scalds from hot liquids accounted for 70% of all burns.
The mean hospital stay was 22 days for boys and 18 days for girls.

CONCLUSION
There is a need for passive preventive measures, such as redesigned domestic cooking and eating areas, safer electrical kettles and temperature control devices for bathrooms.
Educational programmes should be developed for parents and caregivers.
A national plan for child burn prevention with specific targets would be helpful.


METHODS
We used informant networks to characterize all maternal deaths, and a capture-recapture method to estimate the total number of maternal deaths.
Through a survey of recent births we counted all midwives practising in the two study districts.

FINDINGS
The overall maternal mortality ratio was 435 per 100 000 live births (95% confidence interval, CI: 376-498).
This is perhaps because the women, especially poor ones, may have sought help only once a serious complication had arisen.

CONCLUSION
Achieving equitable coverage of all births by health professionals is still a distant goal in Indonesia, but even among women who receive professional care, maternal mortality ratios remain surprisingly high.
This may reflect the limitations of home-based care.


METHODS
This was a retrospective study of measles cases and deaths in Nepal.
Through two-stage random sampling, we selected 37 districts with selection probability proportional to the number of districts in each region, and then randomly selected within each district one outbreak among all those that had occurred between 1 March and 1 September 2004.
Cases were identified by interviewing a member of each and every household and tracing contacts.
Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors for a high CFR and determine the time from rash onset until death.
Each factor's contribution to the CFR was determined through multivariate logistic regression.
From the number of measles cases and deaths found in the study we calculated the total number of measles cases and deaths for all of Nepal during the study period and in 2004.

FINDINGS
We identified 4657 measles cases and 64 deaths in the study period and area.
This yielded a total of about 82 000 cases and 900 deaths for all outbreaks in 2004 and a national CFR of 1.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.5-2.3).
CFR ranged from 0.1% in the eastern region to 3.4% in the mid-western region and was highest in politically insecure areas, in the Ganges plains and among cases < 5 years of age.
Vitamin A treatment and measles immunization were protective.
Most deaths occurred during the first week of illness.

CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, this is the first CFR study based on a nationally representative sample of measles outbreaks.
Routine surveillance and studies of a single outbreak may not yield an accurate nCFR.
Increased fatalities associated with political insecurity are a challenge for health-care service delivery.


Title
Diabetes treatment and control: the effect of public health insurance for the poor in Mexico.

METHODS
Standard propensity score matching was used to create a highly comparable control group.

FINDINGS
Very poor glucose control (HbA1c > 12%) was found in a significantly smaller proportion of adults in the insured group than in the uninsured group (by a difference of 17.5 percentage points; 95% CI: 6.5-28.5).


METHODS
We conducted a trilingual search (English, French, Portuguese) of LexisNexis® with the phrase "male circumcision" for the period from 28 March 2007 to 30 June 2008.
We judged the accuracy of the reports and determined the context, public perceptions, misconceptions and areas of missing information in the print media.
We also explored whether the media could be better used to maximize the impact of male circumcision.

FINDINGS
We identified 412 articles, of which 219 were unique and 193 were repeats.
"Peaks and valleys" occurred in the volume of articles over time.
Most articles (56.0%) presented male circumcision for the prevention of HIV infection in a positive light.
Those that portrayed it negatively had an overall repeat rate 2.9 times higher than positive articles.
Public health messages formulated by international health agencies were few but generally accurate.

CONCLUSION
The accuracy of the reports was good, although the articles were few and frequently omitted important messages.
This suggests that public health authorities must help the media understand important issues.


OBJECTIVE
Also, to explore interrelations between these factors and age, sex, education and income.

METHODS
A sample of 238 individuals was randomly recruited from low-income housing districts near Cape Town, South Africa in 2007.
Trained research assistants interviewed participants to explore their knowledge about paraffin-related safety and their perceived risk of injury from using paraffin.
Researchers inspected participants' homes to evaluate paraffin safety practices.
Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted.

FINDINGS
Participants had relatively low levels of knowledge about paraffin-related safety.
Knowledge of paraffin safety and safe practices were positively correlated with each other.
Greater knowledge showed a negative correlation with the perception of being at risk for injury, but safe practices showed no correlation with perceived risk of injury.


METHODS
Oxygen cylinders and concentrators were compared in terms of functionality and cost.
An algorithm and a software tool to guide the choice of oxygen delivery system were constructed.

FINDINGS
Cylinder costs are greatly influenced by leakage, which is common, whereas concentrator costs are affected by the cost of power far more than by capital costs.

CONCLUSION
Neither concentrators nor cylinders are well suited to every situation, but a simple options assessment can determine which is better in each setting.
The decision algorithm and software tool designed for the Gambia could be applied in other developing countries.


METHODS
We used a stratified three-stage cluster sample of 13 988 adults aged 18 years and older from all provinces in 2005-2006.

FINDINGS
Cigarette smoking occurred among 48.0% of men and 3.6% of women.
We estimated that 560 482 women (95% confidence interval, CI: 504 783 to 616 180) currently chewed tobacco (typically as a component of betel quid) and that the prevalence more than doubles with each decade of adulthood up to the point that about half of all older women chew tobacco.
Both men and women cited the influence of older relatives as their primary reason for starting to use tobacco.
About one out of five rural women who used chewing tobacco started their habit for relief from morning sickness.
The highest prevalence of chewing tobacco among women was seen among midwives (67.9%) and traditional healers (47.2%).
High rates (66.8%) of cigarette and pipe tobacco use occurred among ethnic minorities who represent hill tribes found throughout south-east Asia.

CONCLUSION
The tobacco epidemic in Cambodia extends far beyond cigarette smoking in men.


METHODS
We used field survey data sets covering a contiguous area 2750 × 850 km and including 26 790 school-age children (5-14 years old) in 418 schools.
The prevalence of high- and low-intensity infection and associated 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were predicted using Bayesian geostatistical models.
The number infected was determined from the predicted prevalence and the number of school-age children in each km².

FINDINGS
The 95% CrIs were wide: e.g. the mean number of boys aged 10-14 years infected in Mali was 140 200 (95% CrI: 6200-512 100).

CONCLUSION
National aggregate estimates of infection mask important local variations: e.g. most S. haematobium infections in the Niger occur in the Niger River valley.
High-intensity infection was strongly clustered in western and central Mali, north-eastern and north-western Burkina Faso and the Niger River valley in the Niger.
Populations in these foci will carry the bulk of the urinary schistosomiasis burden and should be prioritized for schistosomiasis control.
Uncertainties in the predicted prevalence and the numbers infected should be acknowledged by control programme planners.


OBJECTIVE
To study trends in the quality of the health care provided to children aged less than 5 years in Afghanistan between 2004 and 2006.

METHODS
In each year of the study, 500-600 health facilities providing the BPHS were selected by stratified random sampling in 29 provinces of Afghanistan.

FINDINGS
The quality of the assessment and counselling provided to sick children aged less than 5 years improved significantly between 2004 and 2006.
A 43.4% increase in the assessment index and a 28.7% increase in the counselling index (P < 0.001) were noted.
Counselling quality was also significantly associated with these characteristics, except for provider cadre and child age.
The presence of clinical guidelines and the frequency of supervision were significantly associated with improved quality scores in 2006 (P < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively).


METHODS
Those data were supplemented through a complementary search covering the period 2003-2007.
Region-specific multiple regression models were used to estimate the preterm birth rates for countries with no data.

FINDINGS
We estimated that in 2005, 12.9 million births, or 9.6% of all births worldwide, were preterm.
The highest rates of preterm birth were in Africa and North America (11.9% and 10.6% of all births, respectively), and the lowest were in Europe (6.2%).

CONCLUSION
Preterm birth is an important perinatal health problem across the globe.
Developing countries, especially those in Africa and southern Asia, incur the highest burden in terms of absolute numbers, although a high rate is also observed in North America.
A better understanding of the causes of preterm birth and improved estimates of the incidence of preterm birth at the country level are needed to improve access to effective obstetric and neonatal care.


METHODS
A secondary analysis of data on 9424 mother-infant pairs in Ghana, India and Peru was conducted.
Malnutrition indicators were determined using WHO and NCHS growth standards.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight in infants aged < 6 months was higher with WHO than NCHS standards.
However, the prevalence of underweight in infants aged 6-12 months was much lower with WHO standards.
The duration of exclusive breastfeeding was not associated with malnutrition in the first 6 months of life.
In infants aged < 6 months, severe underweight at the first immunization visit as determined using WHO standards had the highest sensitivity (70.2%) and specificity (85.8%) for predicting mortality in India.
No indicator was a good predictor in Ghana or Peru.
In infants aged 6-12 months, underweight at 6 months had the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality in Ghana (37.0% and 82.2%, respectively) and Peru (33.3% and 97.9% respectively), while wasting was the best predictor in India (sensitivity: 54.6%; specificity: 85.5%).

CONCLUSION
Malnutrition indicators determined using WHO standards were better predictors of mortality than those determined using NCHS standards.
No association was found between breastfeeding duration and malnutrition at 6 months.
Use of WHO child growth standards highlighted the importance of malnutrition in the first 6 months of life.


METHODS
We studied 132 children without head lice who lived in a slum in north-eastern Brazil.
We randomized the households of the study participants into an intervention and a control group and prospectively calculated the incidence of infestation with head lice among the children in each group.
In the intervention group, all of the children's family members who lived in the household were treated with ivermectin; in the control group, no family member was treated.
We used the χ2 test with continuity correction or Fisher's exact test to compare proportions.
We performed survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimates with log rank testing and the Mann-Whitney U test to analyse the length of lice-free periods among sentinel children, and we used Cox regression to analyse survival data on a multivariate level.
We also carried out a subgroup analysis based on gender.

FINDINGS
Children in the intervention group remained free from infestation with head lice significantly longer than children in the control group.
The median infestation-free period in the intervention group was 24 days (interquartile range, IQR: 11-45), as compared to 14 days (IQR: 11-25) in the control group (P = 0.01).
Household-wide treatment with ivermectin proved significantly more effective among boys than among girls (P = 0.005).
After treatment with ivermectin, the estimated number of annual episodes of head lice infestation was reduced from 19 to 14 in girls and from 15 to 5 in boys.
Female sex and extreme poverty were independent risk factors associated with a shortened disease-free period.

CONCLUSION
In an impoverished community, girls and the poorest of the poor are the population groups that are most vulnerable for head lice infestation.
To decrease the number of head lice episodes per unit of time, control measures should include the treatment of all household contacts.
Mass treatment with ivermectin may reduce the incidence of head lice infestation and associated morbidity in resource-poor communities.


METHODS
We conducted a historical cohort study of consecutive indigenous birth cohorts between 1 April 1998 and 28 February 2005.
Children were followed up to 18 months of age.
The PCV7 programme commenced on 1 June 2001.
All chest X-rays taken within 3 days of any hospitalization were assessed.
The primary endpoint was a first episode of WHO-defined pneumonia requiring hospitalization.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare disease incidence.

FINDINGS
Of the children studied, 27% had received 3 doses of vaccine by 7 months of age.
Hazard ratios for endpoint pneumonia were 1.01 for 1 versus 0 doses; 1.03 for 2 versus 0 doses; and 0.84 for 3 versus 0 doses.

CONCLUSION
These findings might be explained by lack of timely vaccination and/or occurrence of disease at an early age.
Additionally, the relative contribution of vaccine-type pneumococcus to severe pneumonia in a setting where multiple other pathogens are prevalent may differ with respect to other settings where vaccine efficacy has been clearly established.


METHODS
In each of six Asian cities or periurban areas, a team randomly selected urban clusters for conducting standardized household surveys, neighbourhood background surveys and entomological surveys.
They collected information on vector breeding sites, people's knowledge, attitudes and practices surrounding dengue, and the characteristics of the study areas.

FINDINGS
The most productive vector breeding sites were outdoor water containers, particularly if uncovered, beneath shrubbery and unused for at least one week.
Peridomestic and intradomestic areas were much more important for pupal production than commercial and public spaces other than schools and religious facilities.
A complex but non-significant association was found between water supply and pupal counts, and lack of waste disposal services was associated with higher vector abundance in only one site.
Greater knowledge about dengue and its transmission was associated with lower mosquito breeding and production.
Vector control measures (mainly larviciding in one site) substantially reduced larval and pupal counts and "pushed" mosquito breeding to alternative containers.

CONCLUSION
Vector breeding and the production of adult Aedes aegypti are influenced by a complex interplay of factors.


Title
Community-based interventions for diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections in Nepal.

PROBLEM
Acute diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most common causes of child mortality worldwide.

APPROACH
We reviewed and analysed policy decisions and programme development, implementation and expansion.


METHODS
Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequality in stunting was measured by means of the slope index and the concentration index of inequality, respectively.

FINDINGS
Over a 33-year period, we documented a steady decline in the national prevalence of stunting from 37.1% to 7.1%.
Prevalence dropped from 59.0% to 11.2% in the poorest quintile and from 12.1% to 3.3% among the wealthiest quintile.

CONCLUSION
Future studies will show whether these gains will be maintained under the current global economic crisis.


METHODS
Women of reproductive age in 40 000 nationally representative households responded to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2005-2006.
We used a concentration index (CI) to assess distribution of nine MCH indicator groups across the household wealth index.

FINDINGS
Child underweight (CI: "0.2192; P < 0.01) and stunting (CI: "0.1767; P < 0.01) were least equitably distributed, being disproportionately concentrated among the poor; these were followed by teenage pregnancy (CI: "0.1073; P < 0.01), and child pneumonia (CI: "0.0896; P < 0.05) and diarrhoea (CI: "0.0531; P < 0.1).
Distribution of the MCH interventions was fairly equitable, but richer women were more likely to receive prenatal care and delivery by a skilled health worker or in a health facility.
The most equitably distributed interventions were child immunization and family planning.
All undesirable health outcomes were more prevalent among rural residents, although the urban-rural gap in MCH services was small.
Where mothers or caregivers had no formal education, all outcome indicators were worse than in the group with the highest level of education.

CONCLUSION
Equity of coverage in key MCH services is high throughout Thailand.


METHODS
Cape Town mortality data for the period 2001-2006 were analysed by age, cause of death and sex.
Cause-of-death codes were aggregated into three main cause groups: (i) pre-transitional causes (e.g. communicable diseases, maternal causes, perinatal conditions and nutritional deficiencies), (ii) noncommunicable diseases and (iii) injuries.
Premature mortality was calculated in years of life lost (YLLs).
Population estimates for the Cape Town Metro district were used to calculate age-specific rates per 100 000 population, which were then age-standardized and compared across subdistricts.

FINDINGS
HIV/AIDS has replaced homicide as the leading cause of death.
HIV/AIDS, homicide, tuberculosis and road traffic injuries accounted for 44% of all premature mortality.
Khayelitsha, the poorest subdistrict, had the highest levels of mortality for all main cause groups.

CONCLUSION
Multisectoral interventions will be required to reduce the burden of disease.


Title
Community-directed interventions for priority health problems in Africa: results of a multicountry study.

METHODS
A three-year experimental study was undertaken in 35 health districts from 2005 to 2007 in seven research sites in Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda.
Four trial districts and one comparison district were randomly selected in each site.
At the end of each of the three study years, we performed quantitative evaluations of intervention coverage and provider costs, as well as qualitative assessments of the CDI process.

FINDINGS
With the CDI strategy, significantly higher coverage was achieved than with other delivery approaches for all interventions except for short-course, directly-observed treatment.
The coverage of malaria interventions more than doubled.
The district-level costs of delivering all five interventions were lower in the CDI districts, but no cost difference was found at the first-line health facility level.


METHODS
Published survey reports were included in the analysis if they contained HIV testing data and wealth quintile rankings.
Trends in the relation between gender-specific HIV prevalence and household wealth quintile were determined with the X2 test and compared across the 12 countries, and also within one country (the United Republic of Tanzania) at two points in time.

FINDINGS
The relationship between the prevalence of HIV infection and household wealth quintile did not show consistent trends in all countries.
In particular, rates of HIV infection in higher-income countries did not increase with wealth.

CONCLUSION
Both wealth and poverty can lead to potentially risky or protective behaviours.
Context-specific risks should be the targets of HIV prevention initiatives tailored to local factors.


METHODS
We carried out a population-based household survey in rural Nimba county and a health facility survey in clinics and hospitals nearest to study villages.

FINDINGS
Data were obtained from 1405 individuals (98% response rate) selected with a three-stage population-representative sampling method, and from 43 of Nimba county's 49 health facilities selected because of proximity to the study villages.
Respondents travelled an average of 136 minutes to reach a health facility.
All respondents could access malaria treatment at the nearest facility and 55.9% could access HIV testing.
Only 26.8%, 14.5%, and 12.1% could access emergency obstetric care, integrated management of child illness and mental health services, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The reasons for the disparities in the services available to the population are technical and political.
More frequently available services (HIV testing, malaria treatment) were less complex to implement and represented diseases favoured by bilateral and multilateral health sector donors.
Systematic investments in the health system are required to ensure that health services respond to current and future health priorities.


Title
How valuable are environmental health interventions?

METHODS
We combined propensity-score “pre-matching” and rich pre-post panel data on 9500 households in 242 villages located in four geographically different districts to estimate the economic benefits of a large-scale community demand-driven water supply programme in Maharashtra, India.
We calculated coping costs and cost of illness by adding across several elements of coping and illness and then estimated causal impacts using a difference-in-difference strategy on the pre-matched sample.
The pre-post design allowed us to use a difference-in-difference estimator to measure “treatment effect” by comparing treatment and control villages during both periods.
We compared average household costs with respect to out-of-pocket medical expenses, patients' lost income, caregiving costs, time spent on collecting water, time spent on sanitation, and water treatment costs due to filtration, boiling, chemical use and storage.

FINDINGS
Three years after programme initiation, the number of households using piped water and private pit latrines had increased by 10% on average, but no changes in hygiene-related behaviour had occurred.
Poorer, socially marginalized households benefited more, in alignment with programme objectives.


OBJECTIVE
Health impact assessment (HIA) has been proposed as one mechanism that can inform decision-making by public policy-makers.
However, HIA methodology has been criticized for a lack of rigour in its use of evidence.
The aim of this work was to formulate, develop and test a practical guide to reviewing publicly available evidence for use in HIA.
The term evidence includes all scientific assessments, whether research studies in peer-reviewed journals or previous HIAs.

METHODS
Finally, the guide was tested in practice by invited volunteers who used it to appraise existing HIA evidence reviews.

FINDINGS
During development, a wealth of data was generated on how the guide might be applied in practice, on terminology, on ensuring clarity of the text and on additional resources needed.
During testing, it enabled users to discriminate between satisfactory and unsatisfactory evidence reviews.
By late 2009, 1700 printed and 2500 downloaded copies of the guide had been distributed.


METHODS
This report focuses on observations of student behaviour during school bus rides.
Future reports will discuss the other findings.
Student behaviours were assessed by means of c2 tests and logistic regression models.

FINDINGS
Observations were made on 362 rides on 125 buses on which 11 000 pupils travelled to and from school.
Seatbelt use among the pupils was limited: on 23% of the rides all pupils fastened seatbelts, while on 42% none did.
Seatbelt use was more frequent among primary school pupils than among older pupils.
Pupil behaviours, such as rowdiness, noisiness, conflicts between pupils and not remaining seated were observed.
These and other unsafe behaviours were more frequent on afternoon bus rides (odds ratio, OR: 3.2, 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.1-5.3), on routes with 5+ bus stops (OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 2.5-6.5) and on rides with primary school pupils (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.9).

CONCLUSION
Innovative strategies for improving pupil behaviour on school buses are needed to increase pupil safety.


METHODS
The programme started delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in October 2004.
Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the groups.

FINDINGS
A total of 5719 adults initiated on ART were included (67.9% female).
Median baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was 116 cells/μl (interquartile range, IQR: 53-173).
There was an increase in the proportion of women who initiated ART while pregnant but no change in other baseline characteristics over time.
Overall retention in care at 12 months was 84.0% (95% confidence interval, CI: 82.6-85.3); 10.9% died (95% CI: 9.8-12.0); 3.7% were lost to follow-up (95% CI: 3.0-4.4).
Mortality was highest in the first 3 months after ART initiation: 30.1 deaths per 100 person-years (95% CI: 26.3-34.5).
At 12 months 23.0% had a detectable viral load (> 25 copies/ml) (95% CI: 19.5-25.5).

CONCLUSION
Outcomes were not affected by rapid expansion of this decentralized HIV treatment programme.


METHODS
Empirical studies were dealing with an actual tax, while modelling studies predicted outcomes based on a hypothetical tax or subsidy.

FINDINGS
Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 were from the peer-reviewed literature and 11 were published on line.
There were 8 empirical and 16 modelling studies.
Nine studies assessed the impact of taxes on food consumption only, 5 on consumption and body weight, 4 on consumption and disease and 6 on body weight only.
In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction, with larger taxes being associated with more significant changes in consumption, body weight and disease incidence.
However, studies that focused on a single target food or nutrient may have overestimated the impact of taxes by failing to take into account shifts in consumption to other foods.
The quality of the evidence was generally low.
Almost all studies were conducted in high-income countries.

CONCLUSION
Food taxes and subsidies have the potential to contribute to healthy consumption patterns at the population level.


METHODS
Standardized methods of searching and data abstraction were used.
Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random effects models.

FINDINGS
Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria.

CONCLUSION
Current evidence suggests that interventions targeting people living with HIV in developing countries increase condom use, especially among HIV-serodiscordant couples.


OBJECTIVE
Dengue has been reportable in Cambodia since 1980.
Virological surveillance began in 2000 and sentinel surveillance was established at six hospitals in 2001.
Currently, national surveillance comprises passive and active data collection and reporting on hospitalized children aged 0-15 years.
This report summarizes surveillance data collected since 1980.

FINDINGS
During 1980-2001, epidemics occurred in cycles of 3-4 years, with the cycles subsequently becoming less prominent.
For 2002-2008 data, linear regression analysis detected no significant trend in the annual reported age-adjusted incidence of dengue (incidence range: 0.7-3.0 per 1000 population).
The incidence declined in 2.7% of the 185 districts studied, was unchanged in 86.2% and increased in 9.6%.
The age-specific incidence was highest in infants aged <1 year and children aged 4-6 years.
The incidence was higher during rainy seasons.
Although larvicide has been distributed in 94 districts since 2002, logistic regression analysis showed no association between the intervention and dengue incidence.

CONCLUSION
The dengue burden remained high among young children in Cambodia, which reflects intense transmission.
The national vector control programme appeared to have little impact on disease incidence.


METHODS
In a well-defined population that was under surveillance for 18 months, we followed a dynamic cohort of 63788 residents whose households were visited monthly by community health workers to identify deaths.
Trained physicians performed verbal autopsies and experienced senior physicians assigned the primary cause of death according to the International classification of diseases, 10th edition.
We tabulated causes of death in accordance with Global Burden of Disease 2000 categories and assessed overall and cause-specific mortality rates per age group and gender.

FINDINGS
During 87921 person-years of follow-up, we recorded 544 deaths.
This gave an overall mortality rate of 6.2 per 1000 person-years.
We assigned a cause to 89% (482/544) of the deaths.
Most deaths in children under 5 years of age were caused by tuberculosis, respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases.

CONCLUSION
Although the most common causes of death in children were infectious, non-communicable diseases were predominant among adults.


METHODS
In our study, CD4 testing was considered complete once a patient had retrieved the test results.
We identified predictors for completion through multivariate logistic regression.

FINDINGS
Of the 416 patients who tested positive for HIV, 84.6% initiated CD4 testing within the study timeframe.
Among those not immediately eligible for ART (CD4 cells >200/µl), only 14.9% completed CD4 testing within 12 weeks.
Overall, of HIV+ patients who initiated CD4 testing, 65% did not complete it within 12 weeks of diagnosis.
The higher the baseline CD4 cell count, the lower the odds of completing CD4 testing within 12 weeks.

CONCLUSION
Patient losses between HIV testing, baseline CD4 cell count and the start of care and ART are high.
As a result, many patients receive ART too late.
Health information systems that link testing programmes with care and treatment programmes are needed.


METHODS
Between November 2001 and November 2007, 50275 HIV-positive individuals aged > 14 years (69% female; median age: 36.2 years) were enrolled in the study.
The incidence of loss to follow-up was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and factors associated with loss to follow-up were identified by logistic and Cox multivariate regression analysis.

FINDINGS
Overall, 8% of individuals attended no follow-up visits, and 54% of them were lost to follow-up.
The overall incidence of loss to follow-up was 25.1 per 100 person-years.
Among the 92% who attended at least one follow-up visit, the incidence of loss to follow-up before and after starting cART was 27.2 and 14.0 per 100 person-years, respectively.
Men were at an increased risk overall and before and after starting cART.

CONCLUSION
The risk of being lost to follow-up was high, particularly before starting cART.
Men were more likely to become lost to follow-up, even after adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.


METHODS
Data on morbidity and mortality caused by enteric fever between 1994 and 2004 were extracted from the Guangxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Laboratory-based surveillance and outbreak investigations were integrated with reports of notifiable infectious diseases to estimate the bacterial species-specific incidence of enteric fever.
To adjust for underreporting, survey data were collected from three prefectures that represent the hyper-, moderate- and low-endemic regions of Guangxi province.

FINDINGS
In Guangxi province, enteric fever incidence rate varied over the study period, with a peak of 13.5 cases per 100000 population in 1995 and a low of 6.5 in 2003.
The disease occurred most frequently during the summer and autumn months and in the group aged 10-49 years.
The incidence of enteric fever varied by region within Guangxi province.
During the 11-year period covered by the study, 61 outbreaks of enteric fever were reported, and Salmonella paratyphi A (SPA) became the predominant causative agent in the province.

CONCLUSION
Prospective studies may provide a better understanding of the reason for the shifting epidemiology of enteric fever in Guangxi province.


METHODS
Studies of neonatal supplementation with vitamin A have yielded contradictory findings with regard to its effect on the risk of infant death, possibly owing to heterogeneity between studies.
One source of that heterogeneity is the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women, which we examined using meta-regression techniques on eligible individual and cluster-randomized trials.

FINDINGS
Meta-regression analysis revealed a statistically significant linear relationship between the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women and the observed effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation at birth.
In regions where at least 22% of pregnant women have vitamin A deficiency, giving neonates vitamin A supplements will have a protective effect against infant death.

CONCLUSION
A meta-regression analysis is observational in nature and may suffer from confounding bias.
Nevertheless, our study suggests that vitamin A supplementation can reduce infant mortality in regions where this micronutrient deficiency is common.
Thus, neonatal supplementation programmes may prove most beneficial in regions where the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency among pregnant women is high.


LOCAL SETTING
From March to December 2007, the scorecard was implemented in seven temporary health clinics.

RELEVANT CHANGES
By enhancing communication, the scorecard also led to qualitative benefits.

LESSONS LEARNT
Introducing a mechanism for rapid improvement fostered communication between nongovernmental organizations, district health officials, clinic health workers and displaced persons.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of cohorts of pregnant women and mothers of infants recruited systematically in 10 randomly-selected communes.
The women participated in psychiatrist-administered structured clinical interviews and separate structured interviews to assess sociodemographic factors, reproductive health, the intimate partner relationship, family violence and the use of preventive and psychiatric health care.
Associations between these variables and perinatal mental disorders were explored through univariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression.

FINDINGS
Among women eligible for the study (392), 364 (93%) were recruited.
Of these, 29.9% (95% confidence interval, CI: 25.20-34.70) were diagnosed with a common perinatal mental disorder (CPMD).
The frequency of such disorders during pregnancy and in the postpartum period was the same.
Fewer women with a CPMD used iron supplements than women without a CPMD, but the results were not statistically significant (P = 0.05).
None of the women studied had ever received mental health care.

CONCLUSION
Perinatal depression and anxiety are prevalent in women in northern Viet Nam.
These conditions are predominantly determined by social factors, including rural residence, poverty and exposure to family violence.


OBJECTIVE
Under Millennium Development Goal 4, countries are required to reduce child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.

FINDINGS
According to the empirical data, standard cross-sectional survey statistics underestimated true infant and under-5 mortality by 6.7% and 9.8%, respectively.
These estimates were in agreement with the output from the model, in which the bias varied according to the magnitude and stage of the epidemic of HIV infection and background mortality rates.
The bias was greater the longer the period elapsed before the survey and in later stages of the epidemic.
Bias could substantially distort the measured effect of interventions to reduce non-HIV-related mortality and of programmes to prevent mother-to-child transmission, especially when trends are based on data from a single survey.

CONCLUSION
The correlation between the HIV-related deaths of mothers and their children can bias survey estimates of early child mortality.


OBJECTIVE
China has about 350 million smokers, more commonly men.

METHODS
Data were collected from approximately 57 000 households and 200 000 individuals in each survey year.
Household members > 15 years of age were interviewed about their smoking habits, quitting intentions and attitudes towards smoking.
We present descriptive data stratified by age, sex, income level and rural versus urban residence.

FINDINGS
In China, current smoking in those > 15 years old declined 60-49% in men and 5-3.2% in women over 1993-2003.
The decline was more marked in urban areas.
However, heavy smoking (> 20 cigarettes daily) increased substantially overall and doubled in men.
The average age of uptake also dropped by about 3 years.
In 2003, 7.9% of smokers reported intending to quit, and 6% of people who had ever smoked reported having quit.
Of former smokers, 40.6% quit because of illness, 26.9% to prevent disease and 10.9% for financial reasons.

CONCLUSION
Further tobacco control efforts are urgently needed, especially in rural areas.


OBJECTIVE
WHODAS 2.0 is a standard metric for ensuring scientific comparability across different populations.

METHODS
A series of studies was carried out globally.

FINDINGS
Effect sizes ranged from 0.44 to 1.38 for different health interventions targeting various health conditions.


METHODS
We used data from the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System on the nursing workforce to determine the effect of the Emergency Hiring Plan on nurse shortages and maldistribution.

FINDINGS
Of the 18 181 nurses employed in Kenya's public sector in 2009, 1836 (10%) had been recruited since 2005 through the Emergency Hiring Plan.
Nursing staff increased by 7% in hospitals, 13% in health centres and 15% in dispensaries.
North Eastern province, which includes some of the most remote areas, benefited most: the number of nurses per 100 000 population increased by 37%.
The next greatest increase was in Nyanza province, which has the highest prevalence of HIV infection in Kenya.
Emergency Hiring Plan nurses enabled the number of functioning public health facilities to increase by 29%.
By February 2010, 94% of the nurses hired under pre-recruitment absorption agreements had entered the civil service.

CONCLUSION
The Emergency Hiring Plan for nurses significantly increased health services in Kenya's rural and underserved areas over the short term.
Preliminary indicators of sustainability are promising, as most nurses hired are now civil servants.
However, continued monitoring will be necessary over the long term to evaluate future nurse retention.
The accurate workforce data provided by the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System were essential for evaluating the effect of the Emergency Hiring Plan.


METHODS
We reviewed data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).
Although in these surveys all female respondents are < 50 years of age, 18 of the surveys contained data on HIV infection among men aged > 50 years.

FINDINGS
In 2007, approximately 3 million people aged > 50 years were living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
The prevalence of HIV infection in this group was 4.0%, compared with 5.0% among those aged 15-49 years.

CONCLUSION
To better reflect the longer survival of people living with HIV and the ageing of the HIV+ population, indicators of the prevalence of HIV infection should be expanded to include people > 49 years of age.
Little is known about comorbidity and sexual behaviour among HIV+ older adults or about the biological and cultural factors that increase the risk of transmission.
HIV services need to be better targeted to respond to the growing needs of older adults living with HIV.


METHODS
Using theatre logbook data, we determined the surgical rates, types of surgery performed and in-theatre surgical outcomes.

FINDINGS
Of 72 hospitals surveyed, 29 were performing major surgery.
None met WHO standards for essential surgery.
There were 0.7 accredited surgeons per 100 000 population and no paediatric surgeons.
Most anaesthetists were not physicians (accredited anaesthetist per 100 000 population: 1.1).
The annual surgical rate for children aged < 14 years was 180 operations per 100 000 population; most were emergency procedures.
The annual surgical rate for patients of all ages was 652 operations per 100 000 population, with a median of 422 per operating theatre (range: 60-3497) and of 226 per surgeon (range: 60-1748).
Mission or nongovernmental organization (NGO) hospitals, which had 44% of the hospital beds in the region, performed 3039 (55%) of the paediatric operations.
Externally funded surgeons performed 80% of the 140 cleft lip and palate operations.
Four in-theatre deaths occurred in children < 14 years old (in-theatre mortality: 7.7 deaths per 10 000 operations).

CONCLUSION
In-theatre mortality was lower than reported for similar settings.


METHODS
A community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 10 subdistricts in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital.
We used a structured questionnaire to collect data from a random sample of 540 households with at least one child aged < 5 years.
Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with antibiotic misuse.

FINDINGS
Of 503 participating caregivers, 71% were mothers; 42.3% (95% confidence interval, CI: 37.8-46.9) of caregivers had used non-prescribed antibiotics to treat symptoms in their child during the previous 6 months.
Symptoms commonly treated were cough (84%), fever (66%), nasal discharge (65%) and sore throat (60%).
Amoxicillin was the most commonly used antibiotic (58%).
Pharmacies were the main source (86%) of non-prescribed antibiotics.
Non-prescribed use by mothers was significantly associated with keeping antibiotics at home (odds ratio, OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.04-2.79), caregiver self-medication (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 3.8-10.5) and older child's age (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.04).
Caregivers with a better knowledge of antibiotics were less likely to give children non-prescribed antibiotics (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6-0.8).

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of non-prescribed antibiotic use for young children was high in Ulaanbaatar.


METHODS
The predicted trend (based on the trend in previous years) and the target trend (based on MDG 1) for stunting and underweight were estimated using linear regression.

FINDINGS
The choice of indicator affects the conclusions regarding which countries are on track to reach MDG 1.
Another two countries come within 2 percentage points of the target prevalence of stunting.

CONCLUSION
Unfortunately, underweight is the indicator officially used to monitor progress towards MDG 1.


METHODS
The search included Medline, EMBASE, other web-based and non-web-based sources and the bibliographies of the sources identified.
Experts were also consulted.

FINDINGS
Five studies and nine guidelines were identified.

CONCLUSION
The evidence available is consistent with the conclusion that all identified guidelines are within the limits of "minimal risk."
However, more and better evidence is required to draw firmer conclusions.
Researchers and institutional review boards need to take into account the total sampling volume needed for both clinical care and research rather than for each alone.
The child's general state of health should be considered and extra caution should be observed particularly with children whose illness can deplete blood volume or haemoglobin or hinder their replenishment.
Local policies must also address the appropriateness and local acceptability of collection procedures and of the blood volumes drawn.


METHODS
We carried out 21 user tests in six countries to explore users' experiences with the summary format.
We modified the summaries based on the results and checked our conclusions through 13 follow-up interviews.

FINDINGS
Policy-makers liked a graded entry format (i.e. short summary with key messages up front).
They particularly valued the section on the relevance of the summaries for LMICs, which compensated for the lack of locally-relevant detail in the original review.
Some struggled to understand the text and numbers.
Three issues made redesigning the summaries particularly challenging: (i) participants had a poor understanding of what a systematic review was; (ii) they expected information not found in the systematic reviews and (iii) they wanted shorter, clearer summaries.
Solutions included adding information to help understand the nature of a systematic review, adding more references and making the content clearer and the document quicker to scan.

CONCLUSION
They should also explain the nature of the information provided by systematic reviews and its relevance for policy decisions.


METHODS
Using data from nationally representative health examination surveys conducted in 1998-2007, we studied a probability sample of 79 039 adults aged 40-79 years from England, Germany, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, Scotland, Thailand and the United States of America.
For each country we calculated the prevalence of high total serum cholesterol (total serum cholesterol > 6.2 mmol/l or > 240 mg/dl) and the mean total serum cholesterol level.
We also determined the fractions of individuals being diagnosed, treated with cholesterol-lowering medication and effectively controlled (total serum cholesterol < 6.2 mmol/l or < 240 mg/dl).

FINDINGS
The proportion of undiagnosed individuals was highest in Thailand (78%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 74-82) and lowest in the United States (16%; 95% CI: 13-19).
The fraction diagnosed but untreated ranged from 9% in Thailand (95% CI: 8-11) to 53% in Japan (95% CI: 50-57).
The proportion being treated who had attained evidence of control ranged from 4% in Germany (95% CI: 3-5) to 58% in Mexico (95% CI: 54-63).
Time series estimates showed improved control of high total serum cholesterol over the past two decades in England and the United States.

CONCLUSION
The percentage of people with high total serum cholesterol who are effectively treated remains small in selected high- and middle-income countries.
Many of those affected are unaware of their condition.
Untreated high blood cholesterol represents a missed opportunity in the face of a global epidemic of chronic diseases.


METHODS
In 2002-2006, clinical information was obtained from all children admitted to Kilifi District Hospital and linked to demographic surveillance data.
Travel times to the hospital were calculated using geographic information systems and regression models were constructed to examine the relationships between travel time, cause-specific hospitalization rates and probability of death in hospital.
Access to care ratios relating hospitalization rates to community mortality rates were computed and used to estimate surveillance sensitivity.

FINDINGS
The analysis included 7200 admissions (64 per 1000 child-years).
Median pedestrian and vehicular travel times to hospital were 237 and 61 minutes, respectively.
Hospitalization rates decreased by 21% per hour of travel by foot and 28% per half hour of travel by vehicle.
Distance decay was steeper for meningitis than for pneumonia, for females than for males, and for areas where mothers had less education on average.
Distance was positively associated with the probability of dying in hospital.
Overall access to care ratios, which represent the probability that a child in need of hospitalization will have access to care at the hospital, were 51-58% for pneumonia and 66-70% for meningitis.

CONCLUSION
In this setting, hospital utilization rates decreased and the severity of cases admitted to hospital increased as distance between homestead and hospital increased.
Access to hospital care for children living in remote areas was low, particularly for those with less severe conditions.
Distance decay was attenuated by increased levels of maternal education.
Hospital-based surveillance underestimated pneumonia and meningitis incidence by more than 45% and 30%, respectively.


METHODS
Trends were examined for 24 countries that had conducted at least two surveys between 1986 and 2007.

FINDINGS
In western Africa, the subjective need for contraception remained unchanged; about 46% of married or cohabiting women reported a desire to stop and/or postpone childbearing for at least two years.
The percentage of women who approved of contraception rose from 32 to 39 and the percentage with access to contraceptive methods rose from 8 to 29.
The proportion of women who were using a modern method when interviewed increased from 7 to 15% (equivalent to an average annual increase of 0.6 percentage points).
In eastern African countries, trends were much more favourable, with contraceptive use showing an average annual increase of 1.4 percentage points (from 16% in 1986 to 33% in 2007).

CONCLUSION
In western Africa, progress towards adoption of contraception has been dismally slow.
Attitudinal resistance remains a barrier and access to contraceptives, though improving, is still shockingly limited.
If this situation does not change radically in the short run, the United Nations population projections for this subregion are likely to be exceeded.
In eastern Africa, the prospects for a future decline in fertility are much more positive.


METHODS
After the main cost categories for each country were identified, validation questionnaires were sent to 32 countries with high child mortality.
Publicly available estimates for disease incidence, intervention coverage, prices and resources for individual-level and programme-level activities were validated against local data.
Nine updates to the 2007 WHO model were generated using revised assumptions.
Finally, estimates were extrapolated to 75 countries and combined with cost estimates for immunization and malaria programmes and for programmes for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

FINDINGS
Twenty-six countries responded.
Adjustments were largest for system- and programme-level data and smallest for patient data.
The additional effect of updated population figures was small; updated epidemiologic figures increased costs by US$ 4 billion (+15%).
New unit prices in the 26 countries that provided data increased estimates by US$ 4.3 billion (+16%).
Extrapolation to 75 countries increased the original price estimate by US$ 33 billion (+80%) for 2010-2015.

CONCLUSION
Country-level validation had a significant effect on the cost estimate.
Price adaptations and programme-related assumptions contributed substantially.
An additional 74 billion US$ 2005 (representing a 12% increase in total health expenditure) would be needed between 2010 and 2015.
Given resource constraints, countries will need to prioritize health activities within their national resource envelope.


METHODS
CV risk factor prevalence and a CV risk prediction chart for Africa were used to estimate the 10-year risk of suffering a fatal or non-fatal CV event among individuals aged 40-64 years.
Treatment for patients with high total CV risk (> 20%) was assumed to consist of a fixed-dose combination of several drugs (polypill).
Cost analyses were limited to medication.

FINDINGS
A total CV risk of > 10% and > 20% was found among 10.8% and 5.1% of individuals, respectively.
Management based on high total CV risk optimizes the balance between the number requiring treatment and the number of CV events averted.

CONCLUSION
These findings are relevant for all countries, but especially for those economically and demographically similar to Seychelles.


METHODS
From this information, neonatal, infant and early child mortality rates were estimated.
The age at death for early child mortality was determined by the mean interval between successive births and the mean age of neonates at registration.

FINDINGS
In 2005-2006, infant mortality among Palestine refugees ranged from 28 deaths per 100 000 live births in the Syrian Arab Republic to 19 in Lebanon.
Thus, infant mortality in Palestine refugees is among the lowest in the Near East.
However, infant mortality has stopped decreasing in recent years, although it remains at a level compatible with the attainment of Millennium Development Goal 4.

CONCLUSION
However, it is no longer dropping.


METHODS
Data on counselling and testing were collected in registers.

FINDINGS
The median time between testing and enrolment was 6 days.

CONCLUSION
The introduction of routine PITC using lay counsellors into health-care clinics in Lusaka, Zambia, dramatically increased the uptake and acceptability of HIV testing.
Moreover, PITC was incorporated rapidly into primary care outpatient departments.
Maximizing the number of patients who proceed to HIV care and treatment remains a challenge and warrants further research.


METHODS
The financial repercussions of medical tourism were estimated from commerce ministry data, with modifications and extrapolations.
Survey data on 4755 foreign and Thai outpatients in two private hospitals were used to explore how medical tourism affects human resources.
Trends in the relative prices of caesarean section, appendectomy, hernia repair, cholecystectomy and knee replacement in five private hospitals were examined.

FINDINGS
The "brain drain" may also undermine medical training in future.

CONCLUSION
The revenue thus generated could then be used to train physicians and retain medical school professors.


METHODS
The risk of tuberculosis attributable to diabetes was estimated from statistics for the corresponding adult population.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of diabetes among TB patients was 39% in Texas and 36% in Mexico.

CONCLUSION
Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of contracting TB than non-diabetic patients.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data obtained from four National Health Service Surveys were used to determine trends in hospital births during 1988-2008.

FINDINGS
In 2008 women throughout China were giving birth in hospital almost universally except in region IV, the most remote rural region, where the percentage of hospital births was only 60.8.
Hospital births in this region had increased steadily before 2002, but after that year the upward trend slowed down.
During 1988-2001 the average yearly increase had been 21%, but in 2002-2008 it dropped to 10% (P=0.0031).
Inequalities between socioeconomic regions were greater than among individual households belonging to different income strata.

CONCLUSION
Most Chinese women now give birth in hospital, but the poorest rural region is still lagging behind.


METHODS
In the ANRS 12103 open phase II trial, HIV-infected children were examined at inclusion and monthly thereafter.
CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count, plasma concentration of ribonucleic acid (RNA) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and haematologic and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline and every trimester.
HIV-1 resistance testing was performed in case of viral escape.
Drug plasma concentrations were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography.

FINDINGS
From February 2006 to November 2007, 51 children (39% girls) with a mean age of 6.8 years were enrolled and treated for 12 months.
At baseline, Z scores for mean weight-for-age and mean height-for-age were -2.01 and -2.12, respectively.
Mean CD4% was 9.0.
Median plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 5.51 log10 copies per millilitre (cp/ml).
Two children (3.9%) died and another 11 (22%) suffered 13 severe clinical events.
At month 12, mean WAZ had improved by 0.63 (P < 0.001) and mean HAZ by 0.57 (P < 0.001).
Mean CD4% had risen to 24 (P < 0.001).
Viral load was below 300 RNA cp/ml in 81% of the children; HIV resistance mutations were detected in 11 (21.6%).

CONCLUSION
Dose adjustment should further improve efficacy.


METHODS
Data were obtained on 24 277 preschool-age children in western Africa (2862 cluster sites) and 25 343 in eastern Africa (2999 cluster sites) from the 2001-2007 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for sub-Saharan Africa.
Cluster sites were linked to environmental information on distance to perennial water body, elevation, land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a proxy for rainfall) in a geographical information system.
Statistical associations with environmental variables were determined using multivariate regression models, and the spatial dependence of haemoglobin concentration unexplained by these factors was quantified using semivariograms.

FINDINGS
Our results show significant continent-wide associations between haemoglobin concentration and environmental variables, particularly in western Africa for land surface temperature and NDVI, and in eastern Africa for elevation.
Residual spatial dependence was significant, and the magnitude was greater in western than in eastern Africa.

CONCLUSION
The distribution of anaemia is driven by large-scale environmental factors, and the epidemiological drivers differ in western and eastern Africa.


METHODS
The drugs, laboratory tests and intravenous fluids provided to 2300 patients from admission to discharge were recorded, as was the length of inpatient stay, to calculate the cost of inpatient care.
The data were matched with pooled clinical outcomes and entered into a decision model to calculate the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted and the cost per death averted.

FINDINGS
The mean cost of treating severe malaria patients was similar in the two study groups: 63.5 United States dollars (US$) (95% confidence interval, CI: 61.7-65.2) in the quinine arm and US$ 66.5 (95% CI: 63.7-69.2) in the artesunate arm.
Children treated with artesunate had 22.5% lower mortality than those treated with quinine and the same rate of neurological sequelae: (artesunate arm: 2.3 DALYs per patient; quinine arm: 3.0 DALYs per patient).
Compared with quinine as a baseline, artesunate showed an incremental cost per DALY averted and an incremental cost per death averted of US$ 3.8 and US$ 123, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The budgetary implications of adopting artesunate for routine use in hospital-based care are negligible.


METHODS
Mortality from TB since 1990 was estimated for 213 countries using established methods endorsed by WHO.
Mortality trends were estimated separately for people with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in accordance with the International classification of diseases.
Lives saved by the DOTS/Stop TB Strategy were estimated with respect to the performance of TB control in 1995, the year that DOTS was introduced.

FINDINGS
TB mortality among HIV-negative (HIV-) people fell from 30 to 20 per 100 000 population (36%) between 1990 and 2009 and could be halved by 2015.
The overall decline (when including HIV-positive [HIV+] people, who comprise 12% of all TB cases) was 19%.
Between 1995 and 2009, 49 million TB patients were treated under the DOTS/Stop TB Strategy.
This saved 4.6-6.3 million lives, including those of 0.23-0.28 million children and 1.4-1.7 million women of childbearing age.
A further 1 million lives could be saved annually by 2015.

CONCLUSION
Intensified efforts to reduce deaths among HIV+ TB cases are needed, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.


METHODS
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, POPLINE, CAB Abstracts and ongoing trials registers were searched.
Experts were contacted.
Conference proceedings and reference lists were manually searched.
All study types, except single case reports, were included.

FINDINGS
Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one before-and-after study and two retrospective reports on clinical efficacy and safety were retrieved, together with 18 pharmacokinetic studies.
Trial quality was generally poor and results could not be pooled due to heterogeneity.
Oral amoxicillin for 5 days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2 days (1 RCT).
For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study).
The introduction of a standardized regimen using ampicillin and gentamicin significantly reduced mortality in hospitalized children (odds ratio, OR: 4.0; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-9.8; 1 before-and-after study).
Oral chloramphenicol was as effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in children with pneumonia (1 RCT).
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that normal doses of penicillins, cotrimoxazole and gentamicin are safe in malnourished children, while the dose or frequency of chloramphenicol requires adjustment.
Existing evidence is not strong enough to further clarify recommendations for antibiotic treatment in children with SAM.

CONCLUSION
Large RCTs are needed to define optimal antibiotic treatment in children with SAM with and without complications.
Further research into gentamicin and chloramphenicol toxicity and into the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin is also required.


METHODS
Six databases were searched for studies from developing countries on maternal depression and child growth published up until 2010.
The population attributable risk (PAR) was estimated for selected studies.

FINDINGS
Seventeen studies including a total of 13 923 mother and child pairs from 11 countries met inclusion criteria.
The children of mothers with depression or depressive symptoms were more likely to be underweight (OR: 1.5; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.2-1.8) or stunted (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7).
Subanalysis of three longitudinal studies showed a stronger effect: the OR for underweight was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.2) and for stunting, 2.0 (95% CI: 1.0-3.9).
The PAR for selected studies indicated that if the infant population were entirely unexposed to maternal depressive symptoms 23% to 29% fewer children would be underweight or stunted.

CONCLUSION
Maternal depression was associated with early childhood underweight and stunting.
Rigorous prospective studies are needed to identify mechanisms and causes.
Early identification, treatment and prevention of maternal depression may help reduce child stunting and underweight in developing countries.


METHODS
Performance was modelled for scenarios with pretest probabilities of 5% and 50%.

FINDINGS
In total 92 patients enrolled: 53 (57.6%) from South Africa and 39 (42.4%) from the United Republic of Tanzania.
Salmonella Typhi was isolated from the blood of 28 (30.4%) patients.
The semiquantitative slide agglutination and single-tube Widal tests had positive predictive values (PPVs) of 25.0% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.6-80.6) and 20.0% (95% CI: 2.5-55.6), respectively.
The newer typhoid rapid antibody tests had comparable PPVs: TUBEX®, 54.1% (95% CI: 36.9-70.5); Typhidot® IgM, 56.7% (95% CI: 37.4-74.5); and Typhidot® IgG, 54.3% (95% CI: 36.6-71.2).
For a pretest probability of 5%, PPVs were: TUBEX®, 11.0% (95% CI: 6.6-17.9); Typhidot® IgM, 9.1% (95% CI: 5.8-14.0); and Typhidot® IgG, 11.0% (6.3-18.4).
For a pretest probability of 50%, PPVs were: TUBEX®, 70.2% (95% CI: 57.3-80.5); Typhidot® IgM, 65.6% (95% CI: 54.0-75.6); and Typhidot® IgG, 70.0% (95% CI: 56.0-81.1).

CONCLUSION
Semiquantitative slide agglutination and single-tube Widal tests performed poorly.


METHODS
Also tested were 282 oral fluid specimens from the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) surveillance programme of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Microimmune measles IgM capture enzyme immunoassay was the gold standard for comparison.
A panel of 24 oral fluids was used to investigate if measles virus haemagglutinin (H) and nucleocapsid (N) genes could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction directly from used POCT strips.

FINDINGS
Measles virus genes could be recovered from POCT strips after storage for 5 weeks at 20-25 ºC.

CONCLUSION
The POCT has the sensitivity and specificity required of a field-based test for measles diagnosis.
However, its role in global measles control programmes requires further evaluation.


METHODS
We extracted data on mesothelioma deaths reported to the World Health Organization mortality database since 1994, when the disease was first recorded.
We also sought information from other English-language sources.
Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated and mortality trends were assessed from the annual percentage change in the age-adjusted mortality rate.

FINDINGS
In total, 92 253 mesothelioma deaths were reported by 83 countries.
Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were 6.2 and 4.9 per million population, respectively.
In contrast, less than 12% occurred in middle- and low-income countries.
The overall trend in the age-adjusted mortality rate was increasing in Europe and Japan but decreasing in the United States.

CONCLUSION
The number of mesothelioma deaths reported and the number of countries reporting deaths increased during the study period, probably due to better disease recognition and an increase in incidence.
The different time trends observed between countries may be an early indication that the disease burden is slowly shifting towards those that have used asbestos more recently.


METHODS
Cox regression models were developed to identify risk factors.

FINDINGS
age was protective (reference <1 month): 6-23 months, HR:0.8; 2-4 years, HR:0.6.
Children with at least one risk factor accounted for 545 (33%) of the 1655 annual discharges and for 39 (47%) of the 83 discharge-associated deaths.

CONCLUSION
Hospital admission selects vulnerable children with a sustained increased risk of dying.


METHODS
Between 2005 and 2007, 1797 Greenlandic schoolchildren in five different areas were tested for MTI with an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and a tuberculin skin test (TST).
Parents or guardians were surveyed using a standardized self-administered questionnaire to obtain data on crowding in the household, parents' educational level and the child's health status.
Demographic data for each child - i.e. parents' place of birth, number of siblings, distance between siblings (next younger and next older), birth order and mother's age when the child was born - were also extracted from a public registry.
Logistic regression was used to check for associations between these variables and MTI, and all results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Children were considered to have MTI if they tested positive on both the IGRA assay and the TST.

FINDINGS
The overall prevalence of MTI was 8.5% (152/1797).
MTI was diagnosed in 26.7% of the children with a known TB contact, as opposed to 6.4% of the children without such contact.
Overall, the MTI rate was higher among Inuit children (OR:4.22; 95% CI: 1.55-11.5) and among children born less than one year after the birth of the next older sibling (OR:2.48; 95% CI: 1.33-4.63).
Self-reported TB contact modified the profile to include household crowding and low mother's education.

CONCLUSION
The strong household clustering of MTI suggests that family sources of exposure are important.


METHODS
Ophthalmologists in 50 countries were invited to join the newly-established International Eye Research Network and asked to complete a web-based questionnaire about their eye hospitals.
Those who complied received a data collection form for recording demographic and clinical data on 100 consecutive patients about to undergo cataract surgery.
Countries were ranked into five HDI categories and multivariable regression was used to explore associations.

FINDINGS
Ophthalmologists at 112 eye hospitals (54% of them nongovernmental) in 50 countries provided data on 11 048 cataract procedures over 9 months in 2008.

CONCLUSION
Additionally, the internet can be an effective tool for developing and supporting an ophthalmological research network capable of providing a global snapshot of service activity, particularly in developing countries.


Title
Twenty-year trends in the prevalence of disability in China.

FINDINGS
The estimated number of disabled people in China in 1987 and 2006 was 52.7 and 84.6 million, respectively, corresponding to a weighted prevalence of 4.9% and 6.5%.
The age-adjusted prevalence of disability decreased by an average of 0.5% per year (average annual percentage change, AAPC: -0.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI: -0.7 to -0.4) during 1987-2006.
However, it increased by an average of 0.3% (AAPC: 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.5) per year in males and by an average of 1.0% (AAPC: 1.0%; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.2) per year among rural residents, whereas among females it showed an average annual decrease of 1.5% (AAPC: -1.5%; 95% CI: -1.7 to -1.3) and among urban residents, an average annual decrease of 3.9% (AAPC: -3.9%; 95% CI: -4.3 to -3.5).
Despite significant declining trends for hearing and speech, intellectual and visual disabilities, the annual age-adjusted prevalence of physical and mental disabilities increased by an average of 11.2% (AAPC: 11.2%; 95% CI: 10.5 to 11.9) and 13.3% (AAPC: 13.3%; 95% CI: 10.7 to 16.2), respectively.

CONCLUSION
These findings call for continuing and specific efforts to prevent disabilities in China.


METHODS
The completeness of core indicator measurement and the geographical representativeness of the surveys were assessed.

FINDINGS
Twenty six surveys met the inclusion criteria.
Due to the use of non-standard indicator definitions, measurement of core indicators in some of the national and subnational surveys was incomplete.

CONCLUSION
The availability of data on core risk factor indicators to monitor the increasing burden of NCDs is inadequate in India.
These indicators using standardized definitions should be included in the periodic national household health surveys to provide data at the national and disaggregated levels.


METHODS
The World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems was used to assess the accessibility of mental health services for schizophrenic disorders and their utilization.
Multivariate analysis using backward step-wise regression was performed to assess predictors of accessibility, treatment gap and service utilization.

FINDINGS
The median annual rate of treatment for schizophrenic disorders in mental health services was 128 cases per 100 000 population.
Of the people with schizophrenic disorders, 80% were treated in outpatient facilities.
The availability of psychiatrists and nurses in mental health facilities was found to be a significant predictor of service accessibility and treatment gap.

CONCLUSION
The significant predictors found suggest an avenue for improving care in these countries.


METHODS
Data on drug resistance among new and previously treated TB patients, as reported by countries to the World Health Organization, were analysed.
Such data are collected through surveys of a representative sample of TB patients or surveillance systems based on routine drug susceptibility testing.
Associations between multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and sex were explored through logistic regression.

FINDINGS
In 2007-2010, 80 countries and 8 territories reported surveillance data.
MDR-TB among new and previously treated cases was highest in the Russian Federation (Murmansk oblast, 28.9%) and the Republic of Moldova (65.1%), respectively.
In three former Soviet Union countries and South Africa, more than 10% of the cases of MDR-TB were extensively drug-resistant.
Globally, in 1994 to 2010 multidrug resistance was observed in 3.4% (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.9-5.0) of all new TB cases and in 19.8% (95% CI: 14.4-25.1) of previously treated TB cases.
No overall associations between MDR-TB and HIV infection (odds ratio, OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 0.7-3.0) or sex (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8-1.4) were found.
Between 1994 and 2010, MDR-TB rates in the general population increased in Botswana, Peru, the Republic of Korea and declined in Estonia, Latvia and the United States of America.

CONCLUSION
The highest global rates of MDR-TB ever reported were documented in 2009 and 2010.
Trends in MDR-TB are still unclear in most settings.
Better surveillance or survey data are required, especially from Africa and India.


METHODS
Weighted logistic regression using data for each country was performed to determine the independent correlates of each outcome.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of FGC was high overall but varied substantially across countries in western Africa.
In Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina Faso and Mauritania, the prevalence of FGC was 94%, 79%, 74% and 72%, respectively, whereas in Ghana, Niger and Togo prevalence was less than 6%.
The association between FGC and wealth varied considerably.

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of FGC in western Africa remains high overall but varies substantially across countries.


METHODS
The mothers' uptake of interventions for the prevention of MTCT was explored.

FINDINGS
Overall, 40.4% of the 7981 infants tested were found positive for anti-HIV antibodies, indicating HIV exposure.
Just 7.1% of the infants checked for HIV DNA (equating to 2.8% of the infants tested for anti-HIV antibodies) were found positive.

CONCLUSION
The low levels of MTCT observed among the infants indicate the rapid, successful implementation of interventions for the prevention of such transmission.
Sampling at immunization clinics appears to offer a robust method of estimating the impact of interventions designed to reduce such transmission.


METHODS
Concordance between maternal and attendant responses was calculated for all questions, for categories of questions and for individual questions.
The sensitivity and specificity of individual questions with the birth attendant as respondent were assessed.

FINDINGS
For early neonatal deaths, concordance across all questions was 94%.
Concordance was at least 95% for more than half the questions on maternal medical history, birth attendance and neonate characteristics.
Concordance on any given question was never less than 80%.
Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions, more than 80% of which had a sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 90%.
For stillbirths, concordance across all questions was 93%.
Concordance was 95% or greater more than half the time for questions on birth attendance, site of delivery and stillborn characteristics.
Sensitivity and specificity varied across individual questions.
Over 60% of the questions had a sensitivity of at least 80% and over 80% of them had a specificity of at least 90%.
Overall, the causes of death established through verbal autopsy were similar, regardless of respondent.

CONCLUSION
Birth attendants can substitute for bereaved mothers as verbal autopsy respondents.


METHODS
Countries with a recent history of cholera were classified as endemic or non-endemic, depending on whether they had reported cholera cases in at least three of the five most recent years.
The estimates of cholera cases in non-endemic countries were based on the average numbers of cases reported from 2000 to 2008.
Literature-based estimates of cholera case-fatality rates (CFRs) were used to compute the variance-weighted average cholera CFRs for estimating the number of cholera deaths.

FINDINGS
About 1.4 billion people are at risk for cholera in endemic countries.
The incidence is estimated to be greatest in children less than 5 years of age.
Every year about 91 000 people (uncertainty range: 28 000 to 142 000) die of cholera in endemic countries and 2500 people die of the disease in non-endemic countries.

CONCLUSION
The findings of this study provide a contemporary basis for planning public health interventions to control cholera.


Title
Practical measurement of affordability: an application to medicines.

METHODS
These methods are illustrated by calculating the affordability of glibenclamide, an antidiabetic drug, in India and Indonesia.

FINDINGS
When accurate aggregate data are available, the proposed methods offer a practical way to obtain informative and accurate estimates of affordability.

CONCLUSION
Their usefulness depends on the availability of accurate aggregated data.


LOCAL SETTING
Avian influenza is endemic in birds in Makassar.
Two of the city's 22 dilapidated, poorly-run bird markets were chosen for the study.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Market stakeholders' knowledge about the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus improved after the interventions.
WHO guideline recommendations for visual inspection, cleaning and poultry-holding practices, as well as infrastructural requirements for zoning and for water supply and utilities, began to conform to the WHO guideline.

LESSONS LEARNT
Combining infrastructural changes with behaviour change interventions was critical to guideline implementation.
This shift may enhance the sustainability of the interventions.


Title
Lessons from the 2009 influenza pandemic.

SETTING
The 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Modellers provided a quantitative framework for analysing surveillance data and for understanding the dynamics of the epidemic and the impact of interventions.

LESSONS LEARNT
Better communication between modellers and public health practitioners is needed to manage expectations, facilitate data sharing and interpretation and reduce inconsistency in results.


METHODS
These data were supplemented through literature reviews and with self-reported data supplied by the programmes themselves.

FINDINGS
In many low-and middle-income countries, ICT is being increasingly employed for different purposes in various health-related areas.
Of ICT-enabled health programmes, 42% use it to extend geographic access to health care, 38% to improve data management and 31% to facilitate communication between patients and physicians outside the physician's office.
Other purposes include improving diagnosis and treatment (17%), mitigating fraud and abuse (8%) and streamlining financial transactions (4%).
The most common devices used in technology-enabled programmes are phones and computers; 71% and 39% of programmes use them, respectively, and the most common applications are voice (34%), software (32%) and text messages (31%).
Donors are the primary funders of 47% of ICT-based health programmes.

CONCLUSION
Various types of ICT are being employed by private organizations to address key health system challenges.


METHODS
Nine long-running networks -those operating for five years or more -were identified and seven provided detailed information about their activities, including performance and scientific output.
Information was extracted from peer-reviewed papers describing the networks' study design, effectiveness, quality, economics, provision of access to care and sustainability.
The strength of the evidence was scored as none, poor, average or good.

FINDINGS
The seven networks had been operating for a median of 11 years (range: 5-15).
All networks provided clinical tele-consultations for humanitarian purposes using store-and-forward methods and five were also involved in some form of education.
The smallest network had 15 experts and the largest had more than 500.
The clinical caseload was 50 to 500 cases a year.
A total of 59 papers had been published by the networks, and 44 were listed in Medline.
Based on study design, the strength of the evidence was generally poor by conventional standards (e.g. 29 papers described non-controlled clinical series).
Over half of the papers provided evidence of sustainability and improved access to care.
Uncertain funding was a common risk factor.

CONCLUSION
Improved collaboration between networks could help attenuate the lack of resources reported by some networks and improve sustainability.
Although the evidence base is weak, the networks appear to offer sustainable and clinically useful services.
These findings may interest decision-makers in developing countries considering starting, supporting or joining similar telemedicine networks.


SETTING
The system did not allow for the early identification of outbreaks or unexpected increases in disease incidence.

RELEVANT CHANGES
An innovative case reporting system based on the use of cell phones was launched in March 2007.

LESSONS LEARNT
Madagascar's sentinel ILI surveillance system represents the country's first nationwide "real-time" surveillance system.
This type of syndromic surveillance can detect unexpected increases in the incidence of ILI and other syndromic illnesses.


METHODS
Data were obtained from household-based surveys in non-polio-endemic sub-Saharan African countries.
Routine immunization service users were children (aged < 5 years) who had ever had a health card containing their vaccination history; non-users were children who had never had a health card.
Users were considered compliant with the OPV routine immunization schedule if, by the SIA date, their health card reflected receipt of required OPV doses.
Logistic regression measured associations between SIA participation and use of both routine immunization services and compliance with routine OPV among users.

FINDINGS
Data from 21 SIAs conducted between 1999 and 2010 in 15 different countries met inclusion criteria.
Overall SIA participation ranged from 70.2% to 96.1%.
It was consistently lower among infants than among children aged 1-4 years.
In adjusted analyses, participation among routine immunization services users was > 85% in 12 SIAs but non-user participation was > 85% in only 5 SIAs.
In 18 SIAs, participation was greater among users (P < 0.01 in 16, 0.05 in 1 and < 0.10 in 1) than non-users.
In 14 SIAs, adjusted analyses revealed lower participation among non-compliant users than among compliant users (P < 0.01 in 10, < 0.05 in 2 and < 0.10 in 2).

CONCLUSION
Large percentages of children participated in SIAs.


METHODS
Potential reductions in CVD mortality in the United Kingdom between 2006 (baseline) and 2015 were estimated by synthesizing data on population, diet and mortality among adults aged 25 to 84 years.
The effect of specific dietary changes on CVD mortality was obtained from recent meta-analyses.
A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted.

FINDINGS
The first scenario would result in approximately 12 500 fewer CVD deaths per year (range: 5500-30300).
Approximately 4800 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and 1800 fewer deaths from stroke would occur among men, and 3500 and 2400 fewer, respectively, would occur among women.

CONCLUSION
Further improvements resembling those attained by other countries are achievable through stricter dietary policies.


METHODS
We adopted a central government perspective in estimating costs.
The relative costs of acts and regulations were estimated from the number of pages in the legislation.

FINDINGS
We estimated that, between 1999 and 2010, 26.7% of parliamentary resources and 16.7% of policy advice from government agencies were devoted to generating new laws in New Zealand.
For comparison, the average cost of a bill enacted by the 50 state governments in the United States of America between 2008 and 2009 was US$ 980 000.

CONCLUSION
We were able to estimate the cost of new legislation in New Zealand.
Our method for estimating this cost seemed to capture the main government costs involved and appears to be generally applicable to other developed countries.
Ideally such costs should be included in economic evaluations of public health interventions that involve new legislation.


Title
Chronic hepatitis C treatment outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of HCV treatment programmes in low- and middle-income countries.
The primary outcome was a sustained virological response (SVR).
Factors associated with treatment outcomes were identified by random-effects meta-regression analysis.

FINDINGS
The analysis involved data on 12 213 patients included in 93 studies from 17 countries.
The overall SVR rate was 52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 48-56).
For studies in which patients were predominantly infected with genotype 1 or 4 HCV, the pooled SVR rate was 49% (95% CI: 43-55).
This was significantly lower than the rate of 59% (95% CI: 54-64) found in studies in which patients were predominantly infected with other genotypes (P = 0.012).
Factors associated with successful outcomes included treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, infection with an HCV genotype other than genotype 1 or 4 and the absence of liver damage or human immunodeficiency virus infection at baseline.
No significant difference in the SVR rate was observed between weight-adjusted and fixed-dose ribavirin treatment.
Overall, 17% (95% CI: 13-23) of adverse events resulted in treatment interruption or dose modification, but only 4% (95% CI: 3-5) resulted in treatment discontinuation.


METHODS
Population surveillance data were used to identify children hospitalized between 1998 and 2006 with IPD caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes.

FINDINGS
The change in incidence in the eight surveillance areas varied from -37 to -82% for IPD caused by any serotype and from -96 to -100% for IPD caused by serotypes contained in PCV7.
All individual sentinel hospitals with more than three cases annually at baseline reported a decrease in cases by 2006.
The change in cases caused by PCV7 serotypes was accurately measured by 93% and 100% of sentinel systems with < 20 and > 20 cases annually at baseline, respectively.

CONCLUSION
Serotyping increases accuracy.


METHODS
The data were obtained from China's national infectious disease reporting system, national helminthiasis surveys and national water and sanitation surveys.

FINDINGS
In 2008, 327 million people in China lacked access to piped drinking water and 535 million lacked access to improved sanitation.
Per capita DALYs increased along an east-west gradient, with the highest burden in inland provinces having the lowest income per capita.

CONCLUSION
Despite remarkable progress, China still needs to conduct infrastructural improvement projects targeting provinces that have experienced slower economic development.


METHODS
Shortfall inequality was defined as the weighted average of the deviations of each country's average life expectancy by sex from the highest attained life expectancy by sex for each period.

FINDINGS
International shortfall inequalities in life expectancy among men and among women decreased between 1950 and 1975 but stagnated thereafter.
International shortfall inequality in life expectancy has been higher in women than in men, ranging from 1.9 to 2.9 years.
Women in low-income countries have the biggest shortfall, currently at around 26.7 years.

CONCLUSION
Further investigation is needed to determine the pathways causing these inequalities.


METHODS
Standard systematic review and meta-analysis methods were followed.
A definition of intervention was developed and standard inclusion criteria were followed in selecting studies.
Data were extracted from each eligible study, and a meta-analysis of the results was carried out.

FINDINGS
Six studies with a combined sample size of 23 048 met the inclusion criteria.
One was conducted in India and five in sub-Saharan Africa.
All studies were cross-sectional or serial cross-sectional.
Three studies had a comparison group, although all lacked equivalence in sociodemographic characteristics across study arms.
All studies randomly selected participants for assessments, although none randomly assigned participants to intervention arms.
The random-effects pooled odds ratio for condom use was 2.01 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.42-2.84) for the most recent sexual encounter and 2.10 (95% CI: 1.51-2.91) for a composite of all condom use outcomes.
Tests for heterogeneity yielded significant results for both meta-analyses.

CONCLUSION
The evidence base for the effect of condom social marketing on condom use is small because few rigorous studies have been conducted.
Meta-analyses showed a positive and statistically significant effect on increasing condom use, and all individual studies showed positive trends.
The cumulative effect of condom social marketing over multiple years could be substantial.
We strongly encourage more evaluations of these programmes with study designs of high rigour.


METHODS
Data were derived from the Fourth National Health Service Survey.
Logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.

FINDINGS
The rate of catastrophic health expenditure was 13.0%; that of impoverishment was 7.5%.
A combination of adverse factors increased the risk of catastrophic health expenditure.
Families enrolled in the urban employee or resident insurance schemes had lower rates of catastrophic health expenditure than those enrolled in the new rural corporative scheme.
The need for and use of health care, demographics, type of benefit package and type of provider payment method were the determinants of catastrophic health expenditure.

CONCLUSION
Although China has greatly expanded health insurance coverage, financial protection remains insufficient.


LOCAL SETTING
Thyolo district's 600 000 inhabitants are mostly subsistence-level or migrant farmers living in extreme poverty.
Health facilities include one public hospital and 38 primary health centres.
Understaffing and the absence of a radiologist make the diagnosis of tuberculosis difficult in a population where this disease affects 66% of patients with HIV infection.

RELEVANT CHANGES
From September 2010-2011, 159 images (from 158 patients) were reviewed by teleradiology.
Teleradiology changed patient management in 36 cases (23.5%).
Two (1.3%) of them were cases of pulmonary tuberculosis not previously suspected by clinical staff.
In addition, the radiologist's review corrected the misdiagnosis of tuberculosis and averted inappropriate treatment in 16 patients (10.5%).

LESSONS LEARNT
Designating a clinical focal point for teleradiology ensures sustainability.
Staff need time to adapt to a new teleradiology programme.


METHODS
Data on children aged < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia to a sentinel hospital in the western region were collected weekly.
Nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from a convenience sample of case patients for respiratory virus testing.
A health-care utilization survey was conducted in the hospital catchment area to determine the proportion of residents who sought care at the hospital.
The incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia among all Salvadorian children aged < 5 years was estimated from surveillance and census data, with adjustment for health-care utilization.
Influenza virus strains were characterized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine their correspondence with northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations.

FINDINGS
Physicians identified 2554 cases of severe pneumonia.
Samples from 608 cases were tested for respiratory viruses and 37 (6%) were positive for influenza virus.
Northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations matched influenza virus strains isolated during 2008 and 2010.

CONCLUSION
Influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia occurred frequently among young Salvadorian children during 2008-2010.
Antigens in northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations corresponded to circulating strains.


METHODS
A national sample of 192 communes located in 16 provinces and covering a population of approximately 2.6 million was selected using multi-stage cluster sampling.
Deaths for 2009 were identified from several local data sources.
Record reconciliation and capture-recapture methods were used to compile data and assess completeness of the records.
Life tables were computed using reported and adjusted age-specific death rates.
Each death was followed up by verbal autopsy to ascertain the probable cause(s) of death.
Underlying causes were certified and coded according to international guidelines.

FINDINGS
A total of 9921 deaths were identified in the sample population.
Completeness of death records was estimated to be 81%.
Adjusted life expectancies at birth were 70.4 and 78.7 years for males and females, respectively.
Stroke was the leading cause of death in both sexes.
Other prominent causes were road traffic accidents, cancers and HIV infection in males, and cardiovascular conditions, pneumonia and diabetes in females.

CONCLUSION
Viet Nam is undergoing the epidemiological transition.
Although data are relatively complete, they could be further improved through strengthened local collaboration.
Medical certification for deaths in hospitals, and shorter recall periods for verbal autopsy interviews would improve cause of death ascertainment.


METHODS
In 2009-2010, prospective studies with 28 days of follow-up were conducted at 25 sentinel sites.

FINDINGS
Overall, 1664 patients were enrolled.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed an efficacy of 98.8% for AS+SP.
Most patients with P. falciparum parasitaemia cleared their parasitaemias within 24 hours of treatment initiation, but six, including four with treatment failure, remained parasitaemic after 72 hours.
Double mutants in dhfr were found in 68.4% of the genotyped isolates.
Triple or quadruple mutants in dhfr and mutations in dhps were rare.
A daily dose of artesunate of < 3 mg per kg of body weight, age of less than 5 years, and fever at enrolment were associated with an increased risk of treatment failure.
Chloroquine remained 100% efficacious and generally cleared P. vivax parasitaemias within 48 hours.
Vomiting (seen in 47 patients) was the most common adverse event.

CONCLUSION
India's National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System provides wide coverage.
The first-line antimalarials used in the country remain safe and efficacious.
The treatment of malaria in young children and the relative benefits of age- and weight-based dosing need further exploration.


METHODS
Tailored search strings were used to search EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO.
The grey literature was identified through online grey literature databases.
Experts were consulted to obtain additional studies and data.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).

FINDINGS
Sixty-seven cohorts of people who inject drugs were identified, 14 of them from low- and middle-income countries.
The pooled CMR was 2.35 deaths per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.12-2.58).
SMRs were reported for 32 cohorts; the pooled SMR was 14.68 (95% CI: 13.01-16.35).
It was also higher during off-treatment periods.
Drug overdose and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were the primary causes of death across cohorts.

CONCLUSION
Compared with the general population, people who inject drugs have an elevated risk of death, although mortality rates vary across different settings.


METHODS
Two rural counties/districts in each of three provinces where NEMS had been implemented were surveyed.
Information was collected from NEMS staff at the province, county/district, township and village levels; patients with chronic disease were also interviewed.
The results were compared with the corresponding data recorded before NEMS was introduced.

FINDINGS
Following the introduction of NEMS, drug procurement in each study location was systematized.
Total drug costs declined.
This, and improved prescribing, reduced the costs of outpatient and inpatient care and led, apparently, to increased uptake of health services.
However, the prices of some drugs had increased and the availability of others had declined.
The compensation of health-care providers for NEMS-related reductions in their incomes had been largely ineffective.
As a result of the introduction of NEMS, health facilities relied more on public financing.
Many health-care providers complained about higher workloads and lower incomes.

CONCLUSION
Although it was well conceived, the introduction of NEMS into China's decentralized, fee-for-service system of health care has not been straightforward.
It has highlighted the problems associated with attempts to modernize health care and health financing for patients' benefit.
Sustainable mechanisms to compensate health-care providers for lost income are needed to ensure that NEMS is a success.


METHODS
Data on 484 obstetric emergencies (242 deaths and 242 near-misses) were collected in 2008-2011.
Catastrophic expenditure for emergency obstetric care was assessed at different thresholds and its associated factors were explored through logistic regression.
A survey was subsequently administered in a nested sample of 56 households to determine how the catastrophic expenditure had affected them.

FINDINGS
Despite the fee exemption policy for Caesareans and the maternity referral-system, designed to reduce the financial burden of emergency obstetric care, average expenses were 152 United States dollars (equivalent to 71 535 Communauté Financière Africaine francs) and 20.7 to 53.5% of households incurred catastrophic expenditures.
High expenditure for emergency obstetric care forced 44.6% of the households to reduce their food consumption and 23.2% were still indebted 10 months to two and a half years later.
Living in remote rural areas was associated with the risk of catastrophic spending, which shows the referral system's inability to eliminate financial obstacles for remote households.
Women who underwent Caesareans continued to incur catastrophic expenses, especially when prescribed drugs not included in the government-provided Caesarean kits.

CONCLUSION
The poor accessibility and affordability of emergency obstetric care has consequences beyond maternal deaths.


METHODS
PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Libraries were searched for literature assessing adverse pregnancy outcomes among untreated women with seroreactivity for Treponema pallidum infection and non-seroreactive women.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes were fetal loss or stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity or low birth weight, clinical evidence of syphilis and infant death.
Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled estimates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and, where appropriate, heterogeneity was explored in group-specific analyses.

FINDINGS
Of the 3258 citations identified, only six, all case-control studies, were included in the analysis.
Pooled estimates showed that among untreated pregnant women with syphilis, fetal loss and stillbirth were 21% more frequent, neonatal deaths were 9.3% more frequent and prematurity or low birth weight were 5.8% more frequent than among women without syphilis.
Of the infants of mothers with untreated syphilis, 15% had clinical evidence of congenital syphilis.
The single study that estimated infant death showed a 10% higher frequency among infants of mothers with syphilis.

CONCLUSION
Untreated maternal syphilis is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.


METHODS
The Medline, Embase and Cinahl databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles examining the effect of TFA policies.
In addition, the first 20 pages of Google searches were examined for articles from the grey literature.

FINDINGS
Twenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria: 5 involved voluntary self-regulation; 8, labelling alone; 4, labelling and voluntary limits; 5, local bans and 4, national bans.
Overall, the TFA content of food decreased with all types of policy intervention.
In general, saturated fat levels increased or decreased, depending on the product type, and total fat content remained stable.

CONCLUSION
Such policies are feasible, achievable and likely to have an effect on public health.


LOCAL SETTING
The prevalence of HIV infection among people injecting drugs was 24.5% in Manipur and 8.4% in Nagaland.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Opioid agonist maintenance treatment coverage was 13.7% and retention 6 months after enrolment was 63%.
Antiretroviral treatment coverage for HIV-positive participants was 81%.

LESSONS LEARNT
Project ORCHID has influenced national harm reduction policy in India and contributed to the development of harm reduction guidelines.


METHODS
Age-specific smoking prevalence among cohorts born between 1897 and 1985 were determined for the period 1949-2010.
The percentages of the cohorts born between 1893 and 1979 who initiated smoking early (e.g. before the age of 20 years) were determined.
The results were compared against lung cancer mortality rates in people aged 40-84 years belonging to cohorts born between 1868 and 1968.

FINDINGS
In males, smoking prevalence was generally high, particularly among those born before the late 1950s, and early initiation was fairly uncommon.
Early initiation was most common among recent birth cohorts of males, who showed relatively low prevalences of smoking.
In females, the prevalence of smoking was generally low and early initiation was very uncommon, particularly among those born in the late 1930s and before the late 1940s, respectively.
Recent cohorts of females showed relatively high prevalences of smoking and relatively high percentages of early initiation.
In both sexes, lung cancer mortality was generally low but increased over the study period.

CONCLUSION
Over the last four decades, however, early initiation of smoking has become more common in both sexes.


METHODS
This population-based, retrospective cohort study included data on 598 305 singleton, term (i.e. > 37 weeks' gestation) and vertex-presenting vaginal births between 2001 and 2010.
Data were obtained from linked, validated, population-level birth and hospitalization data sets.
Contingency tables and multivariate analysis were used to compare risk factors and pregnancy outcomes in women who did or did not have an episiotomy.

FINDINGS
The episiotomy rate in 12 208 Vietnamese-born women was 29.9%, compared with 15.1% in Australian-born women.
In these women, having an episiotomy was associated with postpartum haemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 1.26; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.08-1.46) and postnatal hospitalization for more than 4 days (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00-1.29).
Among multiparous women only, episiotomy was positively associated with a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear (aOR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.31-3.06); in contrast, among primiparous women the association was negative (aOR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.37-0.60).

CONCLUSION
A lower episiotomy rate should be achievable in Viet Nam.


METHODS
An analysis was conducted of the number of countries that guarantee breastfeeding breaks, the daily number of hours guaranteed, and the duration of guarantees.
To obtain current, detailed information on national policies, original legislation as well as secondary sources on 182 of the 193 Member States of the United Nations were examined.

FINDINGS
Breastfeeding breaks with pay are guaranteed in 130 countries (71%) and unpaid breaks are guaranteed in seven (4%).
No policy on breastfeeding breaks exists in 45 countries (25%).
In multivariate models, the guarantee of paid breastfeeding breaks for at least 6 months was associated with an increase of 8.86 percentage points in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (P < 0.05).

CONCLUSION
A greater percentage of women practise exclusive breastfeeding in countries where laws guarantee breastfeeding breaks at work.


METHODS
A retrospective, cross-sectional, nationwide multicentre study was conducted between 2008 and 2010 in 28 public clinics in 20 Brazilian cities.
The study included 3180 patients with T1DM (mean age 22 years ± 11.8) who were surveyed while receiving health care from the NBHCS.
The mean duration of their diabetes was 10.3 years (± 8.0).
The costs of tests and medical procedures, insulin pumps, and supplies for administration, and supplies for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) were obtained from national and local health system sources for 2010-2011.
Annual direct medical costs were derived by adding the costs of medications, supplies, tests, medical consultations, procedures and hospitalizations over the year preceding the interview.

FINDINGS
The average annual direct medical cost per capita was 1319.15 United States dollars (US$).

CONCLUSION
Health technologies accounted for most direct medical costs of T1DM.


METHODS
A panel of four slides was delivered to diagnostic laboratories in all provinces of the country.
The slides contained: (i) Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes; (ii) P. falciparum trophozoites (reference density: 113 530 per µl); (iii) Trypanosoma brucei subspecies; and (iv) no parasites.

FINDINGS
Of 356 laboratories contacted, 277 (77.8%) responded.
Overall, 35.0% of the laboratories reported all four slides correctly but 14.1% reported correct results for 1 or 0 slides.
Major errors included not diagnosing trypanosomiasis (50.4%), not recognizing P. falciparum gametocytes (17.5%) and diagnosing malaria from the slide with no parasites (19.0%).
The frequency of serious errors in assessing parasite density and in reporting false-positive results was lower than in the previous external quality assessment: 17.2% and 52.3%, respectively, (P < 0.001) for parasite density and 19.0% and 33.3%, respectively, (P < 0.001) for false-positive results.
Laboratories that participated in the previous quality assessment performed better than first-time participants and laboratories in provinces with a high number of sleeping sickness cases recognized trypanosomes more frequently (57.0% versus 31.2%, P < 0.001).
Malaria rapid diagnostic tests were used by 44.3% of laboratories, almost double the proportion observed in the previous quality assessment.

CONCLUSION
The overall quality of blood film microscopy was poor but was improved by participation in external quality assessments.
The failure to recognize trypanosomes in a country where sleeping sickness is endemic is a concern.


METHODS
Data on 3535 HIV-positive pregnant women who were enrolled into the Ukraine European Collaborative Study in 2008-2010 were analysed.

FINDINGS
cART coverage increased significantly, from 22% of deliveries in 2008 to 61% of those in 2010.
Compared with AZTm, cART was associated with a 70% greater reduction in the risk of MTCT (adjusted odds ratio: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16-0.56).

CONCLUSION
Between 2008 and 2010, access to antenatal cART improved substantially in Ukraine, but implementation of the World Health Organization's Option-B policy was slow.


METHODS
A search was conducted for all country surveys reporting data on health expenditure and total household expenditure.
Data on total expenditure and health expenditure were extracted from the surveys to generate the health expenditure share (i.e. fraction of the household expenditure devoted to health).
To do this the authors relied on survey microdata or survey reports to calculate the health expenditure share for the particular instrument involved.
Health expenditure share was modelled as a function of the survey's recall period, the number of health expenditure items, the number of total expenditure items, the data collection method and the placement of the health module within the survey.
Data exists across space and time, so fixed effects for territory and year were included as well.
The model was estimated by means of ordinary least squares regression with clustered standard errors.

FINDINGS
Increasing the recall period by one month was accompanied by a 6% decrease in the health expenditure share.

CONCLUSION
The characteristics of a survey instrument examined in the study affect the estimate of the health expenditure share.


METHODS
Robust linear models were then fitted to the rates of mortality from respiratory disease recorded between 2003 and 2009.

FINDINGS
Between 1998 and 2008, rates of mortality from respiratory disease gradually decreased in all age groups in most of the study areas.
Among children younger than 5 years, for example, the annual rates of such mortality - across all seven study areas - fell from 56.9 deaths per 100 000 in 1998 to 26.6 deaths per 100 000 in 2008.
Over this period, rates of mortality from respiratory disease were generally highest among adults older than 65 years and lowest among individuals aged 5 to 49 years.

CONCLUSION
In much of Latin America, mortality from respiratory disease gradually fell between 1998 and 2008.


Methods
A cross-sectional mortuary-based study was conducted in a national sample of 38 medicolegal laboratories operating in 2009.
These were sampled in inverse proportion to the number that were operational in each of three strata defined by autopsy volume: < 500, 500–1499 or > 1499 annual autopsies.
Child homicide data were collected from mortuary files, autopsy reports and police interviews.
Cause of death, evidence of abuse and neglect or of sexual assault, perpetrator characteristics and circumstances surrounding the death were investigated.

Findings
An estimated 1018 (95% confidence interval, CI: 843–1187) child homicides occurred in 2009, for a rate of 5.5 (95% CI: 4.6–6.4) homicides per 100 000 children younger than 18 years.
The homicide rate was much higher in boys (6.9 per 100 000; 95% CI: 5.6–8.3) than in girls (3.9 per 100 000; 95% CI: 3.2–4.7).
Child abuse and neglect had preceded nearly half (44.5%) of all homicides, but three times more often among girls than among boys.
In children aged 15 to 17 years, the homicide rate among boys (21.7 per 100 000; 95% CI: 14.2–29.2) was nearly five times higher than the homicide rate among girls (4.6 per 100 000; 95% CI: 2.4–6.8).

Conclusion
South Africa's child homicide rate is more than twice the global estimate.


Methods
Microcosting methods were used to guide data collection on the use of resources (i.e. staff, supplies and equipment) and data were obtained from government, demonstration project and health centre administrative records.
Delivery costs were expressed in 2009 United States dollars (US$).
Exclusively project-related expenses and the cost of the vaccine were excluded.

Findings
The economic delivery cost per vaccine dose ranged from US$ 1.44 for integrated outreach in Uganda to US$ 3.88 for school-based delivery in Peru.
In Viet Nam, the lowest cost per dose was US$ 1.92 for health-centre-based delivery.
Cost profiles revealed that, in general, the largest contributing factors were project start-up costs and recurrent personnel costs.
The delivery cost of HPV vaccine was higher than published costs for traditional vaccines recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).

Conclusion
The cost per vaccine dose was lower when delivery was integrated into existing health services.


Methods
The main outcomes of interest were rates of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs), primarily postpartum depression or anxiety; measures of the quality of the mother–infant relationship; and measures of infant or child health, growth and cognitive development.
Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a summary measure of the clinical effectiveness of the interventions.

Findings
Thirteen trials representing 20 092 participants were identified.
In all studies, supervised, non-specialist health and community workers delivered the interventions, which proved more beneficial than routine care for both mothers and children.
The pooled effect size for maternal depression was −0.38 (95% confidence interval: −0.56 to −0.21; I 2 = 79.9%).
Where assessed, benefits to the child included improved mother–infant interaction, better cognitive development and growth, reduced diarrhoeal episodes and increased immunization rates.

Conclusion
In LAMI countries, the burden of CPMDs can be reduced through mental health interventions delivered by supervised non-specialists.


Title
Global mortality trends and patterns in older women.

Methods
Projections of trends in mortality, by cause, at older ages were also made.

Findings
In both developed and developing countries, the leading causes of death among older women were cardiovascular diseases and cancers.
If these trends continue, deaths in older women are still expected to increase in number because of population growth and ageing.

Conclusion
Health systems must adjust accordingly, perhaps by drawing on lessons from high-income countries that have succeeded in reducing mortality from noncommunicable diseases.


Methods
The mean number of risk factors per woman was estimated.
Their independent demographic and socioeconomic covariates were also examined with ordinal logistic regression.

Findings
The following prevalences were found: insufficient intake of fruit and vegetables, 51.7%; overweight and obesity, 32.3%; raised blood pressure, 29.7%; physical inactivity, 18.3%; raised total serum cholesterol, 18.1%; raised blood glucose, 7.0%; current smoking, 2.4%; and harmful use of alcohol, 1.3%.
The mean number of risk factors per woman was 1.61; 48.0% of the women had at least two risk factors.

Conclusion
Risk factors for chronic NCDs are common among Chinese women aged 18 or older.


Methods
The Short Form (36) Health Survey was used to measure physical functioning (score 1–100).
The disability threshold was the mean physical functioning score in older women requiring assistance with daily activities (62.8).
The relationship between age and physical functioning was modelled using spline regression for the entire sample, and by baseline physical functioning quintile and physical activity level.

Findings
Physical decline quickened with age: 0.05 annual units (95% confidence interval, CI: −0.13 to 0.22) at ages 18–23 years (i.e. no decline); –2.43 (95% CI: −2.64 to −2.23) at ages 82–90 years.
The disability threshold was reached at a mean age of 79 years, but the range was 45–88 years, depending on baseline physical functioning and physical activity.

Conclusion
Age and physical decline are not linearly related, as traditionally believed; decline accelerates with age.


Local setting
The country's integrated response to infectious diseases has resulted in steep declines in premature mortality over the past decade.

Relevant changes
In 2011–2012, Rwanda vaccinated 227 246 girls with all three doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Among eligible girls, three-dose coverage rates of 93.2% and 96.6% were achieved in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
The country has also initiated nationwide screening and treatment programmes that are based on visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid, testing for HPV DNA, cryotherapy, the loop electrosurgical excision procedure and various advanced treatment options.

Lessons learnt
Low-income countries should begin to address cervical cancer by integrating prevention, screening and treatment into routine women's health services.
This requires political will, cross-sectoral collaboration and planning, innovative partnerships and robust monitoring and evaluation.


Methods
All but the NSS 2004–05 and the NSS 2009–10 used different questionnaires.

Findings
CHE estimates from WHS 2003 and SAGE 2007–08 were twice as high as those from NSS 2004–05, NSS 2009–10 and NSS 2004.

Conclusion
The wide variations observed in CHE and OOP payment estimates resulted from methodological differences.


Approach
To ensure service accessibility, financial risk protection schemes were expanded.

Local setting
In Thailand, district hospitals were practically non-existent in the 1960s.
Expansion of primary health care (PHC), especially in poor rural areas, was considered essential for attaining universal health coverage (UHC).
Nationwide reforms led to important changes in a few decades.

Relevant changes
Over the past 30 years, the availability and distribution of health workers, as well as their skills and competencies, have greatly improved, along with national health indicators.
Between 1980 and 2000 coverage with maternal and child health services increased substantially.
By 2002, Thailand had attained UHC.
Overall health system development, particularly an expanded health workforce, resulted in a functioning PHC system.

Lessons learnt
A competent, committed health workforce helped strengthen the PHC system at the district level.


Methods
In each of 10 states, the largest district and the one most distant from the state capital were selected for study.
Four boxes, each containing an electronic temperature recorder and two vials of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine, were placed in the state or regional vaccine store for each study state.
Two of these boxes were then shipped – one per facility – towards the two most peripheral health facilities where vaccine was stored in each study district.
The boxes were shipped, handled and stored as if they were routine vaccine supplies.

Findings
The boxes also spent about 18% and 7% of their combined times in transit at < 0 and > 8 °C, respectively.
In shake tests conducted at the end of the study, two thirds of the vaccine vials in the boxes showed evidence of freezing.

Conclusion
Systematic efforts are needed to improve temperature monitoring in the cold-chain system in India.


Methods
An interrupted time series analysis was conducted and segmented regression analysis was used to assess the immediate and gradual effects of the intervention on hospitalization rates in an intervention group composed of rural residents and a comparison group composed of urban residents primarily.

Findings
Before the intervention, the hospitalization rate in the rural population was significantly lower than in the comparison group.
The monthly increase in the hospitalization rate continued for over a year and stabilized thereafter.
No increase in the hospitalization rate was observed in the comparison group.

Conclusion
It has not reduced hospitalizations or hospitalization-related expenditure.


Local setting
Rapid monitoring was implemented in camps located in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area.
Camps that housed more than 5000 people were monitored first.

Relevant changes
By the end of March 2010, 72 (23%) of the 310 vaccinated camps had been monitored.

Lessons learnt
Rapid monitoring was only marginally beneficial in achieving immunization targets in the temporary camps in Port-au-Prince.


Approach
In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed and tested two formulations for ABHs that were suitable for production in health-care facilities.

Relevant changes
Local production of one of the WHO formulations was feasible in every participating site.
Twenty-one (54%) of the sites had replaced a previously used ABH with one of the WHO formulations.
In 32 sites, the WHO formulation that had been produced was well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.
The WHO formulations were found to be less expensive than marketed ABHs.
Barriers to local production included difficulty in identifying staff with adequate skills, the need for staff training, and constraints in ingredient and dispenser procurement.

Lessons learnt
The WHO formulations can be easily produced locally at low cost.
They are well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.


Methods
A systematic search identified nationally representative health examination surveys from 20 countries containing data from 1980 to 2011 on blood pressure measurements, the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and its control with antihypertensive drugs.
For each country, the prevalence of hypertension (i.e. systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or antihypertensive use) and the proportion of hypertensive individuals whose condition was diagnosed, treated or controlled with medications (i.e. systolic pressure < 140 mmHg) were estimated.

Findings
The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension varied between countries: for individuals aged 35 to 49 years, it ranged from around 12% in Bangladesh, Egypt and Thailand to around 30% in Armenia, Lesotho and Ukraine; for those aged 35 to 84 years, it ranged from 20% in Bangladesh to more than 40% in Germany, the Russian Federation and Turkey.
The age-standardized percentage of hypertensive individuals whose condition was diagnosed, treated or controlled was highest in the United States of America: for those aged 35 to 49 years, it was 84%, 77% and 56%, respectively.
Percentages were especially low in Albania, Armenia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey.
Although recent trends in prevalence differed in England, Japan and the United States, treatment coverage and hypertension control improved over time, particularly in England.

Conclusion
Greater efforts are needed to improve hypertension control, which would reduce the burden of noncommunicable diseases.


Methods
Modified Poisson regressions were used to estimate relative risks (RRs).

Findings
At the time of the survey, nearly 40% of Chinese people aged 45 years or older had a hypertensive disorder.
Of the individuals with hypertension, more than 40% were unaware of their condition, about 50% were receiving no medication for it and about 80% were not controlling it well.

Conclusion
A reduction in the costs of outpatient care to patients would probably improve the management of hypertension in China.


Methods
The possible mediating effect of annual per capita intake of soft drinks, animal fats and total calories on the association between fast food consumption and BMI was also analysed.
Two-stage least squares regression models were conducted, using economic freedom as an instrumental variable, to study the causal effect of fast food consumption on BMI.

Findings
After adjustment for covariates, each 1-unit increase in annual fast food transactions per capita was associated with an increase of 0.033 kg/m2 in age-standardized BMI (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.013–0.052).
Only the intake of soft drinks – not animal fat or total calories – mediated the observed association (β: 0.030; 95% CI: 0.010–0.050).
Economic freedom was an independent predictor of fast food consumption (β: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.16–0.37).
When economic freedom was used as an instrumental variable, the association between fast food and BMI weakened but remained significant (β: 0.023; 95% CI: 0.001–0.045).

Conclusion
Fast food consumption is an independent predictor of mean BMI in high-income countries.


Methods
Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria.
Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated.
Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed.

Findings
Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34 706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific).
Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up.
Pre-treatment loss to follow-up varied from 4 to 38% and was common in studies from Africa (random-effects weighted proportion, WP: 18%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 13–22) and Asia (WP: 13%; 95% CI: 10–15).

Conclusion
Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts.


Approach
Clinical “dashboards” based on locally available data offer a way of providing accurate and timely information.
A dashboard is a simple computerized tool that presents a health facility's clinical data graphically using a traffic-light coding system to alert front-line staff about changes in the frequency of clinical outcomes.
It provides rapid feedback on local outcomes in an accessible form and enables problems to be detected early.
Until now, dashboards have been used only in high-resource settings.

Local setting
A midwife at the hospital was trained to collect and input data monthly.

Relevant changes
Implementation of the maternity dashboards was feasible and 28 months of clinical outcome data were summarized using common computer software.
Presentation of these data to staff led to the rapid identification of adverse trends in outcomes and to suggestions for actions to improve health-care quality.

Lessons learnt
Active participation of hospital management and midwifery staff was crucial to their success.


Methods
A household survey (n = 5597 households) was conducted in Gujarat to collect retrospective data on births within the preceding 5 years.
In an observational study using a difference-in-differences design, the relationship between the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme and the probability of delivery in health-care institutions, the probability of obstetric complications and mean household expenditure for deliveries was subsequently examined.
In multivariate regressions, individual and household characteristics as well as district and year fixed effects were controlled for.
Data from the most recent District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3) wave conducted in Gujarat (n = 6484 households) were used in parallel analyses.

Findings
Between 2005 and 2010, the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of institutional delivery (2.42 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI: −5.90 to 10.74) or of birth-related complications (6.16 percentage points; 95% CI: −2.63 to 14.95).
Estimates using DLHS-3 data were similar.
Analyses of household expenditures indicated that mean household expenditure for private-sector deliveries had either not fallen or had fallen very little under the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme.

Conclusion
The absence of estimated reductions in household spending for private-sector deliveries deserves further study.


Methods
Clinic characteristics were collected from staff via questionnaires.
Determinants of bypassing (i.e. delivery of the youngest child at a health centre or hospital without provider referral) were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.
Bypasser and non-bypasser birth experiences were compared in bivariate analyses.

Findings
Of 3019 eligible women interviewed (93% response rate), 71.0% (2144) delivered in a health facility; 41.8% (794) were bypassers.
Bypassers reported better quality of care on six of seven quality of care measures.

Conclusion
Many pregnant women, especially first-time mothers, choose to bypass local primary care clinics for childbirth.
Perceived poor quality of care at clinics was an important reason for bypassing.


Approach
By 2008, the target coverage was 80% of households and the Global Fund had financed a phased scale-up of LLIN distribution in the region.

Local setting
South Sudan’s entire population is considered to be at risk of malaria.

Relevant changes
By 2012, approximately 8.0 million LLINs had been distributed in South Sudan.
The number of recorded malaria cases increased from 71 948 in 2008 to 1 198 357 in 2012.


Approach
In partnership with a medical school in the United States of America, a multidisciplinary Cancer Control Research Training Institute was developed at the Instituto de Cancerología (INCAN) in Guatemala City.
This institute provided a year-long training programme for clinicians that focused on research methods in population health and sociocultural anthropology.

Local setting
INCAN is thus a resource for capacity building within the context of cancer prevention and control.

Relevant changes
Trainees increased their self-efficacy for the design and conduct of research.
Value-added benefits included establishment of an annual cancer seminar and workshops in cancer pathology and qualitative analysis.
INCAN has recently incorporated some of the programme’s components into its residency training and established a research department.

Lessons learnt
A training programme for clinicians can build cancer research capacity in low- and middle-income countries.
Training in population-based research methods will enable countries such as Guatemala to gather country-specific data.


Title
An evaluation of subsidies for maternal health care in Cambodia.

Findings
Both types of schemes increased the probability of receiving postnatal care, but the increase was significant only for non-poor women.
Universal, but not targeted, voucher schemes significantly increased the probability of receiving antenatal care.

Conclusion
Voucher schemes increased deliveries in health centres and, to a lesser extent, improved antenatal and postnatal care.


Approach
The scheme operates at the county level and offers a modest benefit package.

Local setting
In spite of rapid economic growth since the early 1980s, income disparities in China have increased, particularly between rural and urban populations.
In response, the government has put greater emphasis on social development, including health system development.
Examples are the prioritization of improved access to health services and the reduction of the burden of payment for necessary services.

Relevant changes
After 10 years of implementation, the RCMS now provides coverage to the entire rural population and has substantially improved access to health care.

Lessons learnt
Further improving the RCMS will require a focus on cost containment, quality improvement and making the scheme portable.


Methods
The height, body weight and physical activity level of children and adolescents aged 18 years and under, as well as dietary data, were obtained from seven large surveys conducted in China between 1975 and 2010.
Chinese economic development indicators were obtained from the World Bank.
Trends in body weight, height, economic data and diet were examined.
Tests were conducted to check for correlations between height at 17 years of age and three indicators of economic development: gross domestic product, urbanization and infant mortality rate.
Regional differences in physical growth were assessed.

Findings
Between 1975 and 2010, the growth of children and adolescents improved in tandem with economic development.
The largest increment in height was observed during the period of puberty.
Regional inequalities in nutritional status were correlated with disparities in economic development among regions.
Over the past two decades, undernutrition declined among children less than 5 years of age, but in 2010 underweight and stunting were still common in poor rural areas.
A large increase in obesity was observed in both urban and rural areas, but especially in large cities and, more recently, in small and medium-sized cities and affluent rural areas.

Conclusion
The average weight of children and adolescents has been increasing progressively since the 1970s.


Title
Arsenic exposure in drinking water: an unrecognized health threat in Peru.

Methods
The EQ field kit was validated by comparing a subset of 139 water samples analysed by laboratory measurements and the EQ kit.

Findings
In 86% (96/111) of the groundwater samples, arsenic exceeded the 10 µg/l arsenic concentration guideline given by the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water.

Conclusion
In several districts of Peru, drinking water shows widespread arsenic contamination, exceeding the WHO arsenic guideline.
This poses a public health threat requiring further investigation and action.


Methods
Cambodia’s first population-based nationwide tuberculosis survey, based on multistage cluster sampling, was conducted in 2002.

Findings
Of the 40 423 eligible subjects, 37 417 (92.6%) participated in the survey; 103 smear-positive cases and 211 smear-negative, culture-positive cases were identified.
The weighted prevalences of smear-positive tuberculosis and bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 271 (95% confidence interval, CI: 212–348) and 831 (95% CI: 707–977) per 100 000 population, respectively.
Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in men than women and increased with age.
A 38% decline in smear-positive tuberculosis (P = 0.0085) was observed with respect to the 2002 survey, after participants were matched by demographic and geographical characteristics.
The prevalence of symptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by 56% (P = 0.001), whereas the prevalence of asymptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by only 7% (P = 0.7249).

Conclusion
The tuberculosis burden in Cambodia has declined significantly, most probably because of the decentralization of DOTS to health centres.


Methods
Varicella vaccination coverage for children born between 2001 and 2009 was obtained from the Australian Childhood Immunization Register.
Principal or any coded varicella or HZ hospitalizations were retrieved from the national hospital morbidity database from 1998 to 2010.
Trends in hospitalization rates in different age groups and indigenous status were assessed.
Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated between periods before and after implementation of immunization programme funding.

Findings
In the first year of the funded immunization programme, varicella vaccine coverage reached 75% in children aged 24 months and more than 80% in children aged 60 months.
Compared with the pre-vaccine period, varicella hospitalization rates during the funded programme were significantly lower for age groups younger than 40 years; with the greatest reduction in children aged 18–59 months (IRR: 0.25; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.22–0.29).
Indigenous children had a higher varicella hospitalization rate compared with non-indigenous children before vaccine implementation (IRR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4–2.7), but afterwards reached equivalence (IRR: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7–1.6).
The age-standardized HZ hospitalization rate declined between the periods (IRR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92–0.97).

Conclusion
This suggests high one-dose varicella vaccine coverage can have a substantial impact on severe disease.


Methods
Pregnant women were enrolled and followed until six weeks postpartum.

Findings
Between 2010 and 2012, 214 070 of 220 235 enrolled women (97.2%) completed follow-up.
The maternal mortality ratio was 168 per 100 000 live births, ranging from 69 per 100 000 in Argentina to 316 per 100 000 in Pakistan.
Overall, 29% (98/336) of maternal deaths occurred around the time of delivery: most were attributed to haemorrhage (86/336), pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (55/336) or sepsis (39/336).
Around 70% (4349/6213) of stillbirths were probably intrapartum; 34% (1804/5230) of neonates died on the day of delivery and 14% (755/5230) died the day after.
Stillbirths were more common in women who died than in those alive six weeks postpartum (risk ratio, RR: 9.48; 95% confidence interval, CI: 7.97–11.27), as were perinatal deaths (RR: 4.30; 95% CI: 3.26–5.67) and 7-day (RR: 3.94; 95% CI: 2.74–5.65) and 28-day neonatal deaths (RR: 7.36; 95% CI: 5.54–9.77).

Conclusion
Maternal death increased the risk of perinatal and neonatal death.
Improving obstetric and neonatal care around the time of birth offers the greatest chance of reducing mortality.


Approach
A pilot implementation study was conducted in two Brazilian cities to explore the replacement of sputum smear microscopy with Xpert.
The laboratories included covered 70% of the tuberculosis cases diagnosed, had no overlap in population catchment areas, handled different workloads and were randomly shifted to Xpert.
Sputum samples were collected through the same routine procedures.
Before the study the medical information system was prepared for the recording of Xpert results.
Laboratory technicians were trained to operate Xpert machines and health workers were taught how to interpret the results.

Relevant changes
Of the tested sputum samples, 7.3% were too scanty for Xpert and had to be examined microscopically.
Ten per cent of Xpert equipment needed replacement, but spare parts were not readily available in the country.
Absence of patient identification numbers led to the introduction of errors in the medical information system.

Lessons learnt
For nationwide scale-up, a local service provider is needed to maintain the Xpert system.
Ensuring cartridge availability is also essential.
The capacity to perform smear microscopy should be retained.
The medical information system needs updating to allow efficient use of Xpert.


INTRODUCTION
The treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis is a controversial subject.
The aim of present research was to demonstrate the effectiveness of surgical treatment in cases of lumbar canal stenosis in patients operated on by recalibration techniques, laminectomy, instrumentation and fusion from January to December, 2008.

METHODS
A prospective and descriptive study was conducted on surgical treatment in rachidial lumbar canal stenosis in patients operated on in “Fructuoso Rodríguez” Orthopedics Hospital from January to December, 2008.
The choice of the type of surgery was determined by the stenotic specific anatomic area of vertebral canal.
Significant variables were analyzed to define the feasibility to apply each surgical procedure.

RESULTS
There was a marked improvement in patients presenting with neurogenic claudication, with a Oswestry’s rate of 62,7 decreasing to 22,1.
In patients with lumbar back pain Oswestry’s rate decreased from 77,1 to 15,1.

CONCLUSIONS
Techniques used for central stenosis included laminectomy with instrumentation and for lateral recess stenosis we used the recalibration technique described by Senegas.


INTRODUCTION
At 2008 the TRAUSON system was used for the first time in “Fructuoso Rodríguez” Orthopedics Hospital originating in China.
The aim of present article was to shows the results obtained with this technique for treatment of 6 patients presenting with lumbosacral spine affection.

METHODS
We made a review of medical records and imaging studies from patients with lumbosacral fusion using the TRAUSON system from April, 2008 to 2009.
During this period 18 instrumentations were performed, where six included the L5-S1 segment (control group).
Preoperative and postoperative clinical picture were correlated with the available imaging studies.
Following data were analyzed: sex, age, baseline pathology, surgical time and satisfaction level according the EVA and Oswestry scales.

RESULTS
In the 100% of cases the course was good if we considered that first symptoms causing surgery were overcome.
Five patients had residual pain in sacroiliac joint improving between the second and the third month with physiotherapy.
Neither infiltrations nor other invasive methods were used.

CONCLUSIONS
This system is very well accepted by patients.


INTRODUCTION
Spondylotic myelopathy is a common disease representing the fourth part of non-traumatic paraparesis and tetraparesis.
Its diagnosis is supported by clinical, radiological and neurophysiological data.

METHODS
Thirty patients of both sexes were assessed by clinical and imaging diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
All of them underwent electromyography, nervous conduction study, F wave, somatosensory and motor evoked potentials.
Techniques of descriptive statistics were applied to neurophysiological variables correlating them with the medullary compression degree according to resonance.

RESULTS
In most of the cases the evoked potentials were altered.
The electromyography demonstrated altered results in all the cases: in the 72,7% there was a diffuse neurogenic pattern, whereas remained showed a radicular irritation pattern.
In the 52,1% of cases there were moderate to severe alterations in the study of medium nerve conduction.
A significant statistical correlation was present between the abnormality of electrophysiological parameters and the medullary compression intensity observed in resonance images.


INTRODUCTION
The objective of present research was to demonstrate the effectiveness of such protocol and to establish the validity of the proposed pattern.

RESULTS
Maximal age was of 94 years and the minimal one was of 56 years.

CONCLUSIONS
The suggested behavior pattern had positive results in more than 20 years of use.


INTRODUCTION
The scapulothoracic friction syndrome is a pain cause in the posterior area of the shoulder and that may be provoked by a dysfunction of this joint.
When conservative treatment fails or when it is due to tumor injuries, surgical treatment is prescribed.
The aim of present paper is to assess the results obtained with this type of treatment in our study group.

METHODS
An intervention study was conducted in 17 patients with a scapulothoracic friction syndrome operated on the Upper Member Service of the "Frank País" International Orthopedics Scientific Complex from March, 2002 to March, 2008.
Surgical technique was in correspondence with the triggering cause of this syndrome.

RESULTS
Assessment of pain, function, flexion, abduction and antepulsion showed a significant trend to improve of score.


INTRODUCTION
The objective of present research is to show our experience with the use of the palmaris major muscle.

METHODS
A longitudinal study was conducted in 39 patients diagnosed with radial nerve paralysis, where we assessed the functional results of tendinous transpositions to restore the finger extension.

RESULTS
The more frequent complication was the wrist radial deviation present in 4 patients in which we used the anterior cubital one.


Introduction
the rupture of rotator cuff (tendons of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles) is a disease affecting the shoulder with a high incidence.
It is more frequent present in persons practicing repetitive exercises and there is a background of trauma.
Arthroscopic diagnosis with its advantages is definite and exact and the appropriate interpretation of it guarantees the success of repair.

Methods
authors analyzed the results from 42 patients with total ruptures of rotator cuff, assessed using the Constant-Muley scale.

Results
in the patients included surgery was carried out in the dominant limb in the 66.6 %.
The first general assessment of results at 6 postoperative months showed an 83.3 % of excellent, goods and fair results.


Introduction
The information of lateral epicondylitis has been extrapolated to medial epicondylitis.

Results
we found an average area of 148.7 mm2 epicondyle.
The length, width and thickness of the conjoined tendon were 4.2 mm, 1.7 mm and 1 mm respectively.
It was found that the conjoint tendon is formed mostly by carpiradialis flexor tendon.

Conclusions
the Flexor carpiradialis formed largely tendinous component of the muscle-tendinous origin of the common Flexor and Pronator teres.
These muscles had a V configuration by medial and Y by lateral.
The ulnar nerve passed very close to the epicondyle and its alteration may be part of the symptoms of medial elbow pain.
We believe that being eminently tendinous the Flexor carpiradialis, could be the main seat of pathological changes in medial epicondylitis.


Introduction
Its signs and symptoms include pain and a feeling of instability.

Methods
Fifty-three citations were used, 46 of them from the last five years.

Results
a discussion is provided of topics of great epidemiological interest, such as the frequency with which the patellofemoral compartment is involved, and the differences between patellar chondromalacia and patellofemoral osteoarthritis.
A description is included of predisposing factors, among them patellofemoral dysplasia.
Imaging studies, especially those based on axial patellar views, are described in detail.
Reference is made to the importance of bone scintigraphy.
A description is presented of the most common treatment modes and their main indications.


INTRODUCTION
Overweight and obesity are global public health problems because of their effect on individuals, families and communities.
The objective of this study was to describe the profile of overweight and obesity amongst adult outpatients in Uyo in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.

RESULTS
Of the 584 subjects, 196 (36.6%) were men and 388 (66.4%) women.
The mean age for men and women was 43.3 ± 17.8 years and 50.2 ± 13.6 years, respectively.
The prevalence of overweight amongst men was 39.8% versus 31.7% for women; obesity in men was 28.0% versus 52.0% in women.
Overweight and obesity were more prevalent in subjects aged 25-54 years and amongst married subjects.
There was a significant relationship between obesity and television viewing (p = 0.003).
Hypertension (p = 0.008) and osteoarthropathies (p = 0.043) were more prevalent amongst the obese than the non-obese subjects.

CONCLUSION
Overweight and obesity are now common in our environment.


Abstract
BACKGROUD

METHODS
Quality improvement cycle.

RESULTS
Statistically-significant improvement in performance (p < 0.05) was shown in 10 criteria although the target standard was not always met.
In the re-audit, the target of achieving blood pressure control (< 140/90) in 70% of patients was achieved.

CONCLUSION
The quality of care for hypertension was suboptimal in our setting.
Simple interventions were designed and implemented to improve the quality of care.
These interventions led to significant improvement in structural and process criteria.
A corresponding significant improvement in the control of blood pressure was also seen.


Abstract
BACKGROUD

METHODS
A quantitative descriptive correlative research design was applied.
A sample consisting of 200 (8.5%) respondents was selected from a population of 2349.

CONCLUSION
The respondents on ART in this particular community health centre had poor knowledge of HIV and ART.
Increased attention needs to be given to patient education.


AIM
To investigate the relationship between hypertension and various indices of body adiposity in a transitioning, urban, black population.

RESULTS
Approximately 40% of the sample was HIV-positive and 63.4% hypertensive, with the greatest risk of hypertension being amongst older men.
Based on BMI, 23.0% were overweight and 32.1% obese.
Waist-to-height ratio showed that 58.6% had increased cardiovascular risk.
Mean BAI was 34.1%, whilst 76.3% had a body fat percentage in the overweight/obese category.
Waist circumference representing increased cardiovascular risk was found in 44.3% of women and 3.9% of men.
Significant positive correlations between mean arterial blood pressure and BMI (r = 0.261; p < 0.001), WHtR (r = 0.357; p < 0.001) and BAI (r = 0.245; p < 0.001) were found.
WHtR was a stronger predictor of mean arterial pressure than BMI or BAI.
HIV status showed an inverse correlation with all adiposity indices (p < 0.001).


BACKGROUND
Medicines play an important role in healthcare, but prices can be a barrier to patient care.

AIM
To determine the prices, availability and affordability of medicines along the supply chain in Swaziland.

METHODS
The standardised methodology designed by the World Health Organization and Health Action International was used to survey 16 chronic disease medicines.
Data were collected in one administrative area in 10 private retail pharmacies and 10 public health facilities.
Originator brand (OB) and lowest-priced generic equivalent (LPG) medicines were monitored and these prices were then compared with international reference prices (IRPs).
Affordability was calculated in terms of the daily wage of the lowest-paid unskilled government worker.

RESULTS
Mean availability was 68% in the public sector.
The total cumulative mark-ups for individual medicines range from 190.99% - 440.27%.
The largest contributor to add-on cost was the retail mark-up (31% - 53%).


OBJECTIVE
To assess the incidence of ectopic pregnancy (EP) in hospitals in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, West Africa.
Data on EP incidence in developing countries are rare and often out of date, particularly in Africa.


FINDINGS
Of 191 enrolled patients, 6 and 8 were excluded or lost to follow-up before day 14 and between day 14 and day 28, respectively.
For the AQ-treated patients, parasitological and clinical evaluation on day 14 showed late treatment failure in 2 of 61 (3.3%) and adequate clinical response with parasitological failure in one (1.6%).
There was an adequate clinical response in all patients treated with SP or SP+AQ.
Therapeutic failure rates on day 28 were 13.6%, 10.2% and 0% in the SP, AQ, and SP+AQ groups, respectively.
Anaemia improved in all three regimens.
AQ produced faster fever clearance but was associated with more transient minor side-effects than SP.
SP+AQ reduced the risk of recrudescence between day 14 and day 28 but increased the incidence of minor side-effects.


METHODS
The clinical and parasitological responses were monitored for 14 days.

CONCLUSION
Chloroquine should no longer be considered adequate for treating clinical falciparum malaria in vulnerable groups in the areas studied.


METHODS
Population-based studies using confirmation by blood culture of typhoid fever cases were sought by computer search of the multilingual scientific literature.
Where there were no eligible studies, data were extrapolated from neighbouring countries and regions.
Age-incidence curves were used to model rates measured among narrow age cohorts to the general population.
One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the sensitivity of the estimate to the assumptions.
The burden of paratyphoid fever was derived by a proportional method.

FINDINGS
A total of 22 eligible studies were identified.
Regions with high incidence of typhoid fever (>100/100 000 cases/year) include south-central Asia and south-east Asia.
Regions of medium incidence (10-100/100 000 cases/year) include the rest of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania, except for Australia and New Zealand.
Europe, North America, and the rest of the developed world have low incidence of typhoid fever (<10/100 000 cases/year).
We estimate that typhoid fever caused 21 650 974 illnesses and 216 510 deaths during 2000 and that paratyphoid fever caused 5 412 744 illnesses.


FINDINGS
The absolute number of Hib cases (reported to the national surveillance system) among children below one year of age decreased by 65%, from 55 cases in 1999-2000 to 19 cases in 2003-04.
Enhanced surveillance initiated in 2003, identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection and incomplete vaccination as contributing factors for Hib transmission.
The total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of H. influenzae remained unchanged because non-type b disease was being increasingly reported to the surveillance system concomitant with system enhancements.
Children with non-typable disease were more likely to be HIV-positive (32 of 34, 94%) than children with Hib disease (10 of 14, 71%), P = 0.051.
Recent Hib isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant (2% in 1999-2000 versus 19% in 2003-04, P = 0.001).


OBJECTIVE
In the Republic of Korea (ROK), soldiers stationed where there is a risk of contracting malaria have received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis since 1997.
However, chemoprophylaxis may facilitate the development of drug resistance, and late primary attacks in individuals who have received chemoprophylaxis are becoming more frequent.

FINDINGS
Of these cases, 634 (72.0%) had received chemoprophylaxis, and 324 (28.0%) had not.
Cases occurred mostly in summer, with a peak in July-August.
Stratification by chemoprophylaxis history revealed different times to onset.
Early primary attacks were more prevalent in the group not receiving chemoprophylaxis, while in the group receiving chemoprophylaxis most cases were late primary attacks.
Of the latter, 312 out of 461 (67.7%) did not take primaquine regularly.
After treatment of the first attack, 14 (1.2%) of 1158 were re-treated; all re-treated cases were cured using the same doses and regimen used for the first treatment.


CONCLUSION
Traditional control measures can be very effective at reducing transmission of SARS.


METHODS
A model was developed to follow the Kenyan 2004 birth cohort until death, with and without Hib vaccine.
Incidence of invasive Hib disease was estimated at Kilifi District Hospital and in the surrounding demographic surveillance system in coastal Kenya.
National Hib disease incidence was estimated by adjusting incidence observed by passive hospital surveillance using assumptions about access to care.
Case fatality rates were also assumed dependent on access to care.
A price of US$ 3.65 per dose of pentavalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hep B-Hib vaccine was used.
Multivariate Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios of uncertainty in parameter values.

FINDINGS
The introduction of Hib vaccine reduced the estimated incidence of Hib meningitis per 100 000 children aged < 5 years from 71 to 8; of Hib non-meningitic invasive disease from 61 to 7; and of non-bacteraemic Hib pneumonia from 296 to 34.
The costs per discounted disability adjusted life year (DALY) and per discounted death averted were US$ 38 (95% confidence interval, CI: 26-63) and US$ 1197 (95% CI: 814-2021) respectively.
Most of the uncertainty in the results was due to uncertain access to care parameters.
The break-even pentavalent vaccine price - where incremental Hib vaccination costs equal treatment costs averted from Hib disease - was US$ 1.82 per dose.


FINDINGS
Of the 13 978 children from 17 districts with suspected bacterial meningitis, 269 had confirmed Hib meningitis, declining from 69 patients in the prevaccine year (2001-2002) to three in 2006-2007.
Hib meningitis incidence dropped from 88 cases per 100 000 children aged < 5 years in the year before vaccine introduction to 13 within 4 years, and to near zero in the fifth year.
Vaccine effectiveness for 2 or more doses was 93% (95% confidence interval, CI: 69-99) against confirmed Hib meningitis and 53% (95% CI: 11-68) against purulent meningitis of unknown cause.
In Uganda, Hib vaccine prevents an estimated 28 000 cases of pneumonia and meningitis, 5000 deaths and 1000 severe meningitis sequelae each year.

CONCLUSION
Infant immunization with Hib vaccine has virtually eliminated Hib meningitis in Uganda within 5 years.


CONCLUSION
Children wear motorcycle helmets much less often than adults.
Legislation to penalize adults whose children do not wear motorcycle helmets has been proposed in Viet Nam.
Furthermore, ongoing advocacy and social marketing efforts are being made to disseminate information about the safety benefits of helmets to combat erroneous public perceptions.


METHODS
The trial included patients aged 5-65 years with scabies who attended the dermatology department at the Institut d'Hygiène Sociale in Dakar, Senegal.

FINDINGS
Bacterial superinfection occurred more often in the IV group than in the BB1 and BB2 groups combined (28% versus 7.8%, respectively; P = 0.006).
These clear findings prompted early study cessation.


FINDINGS
An estimated 158.1 million cases of visual impairment resulted from uncorrected or undercorrected refractive error in 2007; of these, 8.7 million were blind.
We estimated the global economic productivity loss in international dollars (I$) associated with this burden at I$ 427.7 billion before, and I$ 268.8 billion after, adjustment for country-specific labour force participation and employment rates.
With the same adjustment, but assuming no economic productivity for individuals aged > 50 years, we estimated the potential productivity loss at I$ 121.4 billion.


METHODS
Scores were then weighted according to the system of values expressed by a larger group of stakeholders.

FINDINGS
The questions that scored lowest related to the development of new interventions and new drugs or pharmacological agents, vaccines or other technologies.


FINDINGS
Exposure to PV during the 12 months preceding the survey was reported by 27-50% (average: 42%) of the children studied in the five countries, and lifetime exposure to SV was reported by 9-33% (average: 23%).
Moderate to strong associations were observed between exposure to PV or SV and measures of mental health, suicidal ideation, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, lifetime drug use, multiple sex partners and a history of sexually transmitted infection (P < 0.05 for all associations).


METHODS
We calculated the relative use of each anti-hypertensive drug group as a proportion of all anti-hypertensive drugs supplied or prescribed.

FINDINGS
Supply data showed that, in line with treatment guidelines, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently supplied medicines (42% and 27%, respectively).


FINDINGS
Solid fuel use contributes 30% (90% confidence interval: 18-44) to the burden of childhood pneumonia.

CONCLUSION
Environmental and nutritional interventions reduce pneumonia and provide other benefits.
These strategies combined may reduce total child mortality by 17%.


METHODS
We carried out a quasi-experimental study involving comparison groups, and a time-series analysis from 1 January 2002 to 30 April 2008.
The study group was composed of people injured while driving or riding a light motorcycle (engine capacity 51-125 cubic centimetres), while the comparison groups consisted of riders of heavy motorcycles (engine capacity > 125 cc), mopeds (engine capacity <50 cc) or cars who were injured in a collision within the city limits.
The "intervention" was a law passed in October 2004 allowing car drivers to drive light motorcycles without taking a special driving test.
To detect and quantify changes over time we used Poisson regression, with adjustments for trend and seasonality in road injuries and the existence of a driver's licence penalty point system.

FINDINGS
The risk of injury among light motorcycle riders was greater after the law than before (relative risk, RR = 1.46; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.34-1.60).


FINDINGS
The pooled incidence over the study period was 992 (95% CI: 567-1495) per 100 000.

CONCLUSION
Safe and effective tuberculosis prevention strategies are needed for HIV-infected infants.


FINDINGS
For 19 of 24 ARV dosage forms, we detected no association between price and volume purchased.
For the other five ARVs, high-volume purchases were 4-21% less expensive than medium- or low-volume purchases.
Nine of 13 generic ARVs were priced 6-36% lower when purchased under the Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI).
Fifteen of 18 branded ARVs were priced 23-498% higher for differentially priced purchases compared with non-CHAI generic purchases.
However, two branded, differentially priced ARVs were priced 63% and 73% lower, respectively, than generic non-CHAI equivalents.

CONCLUSION
Large purchase volumes did not necessarily result in lower ARV prices.
Although current plans for pooled procurement will further increase purchase volumes, savings are uncertain and should be balanced against programmatic costs.
Third-party negotiation by CHAI resulted in lower generic ARV prices.
Generics were less expensive than differentially priced branded ARVs, except where little generic competition exists.
Alternative strategies for reducing ARV prices, such as streamlining financial management systems, improving demand forecasting and removing barriers to generics, should be explored.


PROBLEM
Their impact on access to health services must be carefully examined.


CONCLUSION
Through a combination of shaming and subsidies, social marketing can improve sanitation worldwide.


CONCLUSION
A basic understanding of pandemic influenza is associated with stated willingness to comply with containment measures.
Investing now in promoting measures to prepare for a pandemic or other health emergency will have considerable value.


PROBLEM
However, the existing public health communication system in Sichuan province, China, was severely damaged by the earthquake.

APPROACH
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention set up a mobile phone emergency reporting system.
All phones were loaded with software designed for inputting and transmitting cases of infectious disease directly to a national database for further analysis.


METHODS
A pre-post, control group design was used.
Larval and adult vector populations were surveyed weekly in six separate valley communities.
The incidence of Plasmodium infections in children 6 months to 13 years of age was measured during the long and short rainy seasons each year.
Baseline data were collected for 17 months, after which Bacillus-based larvicides were applied weekly to aquatic habitats in three of the valleys for another 19 months.
At around the same time the larviciding was initiated, ITNs were introduced gradually into all study communities by the National Malaria Control Programme.
The effect of larviciding, ITNs and other determinants of malaria risk was assessed by means of generalized estimating equations.

CONCLUSION
Vector control with microbial larvicides enhanced the malaria control achieved with ITNs alone.


METHODS
Data were extracted, tabulated and analysed with Reviewer Manager (RevMan) 4.3 software.

FINDINGS
We included 46 trials with more than 40 000 participants in the final analysis.
Of 11 deaths reported in 5 trials, 8 occurred in women receiving > 600 µg of misoprostol (Peto odds ratio, OR: 2.49; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76-8.13).
Severe morbidity, defined as the need for major surgery, admission to intensive care, organ failure or body temperature > 40 ºC, was relatively infrequent.
In prevention trials, severe morbidity was experienced by 16 of 10 281 women on misoprostol and by 16 of 10 292 women on conventional uterotonics; in treatment trials, it was experienced by 1 of 32 women on misoprostol and by 1 of 32 women on conventional uterotonics.
Misoprostol recipients experienced more adverse events than placebo recipients: 8 of 2070 versus 5 of 2032, respectively, in prevention trials, and 5 of 196 versus 2 of 202, respectively, in treatment trials.
Meta-analysis of direct and adjusted indirect comparisons of the results of randomized trials showed no evidence that 600 µg are more effective than 400 µg for preventing blood loss > 1000 ml (relative risk, RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.71-1.48).
Pyrexia was more than twice as common among women who received > 600 µg rather than 400 µg of misoprostol (RR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78-3.60).


METHODS
We then compared studies designed before and after the recommendations were issued in terms of seven key methodological indicators.

FINDINGS
We found 102 studies conducted in 39 countries; 60 were designed before and 42 after the guidelines were issued.
The methods used in these 102 studies varied considerably.
While some encouraging trends were noted, there is no evidence that the design recommendations have been systematically implemented.


FINDINGS
The TB incidence rate changed annually within a range of ±10% over the study period in the 134 countries examined, and its average value declined in 93 countries.
The rate was declining more quickly in countries that had a higher human development index, lower child mortality and access to improved sanitation.
General development measures were also dominant explanatory variables within regions, though correlation with TB incidence trends varied geographically.
The TB incidence rate was falling more quickly in countries with greater health expenditure (situated in central and eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean), high-income countries with lower immigration, and countries with lower child mortality and HIV infection rates (located in Latin America and the Caribbean).
The intensity of TB control varied widely, and a possible causal link with TB incidence was found only in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the rate of detection of smear-positive cases showed a negative correlation with national incidence trends.


APPROACH
A culturally appropriate delivery care model was developed in poor and isolated rural communities, and implemented between 1999 and 2001 in cooperation with the Quechua indigenous communities and health professionals.
Data on birth location and attendance in one health centre have been collected up to 2007.


METHODS
The Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was administered to screen for mental disorder.


METHODS
Verbal autopsies were conducted for all 7930 deaths observed between January 2000 and December 2006 in a demographic surveillance population of 74 500 in the Umkhanyakude district of northern KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.


FINDINGS
Between 20% and 30% included sexual health counselling, gender-based violence, and the linking of voluntary counselling and testing for HIV with sexual and reproductive health services.
Less than 20% focused on adolescent sexual and reproductive health, the rights and needs of people living with HIV, or safe abortion services.
All these elements were rarely featured, if at all, in the grant agreements reviewed.
Overall, however, sexual and reproductive health indicators did appear in most HIV-related proposals and in more than 80% of the grant agreements.


METHODS
The magnitude and consistency of aRRs allowed for an estimate of incremental effects.

FINDINGS
A total of 1409 participants were enrolled, all female, with a median age of 45.


APPROACH
Clients attended eight public VCT facilities in the Oromia region, Ethiopia.


PROBLEM
Successful attempts to control malaria require understanding of its complex transmission patterns.


METHODS
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the http://clinicaltrials.gov web site.
We also checked the reference lists of existing systematic reviews and of all trials identified by the above methods.
We searched exclusively for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing artemether/arteether with quinine for treating cerebral malaria in children.
Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility and trial quality and extracted the data.

FINDINGS
Nine RCTs were included in the analysis, and all were from Africa.
Five had adequate allocation concealment.
Seven trials compared artemether with quinine (1220 children), and two compared arteether with quinine (194 children).
No statistically significant difference was found between artemisinin derivatives and quinine in preventing mortality (relative risk, RR: 0.91; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.73-1.14; I²: 0%).
The quality of the evidence, as assessed by the Grade evidence profile, was moderate.
The only serious adverse event was seen in a patient in the quinine group who developed fatal black water fever.


OBJECTIVE
To examine trends and variations in maternal mortality in China between 2000 and 2005.

FINDINGS
The MMR declined by an average of 5% per year (crude relative risk, RR: 0.95; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.94-0.97).
There was no interaction between region and year (P = 0.2311).
Mortality declined by 5% per year in the eastern region (crude RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97), by 5% per year in the central region (crude RR; 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96), and by 4% per year in the western region (crude RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94-0.98).
The absolute difference in MMR between the western and eastern regions declined from 65.4 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2000 to 49.4 per 100 000 live births in 2005.


OBJECTIVE
To examine how health aid is spent and channelled, including the distribution of resources across countries and between subsectors.

FINDINGS
Countries with comparable levels of poverty and health need receive remarkably different levels of aid.
Funding for Millennium Development Goal 6 (combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) accounts for much of the recent increase in health ODA, while many other health priorities remain insufficiently funded.
Aid is highly fragmented at country level, which entails high transaction costs, divergence from national policies and lack of coherence between development partners.


PROBLEM
An unsafe environment is a risk factor for child injury and violence.


PROBLEM
Poliovirus transmission remained a public health challenge in western Uttar Pradesh, India in late 2005 and early 2006.


PROBLEM
India has the world's largest number of maternal deaths estimated at 117 000 per year.


METHODS
We performed a secondary analysis of randomly selected participants in a community-based TB-HIV prevalence survey in Harare, Zimbabwe.
All completed a five-symptom questionnaire and underwent sputum TB culture and HIV testing.
We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of various symptoms and used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between symptoms and TB disease.

FINDINGS
We found one or more symptoms of TB in 21.2% of 1858 HIV-positive (HIV+) and 9.9% of 7121 HIV-negative (HIV−) participants (P < 0.001).
TB was subsequently diagnosed in 48 HIV+ and 31 HIV− participants.
TB was asymptomatic in 18 culture-positive individuals, 8 of whom (4 in each HIV status group) had positive sputum smears.
Cough of any duration, weight loss and, for HIV+ participants only, drenching night sweats were independent predictors of TB.
Symptoms had a similar sensitivity and specificity in HIV+ and HIV− participants, but in HIV+ participants they had a higher positive and a lower negative predictive value.


FINDINGS
Females reported more neglect and emotional abuse, whereas males reported more physical abuse, but no statistically significant difference was found between genders in the prevalence of sexual abuse.
The proportions of the variance explained by the models ranged from 21% to 28%.

CONCLUSION
Emotional abuse was strongly associated with each health indicator.


METHODS
We obtained data on annual CE incidence from surveillance and abattoir records, and on CE-related treatment and productivity losses (human and animal) from the scientific literature.
Indirect costs comprised human productivity losses and the reduction in growth, fecundity and milk production in livestock.
The Latin hypercube method was used to represent the uncertainty surrounding the input parameters.

CONCLUSION
CE is a neglected zoonosis that remains a human and animal health concern for Spain.
More accurate data on CE prevalence in humans (particularly undiagnosed or asymptomatic cases) and better methods to estimate productivity losses in animals are needed.
CE continues to affect certain areas of Spain, despite several control initiatives since 1986.


METHODS
The study involved children aged less than 18 months recruited from Haryana, India, in 2005-2006: 4336 in a pre-intervention cohort and 5213 in a post-intervention cohort.
In addition, immunization of 814 hospitalized children from outside the study area was also assessed.
Operational barriers to age-appropriate immunization with diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) vaccine were investigated by monitoring vaccination coverage, observing immunization sessions and interviewing parents and health-care providers.
An intervention package was developed, with community volunteers playing a pivotal role.
Its effectiveness was assessed by monitoring the ages at which the three DPT doses were administered.

FINDINGS
The main reasons for delayed immunization were staff shortages, non-adherence to plans and vaccine being out of stock.
In the post-intervention cohort, 70% received a third DPT dose before the age of 6 months, significantly more than in the pre-intervention cohort (62%; P = 0.002).
In addition, the mean age at which the first, second and third DPT doses were administered decreased by 17, 21 and 34 days, respectively, in the study area over a period of 18 months (P for trend < 0.0001).
No change was observed in hospitalized children from outside the study area.


METHODS
Patient costs were collected from patient records.

CONCLUSION
The choice of emollient should be made taking into account budgetary limitations and ease of supply.
Further research is warranted on additional locally available emollients, use of emollients in community-based settings and generalizability to other geographic regions.


METHODS
We followed a stratified multistage cluster random design.
We assessed the intra-hospital occurrence of severe maternal morbidity and the latter's association with maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes.

FINDINGS
Being older than 35 years, not having a partner, being a primipara or para > 3, and having had a Caesarean section in the previous pregnancy were factors independently associated with the occurrence of severe maternal morbidity.


FINDINGS
If age-adjusted CHD mortality rates observed in 2000 remained unchanged, some 388 000 CHD deaths would occur in 2010.
First scenario: if recent risk factor trends continued to 2010, there would be approximately 19 000 fewer deaths than in 2000.
Second scenario: If Healthy People 2010 cardiovascular risk factor targets were reached, approximately 188 000 CHD deaths would be prevented.
Scenario three: If the cardiovascular risk levels of the low-risk stratum were reached, approximately 372 000 CHD deaths would be prevented.

CONCLUSION
Additional reductions in major risk factors could prevent or postpone substantially more deaths from CHD.


FINDINGS
Of India's 35 states or union territories, 21 reported cholera cases during at least one year between 1997 and 2006.
There were 68 outbreaks in 18 states, and 222 038 cases were detected overall.
This figure is about six times higher than the number reported to WHO (37 783) over the same period.
The states of Orissa, West Bengal, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Assam and Chhattisgarh accounted for 91% of all outbreak-related cases.


METHODS
We performed a descriptive analysis of maternal mortality data collected through Mongolia's vital registration system and provided by the Mongolian Ministry of Health.
The observed declining mortality trend was analysed for statistical significance using simple linear regression.
We present the maternal mortality ratios from 1992 to 2007 by year and review the basic components of Mongolia's Maternal Mortality Reduction Strategy for 2001-2004 and 2005-2010.

CONCLUSION
Disparities in maternal mortality represent one of the major persisting health inequities between low- and high-resource countries.


PROBLEM
According to the International Health Regulations (IHR), countries need to strengthen core capacity for disease surveillance and response systems.
Many countries are establishing or enhancing their field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) to meet human resource needs but face challenges in sustainability and training quality.


PROBLEM
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes have been successful in several countries.
The outcomes and specific problems encountered in such a setting have not been adequately studied.

APPROACH
We assessed the efficacy and functioning of India's national ART programme in a tertiary care centre in northern India.
Periodic clinical and laboratory evaluations were carried out in accordance with national guidelines.
Changes in CD4+ lymphocyte count, body weight and body mass index were assessed at follow-up, and the operational problems analysed.


PROBLEM
Afghan women have one of the world's highest lifetime risks of maternal death.
Years of conflict have devastated the country's health infrastructure.


FINDINGS
The 41 (59%) respondent countries, representing all WHO regions, comprised 85% of the global burden of HIV-associated TB and 82% of the global burden of HIV infection.
Thirty-eight countries (93%) had an established national policy for CTXp, but only 66% of them (25/38) had achieved nationwide implementation.
For IPT, 21 of 41 countries (51%) had a national policy but only 28% of them (6/21) had achieved nationwide implementation.
Despite significant progress in the development of CTXp policy, the limited availability of co-trimoxazole for this indication and inadequate systems to manage drug supply impeded nationwide implementation.
Inadequate intensified tuberculosis case-finding and concerns regarding isoniazid resistance were challenges to the development and implementation of national IPT policies.

CONCLUSION
Urgent steps are required to facilitate the development and implementation of these policies.


METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature published from 1 January 1987 to 1 September 2007 in all languages using PubMed and EMBASE.
The purpose was to identify population-based studies of epilepsy prevalence that reported the epilepsy treatment gap, defined as the proportion of people with epilepsy who require but do not receive treatment.
Negative binomial regression models were used to assess trends and associations.

FINDINGS
The treatment gap was over 75% in low-income countries and over 50% in most lower middle- and upper middle-income countries, while many high-income countries had gaps of less than 10%.
However, treatment gaps varied widely both between and within countries.
They were significantly higher in rural areas (rate ratio, RR: 2.01; 95% confidence interval, Cl: 1.40-2.89) and countries with lower World Bank income classification (RR: 1.55; 95% Cl: 1.32-1.82).
There was no significant trend in treatment gap over time (RR: 0.92; 95% Cl: 0.79-1.07).


METHODS
We calculated age-adjusted rates, by sex, population group and city, for death from the five leading causes of fatal injury as well as population attributable risks (PARs).

FINDINGS
The leading causes of fatal injury in childhood included road traffic injuries - among vehicle passengers and especially among pedestrians - drowning, burns and, in some cities, firearm injuries.
Large differences in PARs were observed, particularly for population groups and cities.


FINDINGS
Of 114 389 adult inhabitants, 94 179 (82.3%) were screened.
Of 87 314 (92.7%) screened by both questionnaire and chest X-ray, 3522 (4.0%) had productive cough, 518 (0.6%) had a recent history of tuberculosis and 2972 (3.4%) had chest X-ray abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis.
Sputum tests were done for 7648 participants.
Sputum test, bacterial culture or both confirmed 269 tuberculosis cases, 174 of which were smear-positive.
The prevalence rate of smear-positive tuberculosis was 145 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval: 110-180) assuming no tuberculosis in persons aged < 15 years.
Prevalence was 5.1 times as high in men as in women, increased with age, was higher in rural than in urban or remote areas and showed a north-to-south gradient.

CONCLUSION
Age and sex patterns were consistent with notification data.
Tuberculosis control should remain a high priority in Viet Nam.


METHODS
A multistate model depicted six cohorts of 100 000 15-year-old girls who survived until the age of 45 years.
Cohort members were modelled to have various degrees of FGM, to undergo childbirth according to each country's mortality and fertility statistics, and to have medically attended deliveries at the frequency observed in the relevant country.
The risk of obstetric complications was estimated based on a 2006 study of 28 393 women.
The costs of each complication were estimated in purchasing power parity dollars (I$) for 2008 and discounted at 3%.
The model also tracked life years lost owing to fatal obstetric haemorrhage.
Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the uncertainty around the findings.


FINDINGS
The study recorded 59 165 pregnancies, 173 maternal deaths, 1661 stillbirths and 1418 early neonatal deaths in its service area over the study period.
During that time, the use of skilled attendance during childbirth increased from 5.2% to 52.6%.
More than half (57.8%) of the women who died and one-third (33.7%) of those who experienced a perinatal death (i.e. a stillbirth or early neonatal death) had sought skilled attendance.
Maternal mortality was low among women who did not seek skilled care (160 per 100 000 pregnancies) and was nearly 32 times higher (adjusted odds ratio, OR: 31.66; 95% confidence interval, CI: 22.03-45.48) among women who came into contact with comprehensive emergency obstetric care.
Over time, the strength of the association between skilled obstetric care and maternal mortality declined as more women sought such care.
Perinatal death rates were also higher for those who sought skilled care than for those who did not, although the strength of association was much weaker.

CONCLUSION
Reductions in perinatal mortality will require strategies such as early detection and management of health problems during pregnancy.


METHODS
We constructed a measure of the urban environment for seven areas using a seven-item scale based on data from the Census of India 2001 to develop an "urbanicity" scale.
The scale was used in conjunction with data collected from 3705 participants in the World Health Organization's 2003 STEPwise risk factor surveillance survey in Tamil Nadu, India, to analyse the relationship between the urban environment and major NCD risk factors.
Linear and logistic regression models were constructed examining the relationship between urbanicity and chronic disease risk.

FINDINGS
In both sexes urbanicity was positively associated with the mean number of servings of fruit and vegetables consumed per day (P< 0.05).


METHODS
We investigated 1445 children aged < 2 years during a vaccine trial (2001-2006) in a rural South African community.
Clinical, radiological and microbiological data were collected prospectively.
Tuberculosis case status was determined using each of the nine diagnostic approaches.
We calculated differences in case frequency and categorical agreement for binary (tuberculosis/not tuberculosis) outcomes using McNemar's test (with 95% confidence intervals, CIs) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K).


FINDINGS
Complete data for DCE analysis were available for 302 of 310 (97%) students.
All attribute parameter estimates differed significantly from zero and had the expected signs.
Discontinuing the provision of basic housing had a large negative influence (β = -1.59; 95% CI: -1.88 to -1.31).
In models including gender interaction terms, women's preferences were more influenced by supportive management and men's preferences by superior housing.


METHODS
A cohort survey of 412 nursing and medical students in Rwanda provided unique contingent valuation data.

FINDINGS
The main result for intrinsic motivation in Rwanda was strikingly similar to the result obtained for Ethiopia and Rwanda combined.


FINDINGS
Nurses' preferences for different human resource policy interventions varied significantly between the three countries.


APPROACH
In recent years, the Ministry of Health adopted measures to improve the posting, recruitment and retention of health workers in rural and remote areas.


APPROACH
Several corrective measures have been tried over the years.
A 1998 survey among primary care physicians signalled the need for new interventions conducive to professional development in rural areas.


METHODS
Two geographically distant regions in two countries (China and Nigeria) were selected and 10 pairs of primary care facilities in each region were randomly selected and matched.
Each facility enrolled 60 consecutive patients with hypertension.

FINDINGS
The study included 2397 patients with baseline hypertension: 1191 in 20 intervention facilities and 1206 in 20 control facilities.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more in intervention patients than in controls.
However, at 12 months more than half of patients still had uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg).
Behavioural risk factors had improved among intervention patients in Nigeria but not in China.
Only about 2% of hypertensive patients required referral to the next level of care.


METHODS
In July 2008, we sent a questionnaire to all 131 facilities providing HIV care in Zimbabwe.

FINDINGS
Nationally, 115 (88%) facilities responded.
In 98 (75%) that provided complete data, 196 032 patients were registered and 24 958 (13%) of them were children.
Of children under HIV care, 33% were aged 0-4 years; 25%, 5-9 years; 25%, 10-14 years; and 17%, 15-19 years.
Staff highlighted differences in the problems most commonly faced by younger children and adolescents.
For younger children, such problems were malnutrition and lack of appropriate drugs (cited by 46% and 40% of clinics, respectively); for adolescents they concerned psychosocial issues and poor drug adherence (cited by 56% and 36%, respectively).


FINDINGS
(ii) What is the impact of dual practice and multiple employment? and (iii) How can incentives be used to optimize efficiency and the quality of health care?


APPROACH
The results were reported directly to policy-makers at the Ministry of Health.


METHODS
Computerized monitoring was used to determine: (i) the number of confirmed HIV infections, (ii) losses to the programme (i.e. death or loss to follow-up) before ART, (iii) mortality and loss-to-programme rates during 12 months of ART, and (iv) determinants of mortality and losses to the programme.

FINDINGS
Loss-to-programme rates were roughly double mortality rates and followed the same trend with duration of ART.
Independent predictors of 12-month mortality on ART were pre-ART weight-for-age z-score < -2, percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes < 10, World Health Organization HIV/AIDS clinical stage 3 or 4, and blood haemoglobin < 8 g/dl.


METHODS
Only the most recently born infant of each mother was included.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors linked to early neonatal death.

FINDINGS
Of the 40 576 infants included, 442 experienced early neonatal death.
After adjustment, the risk of early neonatal death was significantly reduced for infants of mothers who received either any form of antenatal care (hazard ratio, HR: 0.48; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.31-0.73), any quantity of iron and folic acid (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.36-0.77) or > 2 tetanus toxoid injections (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48-0.92).
Subsequent analysis showed that 20% of early neonatal deaths in Indonesia could be attributed to a lack of iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.


APPROACH
We programmed, designed and supervised the use of PDAs for a large survey enumeration and mass vaccination campaign.


FINDINGS
If adjustment for underreporting is made (i.e. by assuming 50% of the unreported girls are dead), mortality estimates go up to 140 and 209, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The sociocultural aspects of mortality and their effect on the reporting of births and deaths in Afghanistan need to be investigated further.


METHODS
A new outcome score based on a 15-item questionnaire was developed after a literature review, examination of current assessment tools, discussion with experts and a pilot study.
The score was used to evaluate 100 children in Malaysia (56 Japanese encephalitis patients, 2 patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and 42 controls) and 95 in India (36 Japanese encephalitis patients, 41 patients with encephalitis of unknown etiology and 18 controls).
Inter- and intra-observer variability in the outcome score was determined and the score was compared with full clinical assessment.

FINDINGS
There was good inter-observer agreement on using the new score to identify likely dependency (K = 0.942 for Malaysian children; K = 0.786 for Indian children) and good intra-observer agreement (K = 1.000 and 0.902, respectively).
In addition, agreement between the new score and clinical assessment was also good (K = 0.906 and 0.762, respectively).
Positive and negative predictive values were 84.2% and 100% in Malaysia and 65.6% and 100% in India.


METHODS
A total of 475 vials of 8 different types of World Health Organization prequalified freeze-sensitive vaccines from 10 different manufacturers were used.
Vaccines were kept at 5 °C.
Selected numbers of vials from each type were then exposed to "25 °C and "2 °C for 24-hour periods.

FINDINGS
By contrast, aggregates in the freeze-damaged samples measured up to 700 μm (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and 350 μm on average.


METHODS
We performed meta-analysis to calculate the pooled risk of outcomes.

FINDINGS
Five trials, all from southAsia, satisfied the inclusion criteria.
The intervention packages included in them comprised antenatal home visits (all trials), home visits during the neonatal period (all trials), home-based treatment for illness (3 trials) and community mobilization efforts (4 trials).
Meta-analysis showed a reduced risk of neonatal death (relative risk, RR: 0.62; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.440.87) and stillbirth (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.65-0.89), and a significant improvement in antenatal and neonatal practice indicators (1 antenatal check-up, 2 doses of maternal tetanus toxoid, clean umbilical cord care, early breastfeeding and delayed bathing).
Only one trial recorded infant deaths (RR: 0.41; 0.30-0.57).
Subgroup analyses suggested a greater survival benefit when home visit coverage was > 50% (P < 0.001) and when both preventive and curative interventions (injectable antibiotics) were conducted (P= 0.088).


METHODS
Background information and full birth histories were collected by conducting household surveys and interviewing women.
Control villages resembling project villages in terms of population size were randomly selected from an area enclosed by two ellipses centred around, but not including, the project area.
An equal number of villages and approximately equal numbers of households and women were randomly sampled from both areas.
Cox models with robust standard errors were used to compare the hazard of death among children under 5 years of age in project and control villages.


METHODS
Rates and causes of child mortality were obtained from a continuous-registration demographic surveillance system (DSS) in Malawi for a population of 32 000.
After initial census, births and deaths were reported by village informants and updated monthly by project enumerators.
Cause of death was established by verbal autopsy whenever possible.
The likely impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on child mortality was also estimated from antenatal clinic surveillance data.
Overall and age-specific mortality rates were compared with those from the 2004 Malawi DHS.

FINDINGS
Between August 2002 and February 2006, 38 617 person-years of observation were recorded for 20 388 children aged < 15 years.
There were 342 deaths.
Infant mortality was 52.7 per 1000 live births, under-5 mortality was 84.8 per 1000 and under-15 mortality was 99.1 per 1000.
One-fifth of deaths by age 15 were attributable to HIV infection.
Child mortality rates estimated with the DSS were approximately 30% lower than those from national estimates as determined by routine surveys.


METHODS
In this retrospective subgroup analysis of infants aged < 6 months, six clusters were randomly assigned to intervention or control sites.
Care providers were trained to give zinc and ORS to children with acute diarrhoea at intervention sites, and only ORS at control sites.
Surveys were conducted at 3 and 6 months to assess outcomes.
Differences between intervention and control sites in episodes of diarrhoea and ALRI in the preceding 24 hours or 14 days and of hospitalizations in the preceding 3 months were analysed by logistic regression.

CONCLUSION
More studies are needed to confirm these findings as these data are from a subgroup analysis.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Despite past barriers to enforcement, increased policing in 2008 led to 680 000 infringements being issued for non-helmet wearing.
While changes in helmet wearing were not nationally observed, significant increases were documented in selected provinces in the first six months of the law's introduction.
In Da Nang, helmet wearing increased from 27 to 99%.


LOCAL SETTING
Mumbwa is a rural district with an area of 23 000 km2 and a population of 167 000.
Before the introduction of mobile services, ART services were provided only at Mumbwa District Hospital.


METHODS
An algorithm for predicting the effect of IPTi was developed using two approaches.
The decision-support tool uses the data from these two approaches that are most relevant to the context specified by the user.

CONCLUSION
The effectiveness of IPTi varies with malaria transmission intensity and seasonality.
Deciding where to implement IPTi must take into account the local epidemiology of malaria.


METHODS
The completeness and coverage of recent national death registration data from the World Health Organization mortality database were assessed.

FINDINGS
Recent death registration data were available for 83 countries, comprising 28% of the global population.
They included most high-income countries, most countries in Latin America and several in central Asia and the Caribbean.
Categories commonly used for partially specified external causes of injury resulting in death included "undetermined intent," "unspecified mechanism of unintentional injury," "unspecified road injury" and "unspecified mechanism of homicide".
Only 20 countries had high-quality data.


METHODS
The questionnaire inquired about the availability of the hospital facilities, equipment, drugs and disposable materials required to implement the SSC guidelines.
Descriptive methods were used for statistical analysis.
Comparisons between central and peripheral hospitals were performed using non-parametric tests.

FINDINGS
The response rate was 86.4% (38/44).
No Mongolian hospital had the resources required to consistently implement the SSC guidelines.
The median percentage of implementable recommendations and suggestions combined was 52.8% (interquartile range, IQR: 45.8-67.4%); of implementable recommendations only, 68% (IQR: 58.0-80.5%) and of implementable suggestions only, 43.5% (IQR: 34.8-57.6%).
These percentages did not differ between hospitals located in the capital city and those located in rural areas.


METHODS
The panel study involved a random sample of 895 households from over 50 000 enrolled in a cash-for-work programme between September and December 2007 and 921 similar control households.
The height, weight and mid-upper arm circumference of one woman and child aged less than 5 years from each household were measured at baseline and at the end of the study (mean time: 10 weeks).
Women reported 7-day household food expenditure and consumption on both occasions.
Changes in parameters were compared between the two groups.

FINDINGS
At baseline, no significant difference existed between the groups.


FINDINGS
We included in the analysis 17 articles that met our basic quality criteria: 5 randomized human laboratory trials and 12 epidemiological studies.
The majority of the papers (14) examined self-reported non-specific symptoms of ill-health.
Most of the randomized trials did not detect any association between MPBS radiation and the development of acute symptoms during or shortly after exposure.
The sporadically observed associations did not show a consistent pattern with regard to symptoms or types of exposure.
We also found that the more sophisticated the exposure assessment, the less likely it was that an effect would be reported.
Studies on health effects other than non-specific symptoms and studies on MPBS exposure in children were scarce.

CONCLUSION
At present, there is insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about health effects from long-term low-level exposure typically occurring in the everyday environment.


FINDINGS
Six studies reported the prevalence of traditional male circumcision, which had been practised in 25-90% of all circumcised male study participants.
Most circumcisions were performed in boys 13-20 years of age.
Only two of the six studies on complications reported overall complication rates (35% and 48%) following traditional male circumcision.
The most common complications were infection, incomplete circumcision requiring re-circumcision and delayed wound healing.
Infection was the most frequent cause of hospitalization.
Mortality related to traditional male circumcision was 0.2%.


METHODS
We searched three Chinese databases (the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, 1980-2009; the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database, 1980-2009; and the Weipu Journal Database, 1989-2009) to identify Chinese-language articles about the safety of traditional needle acupuncture.
Case reports, case series, surveys and other observational studies were included if they reported factual data, but review articles, translations and clinical trials were excluded.

FINDINGS
The inclusion criteria were met by 115 articles (98 case reports and 17 case series) that in total reported on 479 cases of adverse events after acupuncture.
Fourteen patients died.
Acupuncture-related adverse events were classified into three categories: traumatic, infectious and "other".
The most frequent adverse events were pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid haemorrhage and infection, while the most serious ones were cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid haemorrhage, pneumothorax and recurrent cerebral haemorrhage.


CONCLUSION
Drug donations can do more harm than good for the recipient countries.


FINDINGS
MMRs varied significantly by district in Bangladesh, from 158 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births at Dhaka district to 782 in the northern coastal regions.


METHODS
In a hospital in Chandigarh, we prospectively studied all stillbirths occurring from 15 April 2006 to 31 March 2008 whose cause was diagnosed within 2 days.
Causes of stillbirths as determined by hospital assessment and verbal autopsy were compared in frequency.


METHODS
In China, police-recorded data are obtained from police records by means of a standardized, closed-ended data collection form; these data are published in the China statistical yearbook of communication and transportation.


LESSONS LEARNT
The problem of uneven distribution of skilled health workers can be solved.
Educational strategies and community health worker programmes have shown promising results.


FINDINGS
In the models examined, the estimated number of child deaths from rotavirus infection varied between 492 000 and 664 000.

CONCLUSION
Sampling variability explains only a portion of the overall uncertainty in a modelled estimate.


METHODS
Serum levels of thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as urinary secretion of thiocyanate, which can affect the transport of iodine into thyrocytes, were also measured.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of goitre in the different samples ranged from 12.2% to 77.7% and was 38.8% overall.
The highest mean serum Tg level (66.98 ng/ml) was found in Kosti city, which also had the highest prevalence of goitre.


FINDINGS
BMI was low (< 18.5), normal (18.5-22.9) and high (> 23.0) in 26.1%, 65.4% and 8.5% of the women, respectively.


FINDINGS
During 1998-2007, the proportion of facility-based deliveries increased from 55% to 90%.
In 2007, 60% of births occurred at county-level or higher-level facilities.
The Caesarean delivery rate increased from 6% to 26%.
Total expenditure on a facility-based delivery increased by 152%, with a marked rise from 2002 onwards with the introduction of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme.
In 2007, out-of-pocket expenditure on a facility-based delivery equalled 13% of the mean annual household income for low-income households.
This proportion had decreased from 18% in 2002 and differences between income groups had narrowed.
Regression models showed that Caesarean delivery and delivery at a higher-level facility were associated with higher expenditure in 2007.
The New Cooperative Medical Scheme was associated with lower out-of-pocket expenditure on Caesarean delivery but not on vaginal delivery.

CONCLUSION
The financial burden on the rural poor remained high.


FINDINGS
Participants totalled 1244.


METHODS
An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using data from 656 children with Plasmodium falciparum and/or P. vivax malaria who participated in a large intervention trial in two clinics in northern Papua New Guinea.
The children were randomized to one of the following groups: (i) conventional treatment with chloroquine plus sulfadoxine plus pyrimethamine (CQ+S+P); (ii) artesunate plus S plus P; (iii) dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DHA+PQ); and (iv) artemether plus lumefantrine (A+L).
For treatment outcomes, World Health Organization definitions were used.
The cost of transport between home and the clinic plus direct health-care costs served as a basis for determining each regimen's incremental cost per incremental treatment success relative to CQ+S+P by day 42 and its cost per life year saved.


METHODS
The analysis was conducted with Demographic and Health Survey data from 13 sub-Saharan African countries.
Wealth-related inequities in the use of contraception were calculated using household wealth and concentration indices.

FINDINGS
The use of contraception has increased substantially between surveys in Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia but has declined slightly in Kenya, Senegal and Uganda.
After adjustment for fertility intention, women in the richest wealth quintile were more likely than those in the poorest quintile to practice long-term contraception.


METHODS
Deaths in the World Health Organization's mortality database were distributed among 48 mutually exclusive causes.
For each cause, age- and sex-specific global death rates were compared with the average rate among people aged 65-69, 70-74 and 75-79 years to generate "relative" global death rates.
Relative rates were also computed for South Africa alone.
Differences between global and South African relative death rates were used to identify the causes to which deaths from HIV/AIDS were misattributed in South Africa and quantify the HIV/AIDS deaths misattributed to each.
These deaths were then reattributed to HIV/AIDS.

FINDINGS
In South Africa, deaths from HIV/AIDS are often misclassified as being caused by 14 other conditions.
More than 90% of HIV/AIDS deaths were found to have been misattributed to other causes during 1996-2006.


METHODS
In 2009, 193 National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) were invited to use the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR to determine whether 10 fictitious public health events should be notified to WHO.
Each event's notifiability was assessed independently by an expert panel.
The degree of consensus among NFPs and of concordance between NFPs and the expert panel was considered high when more than 70% agreed on a response.

FINDINGS
Overall, 74% of NFPs responded.
The median degree of consensus among NFPs on notification decisions was 78%.
It was high for the six events considered notifiable by the majority (median: 80%; range: 76-91) but low for the remaining four (median: 55%; range: 54-60).
The NFPs identified notifiable events with greater sensitivity than specificity (P < 0.001).


FINDINGS
Large heterogeneity between data sources was noted.
Motor vehicle collisions caused by drivers increased twofold between 2003 and 2007.
Reported motor vehicle collisions, deaths and injuries increased by 34%, 33% and 47%, respectively, over that period.

CONCLUSION
In Kyrgyzstan, the number of motor vehicle collisions is rising and so is the number of those who are injured or killed in them.


METHODS
A systematic search for randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies comparing home-based and clinic-based medical abortion was conducted.
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Popline were searched.
Failure to abort completely, side-effects and acceptability were the main outcomes of interest.
Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.
Estimates were pooled using a random-effects model.

FINDINGS
Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 4522 participants).
All were prospective cohort studies that used mifepristone and misoprostol to induce abortion.
Complete abortion was achieved by 86-97% of the women who underwent home-based abortion (n = 3478) and by 80-99% of those who underwent clinic-based abortion (n = 1044).
Pooled analyses from all studies revealed no difference in complete abortion rates between groups (odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5-1.5).
Serious complications from abortion were rare.
Pain and vomiting lasted 0.3 days longer among women who took misoprostol at home rather than in clinic.
Women who chose home-based medical abortion were more likely to be satisfied, to choose the method again and to recommend it to a friend than women who opted for medical abortion in a clinic.


LESSONS LEARNT
The voluntary sector can interface effectively between the government and the community to strengthen vital registration.
The potential relevance of the data and the data collection process to stakeholders at the local level is a critical factor for success.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Therefore, it was not possible to establish a demographic and health cohort.

LESSONS LEARNT
Prospective demographic and health cohorts are the most accurate method to assess child mortality and other demographic indices.
However, their feasibility in a highly mobile pastoral setting remains to be shown.


FINDINGS
Multiple micronutrient supplementation was more effective than iron and folic acid supplementation at reducing the risk of low birth weight (RR:0.86, 95% confidence interval, CI:0.79-0.93) and of small size for gestational age (RR:0.85; 95% CI: 0.78-0.93).
Micronutrient supplementation had no overall effect on perinatal mortality (RR:1.05; 95% CI:0.90-1.22), although substantial heterogeneity was evident (I2=58%; P for heterogeneity=0.008).

CONCLUSION
The safety, efficacy and effective delivery of maternal micronutrient supplementation require further research.


FINDINGS
The availability of medicines for both acute and chronic conditions was suboptimal across countries, particularly in the public sector.
Generic medicines for chronic conditions were significantly less available than generic medicines for acute conditions in both the public sector (36.0% availability versus 53.5%; P=0.001) and the private sector (54.7% versus 66.2%; P=0.007).
Antiasthmatics, antiepileptics and antidepressants, followed by antihypertensives, were the drivers of the observed differences.
An inverse association was found between country income level and the availability gap between groups of medicines, particularly in the public sector.
In low- and lower-middle income countries, drugs for acute conditions were 33.9% and 12.9% more available, respectively, in the public sector than medicines for chronic conditions.
Differences in availability were smaller in the private sector than in the public sector in all country income groups.


METHODS
This study followed an interrupted times-series design in which the number of drivers involved in injury collisions and of people injured in traffic collisions in Spain before and after the criminalization of offences were compared.
The data on road traffic injuries in 2000-2009 were obtained from the road traffic collision database of the General Traffic Directorate.
The dependent variables were stratified by sex, age, injury severity, type of road user, road type and time of collision.
Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted with adjustments for time trend, seasonality, previous interventions and national fuel consumption.

FINDINGS
The overall number of male drivers involved in injury collisions dropped (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.89-0.97) after the reform of the penal code, but among women no change was observed (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95-1.03).
In addition, 13 891 men (P < 0.01) were prevented from being injured.
Larger reductions were observed among young male drivers and among male motorcycle or moped riders than among the drivers of other vehicles.


FINDINGS
Twelve countries submitted 20 guidelines developed between 2004 and 2009.
Median scores were poor (i.e. <0.6) for the methodological quality domains of rigour of development, stakeholder involvement and applicability and flexibility.
Scores were better for the domains of scope and purpose (median: 0.82, interquartile range, IQR: 0.58-0.89) and clarity and presentation (median: 0.67, IQR: 0.50-0.78).
Concerning guideline content, recommended first-line treatment and eligibility criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) in adults were in line with WHO recommendations in most guidelines.
However, recommendations on antiretroviral prophylaxis for the prevention of vertical HIV transmission, diagnosis and treatment of HIV infection in infants, monitoring patients on ART, treatment failure and co-morbidities were often lacking.

CONCLUSION
The large majority of national HIV clinical practice guidelines had methodological weaknesses and content inaccuracies.


METHODS
The hybrid IFs system adds alternative structural formulations for causes not well served by regression models and accounts for changes in proximate health risk factors.
Forecasts are made to 2100 but findings are reported to 2060.

FINDINGS
The base model projects that deaths from communicable diseases (CDs) will decline by 50%, whereas deaths from both non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries will more than double.
Considerable cross-national convergence in life expectancy will occur.
Climate-induced fluctuations in agricultural yield will cause little excess childhood mortality from CDs, although other climate-health pathways were not explored.
An optimistic scenario will produce 39 million fewer deaths in 2060 than a pessimistic one.
Our forward linkage model suggests that an optimistic scenario would result in a 20% per cent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, despite one billion additional people.
Southern Asia would experience the greatest relative mortality reduction and the largest resulting benefit in per capita GDP.


METHODS
Trends in G2D rate were analysed for Brazil, China, India and Thailand and figures were compared with the WHO target: a 35% decrease by 2015 relative to the 2010 baseline.
To estimate the prevalence of G2D in 2015 and 2035 for each country three assumptions were made: (i) maintenance of the current trend; (ii) attainment of the WHO target, and (iii) reduction of G2D by 50% every 5 years relative to 2010.

FINDINGS
Since 1995, the G2D rate has decreased every 5 years in Brazil, China, India and Thailand by 12.7% (95% confidence interval, CI: 6.6-18.3), 7.7% (95% CI: 1.1-12.8), 53.7% (95% CI: 38.1-65.4) and 35.9% (95% CI: 23.4-46.3), respectively.
New cases with G2D detected after 2010 will contribute 15% (Brazil), 3% (China), 2.5% (India) and 4% (Thailand) to the total prevalence of G2D in 2015.
If no policies are changed, between 2015 and 2035, the prevalence of G2D will decrease by more than half in China, India and Thailand, and by 16% in Brazil.


METHODS
Using the opportunity provided by vaccination campaigns, the Brazilian government promotes Health and Nutrition Days to estimate the prevalence of anthropometric deficits in children.
Data collected in 2005-2006 for 22 375 impoverished children under 5 years of age were employed to estimate nutritional outcomes among recipients of Bolsa Família.
All variables under study, namely child birth weight, lack of birth certificate, educational level and gender of family head, access to piped water and electricity, height for age, weight for age and weight for height, were converted into binary variables for regression analysis.

CONCLUSION
Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.


METHODS
The modelled parameters consisted of clinical criteria, rapid HIV antibody testing and CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count.

FINDINGS
Positive and negative predictive values were between 61% and 97% and between 95% and 96%, respectively.


METHODS
Episodes of diarrhoeal disease in children aged under 5 years that occurred on one specified day each month between 2005 and 2006 were reported to community health workers for six rural villages.
A geographical information system containing details of household water use and sanitation in the villages was built using data obtained by a global positioning system survey.
The information system also included health, spatial and demographic data.
A field survey was carried out to determine whether households obtained drinking water from deep tube wells installed in 2005.
The effect of deep tube well use on the incidence of childhood diarrhoea was assessed using a random effects negative binomial regression model.

FINDINGS
Neither socioeconomic status, latrine density, population density nor study year had a significant influence on disease risk.
The incidence of childhood diarrhoea declined dramatically between 2005 and 2006, irrespective of water source.


RELEVANT CHANGES
The campaigns also included immunization education for both parents and teachers.

LESSONS LEARNT
The subsequent schoolbased strategy to overcome these barriers appears to be effective.


METHODS
This was a prospective non-randomized community intervention trial designed to test the provision of injectable contraceptives by community-based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs).
Effectiveness, safety, acceptability and continuation rates were the outcomes of interest.

FINDINGS
A total of 1062 women participated in the study.
In addition, clients of CBRHAs were less likely to discontinue using injectable contraceptives over three injection cycles than health post clients.


METHODS
The World Health Organization's Tool for Situation Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was distributed to health-care managers in facilities throughout the country.
Questionnaire data were complemented by interviews with health facility staff, Ministry of Health officials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations.

FINDINGS
Important deficits were identified in infrastructure, human resources, availability of essential supplies and ability to perform trauma, obstetric and general surgical procedures.
Of the 18 facilities expected to perform surgical procedures, 50.0% had interruptions in water supply and 55.6% in electricity.
Only 38.9% of facilities had a surgeon and only 16.7% had a physician anaesthetist.
All facilities had limited ability to perform basic trauma and general surgical procedures.
Of public facilities, 54.5% could not perform laparotomy and 58.3% could not repair a hernia.
Only 25.0% of them could manage an open fracture and 41.7% could perform an emergency procedure for an obstructed airway.


FINDINGS
Positive trends were noted in urbanization, availability of electricity, age at first marriage, use of modern contraception, access to skilled antenatal care, child vaccination, knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and overweight and obesity.
In contrast, negative trends were seen in factors such as literacy, infant and child mortality, fertility rate, home delivery and malnutrition and underweight.
However, changes in these indicators differed between the poorest and richest quintiles.
For instance, only the richest quintile experienced rapid urbanization, whereas illiteracy declined more among the poorest.
Noteworthy gaps were found in almost all factors.
Rich-poor gaps in urbanization, age at marriage, fertility, condom use, home delivery and overweight increased; in contrast, gaps in education, water and sanitation, use of contraception (except condoms) and child vaccination declined.

CONCLUSION
Persistent inequities in Bangladesh endanger equitable and sustainable human development in the country.


FINDINGS
The mean adherence rate in the study population was 96.3% (standard deviation, SD: 7.7).
Adherence was less than 100% in 70% of the patients, less than 95% in 21% of them, and less than 80% in 2%.
The ACTG adherence questionnaire and urine colour test had the highest sensitivities but lowest specificities.
The Morisky scale and refill visits had the highest specificities but lowest sensitivities.
Pill counts and refill visits combined, used in routine practice, yielded moderate sensitivity and specificity, but sensitivity improved when the ACTG adherence questionnaire was added.

CONCLUSION
Patients on community-based DOT showed good adherence in this study.
The combination of pill counts, refill visits and the ACTG adherence questionnaire could be used to monitor adherence in settings where MEMS is not affordable.
The findings with regard to adherence and to the validity of simple adherence measures should be confirmed in larger populations with wider variability in adherence rates.


METHODS
Faith-based organization capacity, human resources, health programme sustainability/barriers and community members' knowledge were evaluated.

FINDINGS
The delivery of a CVD prevention programme in faith-based organizations by CHWs is feasible.


METHODS
Of 37 444 deliveries in women with low-risk pregnancies, 1847 (4.9%) were electively induced.
The factors associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes among cases of spontaneous and induced onset of labour were compared.
Adjustment using multiple logistic regression models followed these analyses.

FINDINGS
Of 11 077 cases of induced labour, 1847 (16.7%) were elective.
Elective inductions occurred in 4.9% of women with low-risk pregnancies (37 444).
Oxytocin was the most common method used (83% of cases), either alone or combined with another.
Perinatal outcomes were satisfactory except for a 22% higher risk of delayed breastfeeding (i.e. initiation between 1 hour and 7 days postpartum).


OBJECTIVE
To compare the impact of three strategies for delivering a booster dose of adult-formulated tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) vaccine to adolescents in Australia.

METHODS
A series of ecologic analyses of pertussis notifications during epidemic periods in relevant age cohorts were conducted.


FINDINGS
Falls accounted for 25% (2003/8023) of all deaths from unintentional injury and were the second leading cause of such deaths.
An estimated 160 000 fall-related deaths occurred in India in 2005; of these, nearly 20 000 were in children aged 0-14 years.
The unintentional-fall-related mortality rate (MR) per 100 000 population was 14.5 (99% confidence interval, CI: 13.7-15.4).
Rates were similar for males and females at 14.9 (99% CI: 13.7-16.0) and 14.2 (99% CI: 13.1-15.4) per 100 000 population, respectively.
People aged 70 years or older had the highest mortality rate from unintentional falls (MR: 271.2; 99% CI: 249.0-293.5), and the rate was higher among women (MR: 281; 99% CI: 249.7-311.3).
Falls on the same level were the most common among older adults, whereas falls from heights were more common in younger age groups.

CONCLUSION
In India, unintentional falls are a major public health problem that disproportionately affects older women and children.
The contexts in which these falls occur and the resulting morbidity and disability need to be better understood.
In India there is an urgent need to develop, test and implement interventions aimed at preventing falls.


METHODS
Three databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the WHO regional medical database for Africa) were searched to identify studies published from 1995 to 2009 on the epidemiology of HAI in African countries.
No language restriction was applied.
Available abstract books of leading international infection control conferences were also searched from 2004 to 2009.

FINDINGS
The eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review were met by 19 articles, only 2 of which met the criterion of high quality.


METHODS
Thirty-two areas endemic for JE in 24 Asian and Western Pacific countries were sorted into 10 incidence groups on the basis of published data and expert opinion.
Population-based surveillance studies using laboratory-confirmed cases were sought for each incidence group by a computerized search of the scientific literature.
When no eligible studies existed for a particular incidence group, incidence data were extrapolated from related groups.

CONCLUSION
Recent data allowed us to refine the estimate of the global incidence of JE, which remains substantial despite improvements in vaccination coverage.
More and better incidence studies in selected countries, particularly China and India, are needed to further refine these estimates.


METHODS
Eleven of the 14 municipalities in Guangdong province participated.
A total of 494 680 women who delivered during 2004-2008 were studied.

FINDINGS
In 2008, 54 196 pregnant women (43.1%) were not screened for syphilis.
Among such women, 32 863 (60.6%) attended clinics without any syphilis testing capacity and 21 333 (39.4%) attended clinics that performed testing but were not screened.
The likelihood of not having syphilis test capacity was much higher for hygiene stations (odds ratio, OR: 10; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4-25), services at the township level (OR: 33; 95% CI: 10-100) and services with < 1000 deliveries per year (OR: 1.002; 95% CI: 1.001-1.003).
These same service characteristics correlated with lower screening coverage rates (P < 0.01).
Only one antenatal clinic had the capacity to conduct both treponemal and non-treponemal tests for diagnosing syphilis.


METHODS
The data in this study were derived from two sources: the Thai Survey of Population Changes (SPC) 2005-2006, a consecutive multi-round household survey conducted over a 12-month period, and Thailand's vital registration records.
SPC death entries for people of all ages were matched to 2005-2006 death records from vital registration.
The principles of a dual records system were applied to estimate the magnitude of under-registration of deaths, classified by age and sex, using the Chandrasekaran-Deming formula.

FINDINGS
Overall under-registration of deaths during 2005-2006 was 9.00% (95% confidence interval, CI: 8.95-9.05) for males and 8.36% (95% CI: 8.31-8.41) for females.


METHODS
This prospective study included pregnant women registered in health stations in randomly-selected communes in Ha Nam province.
At recruitment (< 20 weeks of gestation), sociodemographic factors, reproductive health, intimate partner relationship, family violence, symptoms of common mental disorders and use of micronutrient supplements were assessed.
During a second assessment (> 28 weeks of gestation) a urine specimen was collected to measure urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and iodized salt use was assessed.
Predictors were explored through univariable analyses and multivariable linear and logistic regression.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the global burden of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) after pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), specifically in cases with pulmonary cavitation.

CONCLUSION
The global burden of CPA as a sequel to PTB is substantial and warrants further investigation.
CPA could account for some cases of smear-negative PTB.
Since CPA responds to long-term antifungal therapy, improved case detection should be urgently undertaken.


METHODS
Women in 20 African countries who had induced abortions between 1994 and 2008 were identified in Demographic and Health Surveys.

CONCLUSION
The induced abortion rate in sub-Saharan Africa rose in high-exposure countries relative to low-exposure countries when the Mexico City Policy was reintroduced.
Reduced financial support for family planning may have led women to substitute abortion for contraception.
Regardless of one's views about abortion, the findings may have important implications for public policies governing abortion.


METHODS
Coverage data for child and maternal health services in 28 sub-Saharan African countries were obtained from the 2000-2008 Demographic Health Survey.
For each country, the national coverage gap was determined for an overall health service coverage index and select individual health service indicators.


Title
Diagnostic

CONCLUSION
Visible severe wasting failed to detect approximately half of the children admitted to hospital with severe acute malnutrition diagnosed anthropometrically.


FINDINGS
The estimated incidence of SARI associated with influenza in children < 5 years old was 6.7 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0-18.3); 4.4 (95% CI: 0-13.4) and 6.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 0-8.3/1000) during the 2008, 2009 and 2010 influenza seasons, respectively.
The incidence of SARI in people aged > 5 years was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.4-2.0) and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.5-2.2) per 10 000 person-years during 2009 and 2010, respectively.

CONCLUSION
Influenza-like illness is a frequent cause of consultation in the outpatient setting in Bangladesh.
Children aged less than 5 years are hospitalized for influenza in greater proportions than children in other age groups.


FINDINGS
In 2008, 64.1% of urban women and 11.3% of women in the poorest rural region reported giving birth by caesarean section.
A fast rise was occurring in all socioeconomic groups.
Between 1993 and 2008, the risk of caesarean section had increased more than threefold in urban areas (relative risk, RR: 3.63; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.61-5.04) and more than 15-fold in rural areas (RR: 15.46; 95% CI: 10.46-22.86).
Socioeconomic region of residence was a more important driver of the caesarean section rate than individual socioeconomic status.


FINDINGS
Between 1996 and 2008 the annual incidence of hospital admission resulting from poisoning by medicinal or biological substances increased exponentially, from 48.2 to 115.4 admissions per 100 000 population.
Over the same period, annual admissions resulting from poisoning with pesticides decreased from 105.1 to 88.9 per 100 000.
The annual incidence of suicide decreased exponentially, from a peak of 47.0 per 100 000 in 1995 to 19.6 per 100 000 in 2009.
Poisoning accounted for 37.4 suicides per 100 000 population in 1995 but only 11.2 suicides per 100 000 in 2009.
The case fatality rate for pesticide poisoning decreased linearly, from 11.0 deaths per 100 cases admitted to hospital in 1997 to 5.1 per 100 in 2008.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Category II retreatment regimen is no longer used in Georgia.


METHODS
Health inequalities between the Māori and non-Māori populations in New Zealand were used by way of illustration.

FINDINGS
Seven of the top 10 risk factors prioritized for research on preventive interventions in New Zealand were also among the 10 risk factors most highly ranked as contributing to DALYs in high-income countries of the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Region.
The final list of priority risk factors included tobacco use; alcohol use; high blood pressure; high blood cholesterol; overweight/obesity, and physical inactivity.
All of these factors contributed to health inequalities.
Effective interventions for preventing all of them are available, and for each risk factor there is at least one documented cost-saving preventive intervention.


METHODS
Routine data were collected from health centre records at the end of 2007; they included 249 births in Same, Manufahi district, and 1986 births in Lospalos, Lautem district.

FINDINGS
Most facility-based births in Same (80%) and Lospalos (62%) were among women who lived within 5 km of the health centre.
There was no significant increase in the number of facility-based births among women in more remote areas following implementation of the maternity waiting homes.


FINDINGS
The remaining three provinces reported increases in maternal deaths.


CONCLUSION
Cotrimoxazole significantly increased survival in HIV-infected adults on ART.


METHODS
All study designs were included.

FINDINGS
Thirteen papers covering 17 low- and lower-middle-income countries provided findings for pregnant women, and 34, for women who had just given birth.
Data on disorders in the antenatal period were available for 9 (8%) countries, and on disorders in the postnatal period, for 17 (15%).


METHODS
The study involved 58 antenatal clinics and 20 delivery wards (37 urban, 21 rural and 20 semi-urban) in KwaZulu-Natal province that provided PMTCT services and reported data to the District Health Information System.
The data improvement intervention, which was implemented between May 2008 and March 2009, involved training on data collection and feedback for health information personnel and programme managers, monthly data reviews and data audits at health-care facilities.
Data on six data elements used to monitor PMTCT services and recorded in the information system were compared with source data from health facility registers before, during and after the intervention.
Data completeness (i.e. their presence in the system) and accuracy (i.e. being within 10% of their true value) were evaluated.

FINDINGS
The level of data completeness increased from 26% before to 64% after the intervention.
Similarly, the proportion of data in the information system considered accurate increased from 37% to 65% (P < 0.0001).
Moreover, the correlation between data in the information system and those from facility registers rose from 0.54 to 0.92.


FINDINGS
Of the 59 countries that responded, 81%, 75%, 54% and 14% had a policy for the CCM of diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia and neonatal infections, respectively.
Only three (6%) of the 53 malaria-endemic countries providing responses had policies for all four of these conditions, although 17 (32%) had CCM policies for malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia.
Some CCM of childhood illnesses was being implemented - more commonly for diarrhoea and malaria than for pneumonia or neonatal infections - in 88% of the countries providing responses.
According to the responses received, CHWs administered the recommended treatments for diarrhoea, malaria or pneumonia in 34% (17/50), 100% (41/41) and 100% (34/34) of the countries implementing CCM of these conditions, respectively.
Common programme concerns were drug supplies, quality of care and CHW incentives, training and supervision.

CONCLUSION
Despite progress, further efforts are needed towards policy reform and the expansion of CCM programmes.
Ensuring the availability of recommended medicines and operational research, to assure quality, remain priorities.


METHODS
Identical surveys were sent to referee laboratories for quality control.
Materials were prepared, packaged and shipped in accordance with standard protocols.

FINDINGS
Between 2002 and 2009, participation increased from 30 to 48 Member States of the WHO and from 39 to 78 laboratories.
Each survey was returned by 64-93% of participants.
Mean turnaround time was 25.9 days.
For bacterial enteric diseases and meningitis components, bacterial identification was acceptable in 65% and 69% of challenges, respectively, but serotyping and antibiotic susceptibility testing and reporting were frequently unacceptable.
Microscopy was acceptable for 73% of plague challenges.
Tuberculosis microscopy was satisfactorily performed, with 87% of responses receiving acceptable scores.
In the malaria component, 82% of responses received acceptable scores for species identification but only 51% of parasite quantitation scores were acceptable.


FINDINGS
There was only a slight reduction in Jordan.
Microbial contamination was more common than chemical contamination.

CONCLUSION
Monitoring drinking-water supplies by recording both access to water sources and their safety would be a substantial improvement.


METHODS
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for influenza viruses using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
In the calculation of annual rates, adjustments were made for enrolled patients who did not have swabs tested for influenza virus.

FINDINGS
The annual rate of hospitalization (per 100000 population) was 699.8 among patients with respiratory illness and 56.2 among patients with influenza (with 143.7, 18.8, 55.2, 65.1 and 57.3 hospitalized patients with influenza virus per 100000 people aged <5, 5-19, 20-34, 35-49 and >50 years, respectively).


FINDINGS
Timely interventions could substantially alter the time-course and reduce the severity of pandemic influenza in Mongolia.
In a moderate pandemic scenario, early social distancing measures decreased the mean attack rate from around 10% to 7-8%.
Similarly, in a severe pandemic scenario such measures cut the mean attack rate from approximately 23% to 21%.
Targeted antiviral campaigns generally appeared more effective in severe pandemic scenarios than in moderate pandemic scenarios.

CONCLUSION
A mathematical model of pandemic influenza transmission in Mongolia indicated that, to be successful, interventions to prevent transmission must be triggered when the first cases are detected in border regions.
If social distancing measures are introduced at this stage and implemented over several weeks, they may have a notable mitigating impact.
In low-income regions such as Mongolia, social distancing may be more effective than the large-scale use of antivirals.


METHODS
In four hospitals in Bangladesh, respiratory samples were collected twice a month throughout 2009 from inpatients aged <5 years with severe pneumonia and from older inpatients with severe acute respiratory infection.
The samples were tested for influenza virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) using polymerase chain reaction.
The deaths in 2009 in five randomly selected unions (the smallest administrative units in Bangladesh) in each hospital's catchment area were then investigated using formal records and informal group discussions.
The deaths of those who had reportedly died within 14 days of suddenly developing fever with cough and/or a sore throat were assumed to be influenza-associated.
The rate of such deaths in 2009 in each of the catchment areas was then estimated from the number of apparently influenza-associated deaths in the sampled unions, the proportion of the sampled inpatients in the local hospital who tested positive for influenza virus RNA, and the estimated number of residents of the sampled unions.

FINDINGS
Of the 2500 people known to have died in 2009 in all 20 study unions, 346 (14%) reportedly had fever with cough and/or sore throat within 14 days of their deaths.
The estimated mean annual influenza-associated mortality in these unions was 11 per 100000 population: 1.5, 4.0 and 125 deaths per 100000 among those aged <5, 5-59 and >59 years, respectively.


METHODS
Influenza-associated excess mortality for the period 2003-2008 was estimated in three cities in temperate northern China and five cities in the subtropical south of the country.
The estimates were derived from models based on negative binomial regressions, vital statistics and the results of weekly influenza virus surveillance.

FINDINGS
Annual influenza-associated excess mortality, for all causes, was 18.0 (range: 10.9-32.7) deaths per 100000 population in the northern cities and 11.3 (range: 7.3-17.8) deaths per 100000 in the southern cities.
Excess mortality for respiratory and circulatory disease was 12.4 (range: 7.4-22.2) and 8.8 (range: 5.5-13.6) deaths per 100000 people in the northern and southern cities, respectively.
Most (86%) deaths occurred among people aged >65 years.
Influenza-associated excess mortality was higher in B-virus-dominant seasons than in seasons when A(H3N2) or A(H1N1) predominated, and more than half of all influenza-associated mortality was associated with influenza B virus.


RELEVANT CHANGES
From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team.
These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but "owned" by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness.
The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex.
The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization.

LESSONS LEARNT
The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication.
European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.


METHODS
In Zambia's Southern province, dried samples of blood from infants are sent to regional laboratories to be tested for HIV with polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Turnaround times for the postal notification of the results of such tests to 10 health facilities over 19 months were evaluated by retrospective data collection.
SMS system data were collected over a 7.5-month period for all infant dried blood samples used for HIV testing in the 10 study facilities.

FINDINGS
The reduction in turnaround time was statistically significant in nine (90%) facilities.
Only 0.5% of the texted reports investigated differed from the corresponding paper reports.


METHODS
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for reviews published between 1 January 1995 and 17 March 2009.
Studies had to be systematic reviews, narrative reviews, qualitative metasyntheses or meta-ethnographies of e-health implementation.
Abstracts and papers were double screened and data were extracted on country of origin; e-health domain; publication date; aims and methods; databases searched; inclusion and exclusion criteria and number of papers included.
Data were analysed qualitatively using normalization process theory as an explanatory coding framework.

FINDINGS
Inclusion criteria were met by 37 papers; 20 had been published between 1995 and 2007 and 17 between 2008 and 2009.
Methodological quality was poor: 19 papers did not specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 13 did not indicate the precise number of articles screened.


RELEVANT CHANGES
From June 2006 to October 2011, 782 773 electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use.

LESSONS LEARNT
If applied to health problems for which care is in high demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to improve patient access to specialized health care.


LOCAL SETTING
To test the hypothesis at the national and district levels a project to strengthen the HMIS was established in Zanzibar.


METHODS
A Bayesian network was represented by a graph composed of 38 nodes (one for each district in the Niger) connected by arrows.
In the graph, each node directly influenced each of the "child" nodes that lay at the ends of the arrows arising from that node, according to conditional probabilities.
The probabilities between "influencing" and "influenced" districts were estimated by analysis of databases that held weekly records of meningitis outbreaks in the Niger between 1986 and 2005.
For each week of interest, each district was given a Boolean-variable score of 1 (if meningitis incidence in the district reached an epidemic threshold in that week) or 0.


METHODS
In total, 1014 women were recruited after hospital discharge and followed for up to 4 years: 337 had near-miss complications and 677 had uncomplicated pregnancies.
Significant differences in mortality between the groups were assessed using Fisher's exact test.

FINDINGS
In the 4 years, 15 (5.3%) women died in the near-miss group and 5 (0.9%) died after uncomplicated pregnancies (P < 0.001).
More than half the deaths after a near miss, but none after an uncomplicated delivery, were pregnancy-related.
Indirect factors contributed to many of these deaths, particularly human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Relatives' accounts suggested that the high cost and poor quality of health care, a lack of follow-up care and an unmet need for contraception contributed to the excess mortality in the near-miss group.


METHODS
Study data came from a 2007 nationally-representative cross-sectional survey of 10 293 adults aged 64 to 75 years.
The effect of reduced cost sharing was estimated using a regression discontinuity design.

FINDINGS
For adults aged 70 to 75 years whose income made them ineligible for reduced cost sharing, neither out-of-pocket spending nor health outcomes differed from the values expected on the basis of the trend observed in 64- to 69-year-olds.
However, for eligible adults aged 70 to 75 years, out-of-pocket spending was significantly lower (P < 0.001) and mental health was significantly better (P < 0.001) than expected.
These differences emerged abruptly at the age of 70 years.
Moreover, the mental health benefits were similar in individuals who were and were not using health-care services (P = 0.502 for interaction).
The improvement in physical health after the age of 70 years in adults eligible for reduced cost-sharing tended to be greater than in non-eligible adults (P = 0.084).


METHODS
Data were collected on all acute poisoning cases admitted to 34 primary and 1 referral hospital in Anuradhapura district from September 2008 to January 2010.
Three admission data sets were compared with the "true" incidence of acute poisoning to determine the systematic bias inherent to each data set.
"True" incidence was calculated by adding all direct admissions (not transfers) to primary hospitals and to the referral hospital.
The three data sets were: (i) all admissions to primary hospitals only; (ii) all admissions to the referral hospital only (direct and referrals), and (iii) all admissions to both primary hospitals and the referral hospital ("all admissions").
The third is the government's routine statistical method but counts transfers twice, so for the study transferred patients were counted only once through data linkage.

FINDINGS
Of 3813 patients admitted for poisoning, 3111 first presented to a primary hospital and 2287 (73.5%) were later transferred to the referral hospital, where most deaths (161/177) occurred.
Admissions to primary hospitals only or to the referral hospital only underestimated the incidence of acute poisoning by about 20%, and data on "all admissions" overestimated it by 60%.


FINDINGS
There were 27 166 medical visits by 7642 Iraqi refugees (mean age: 37.4 years; 49% male; 70% from Baghdad; 6% disabled; 3% with a history of torture).
Chronic diseases were common, including essential hypertension (22% of refugees), visual disturbances (12%), joint disorders (11%) and type II diabetes mellitus (11%).
The most common reasons for seeking acute care were upper respiratory tract infection (11%), supervision of normal pregnancy (4%) and urinary disorders (3%).
The conditions requiring the highest number of visits per refugee were cerebrovascular disease (1.46 visits), senile cataract (1.46) and glaucoma (1.44).
Sponsored care included 31 747 referrals or consultations to a specialty service, 18 432 drug dispensations, 2307 laboratory studies and 1090 X-rays.
The specialties most commonly required were ophthalmology, dentistry, gynaecology and orthopaedic surgery.


METHODS
Multiple logistic regression was used to check for a potential association between caesarean rates and rates of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

FINDINGS
The caesarean delivery rate ranged from 53.5% to 56.1% in 2001-2004 and from 43.9% to 36.1% in 2005-2011.
When 2001-2004 and 2005-2011 were treated as "before" and "after" periods to evaluate the intervention's impact on the mean caesarean section rate, a significant reduction was noted: from 54.8% to 40.3% (odds ratio, OR: 0.56; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.52-0.59; χ2 test: P < 0.001).
The overall drop in the caesarean section rate was significant (χ2 test: P < 0.001) and inversely correlated with the years (Spearman's ρ: -0.096; P < 0.001).
Although complicated pregnancies increased after 2004, the primary caesarean section rate decreased annually by 20% on average in 2005-2011, after practice audits were implemented.
Multiple logistic regression showed a positive association between the caesarean delivery rate and the rate of admission to the NICU (adjusted OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.14-1.40).


METHODS
The reduction in the modelled annual incidence of transmission that was attributable to this "test" intervention was compared with that seen with an alternative intervention.

CONCLUSION
Although it did not appear markedly more effective than the alternative intervention, the test intervention may still be more feasible and therefore worthwhile.


Title
Improved and standardized method for assessing years lived with disability after injury.

FINDINGS
Overall, 87 weights and proportions for 27 injury diagnoses involving lifelong consequences were included in the method.
Almost all of the injuries investigated (96-100%) could be assigned to EUROCOST categories.
The mean number of YLD per case of injury varied with the country studied.


METHODS
Lifetime ART (US$ 6883), recommended for pregnant women with < 350 CD4+ T lymphocytes per mm3, was assumed to give the same reduction in transmission risk in each subsequent pregnancy.


METHODS
The MEASURE DHS web site was searched for information on all population-based surveys completed under the DHS project between 1984 and 2010.
The information collected included the country, type of survey, survey design, fieldwork period and certain special features, such as inclusion of biomarkers.
A search of PubMed was also conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published during 2010 that analysed DHS data and included an English-language abstract.
Trends in data availability and in the use of DHS data for research were assessed through descriptive, graphical and bivariate linear regression analyses.

FINDINGS
In total, 236 household surveys under the DHS project were completed across 84 countries during 2010.
The number of surveys per year has remained constant, although the scope of the survey questions has expanded.
The inclusion criteria were met by 1117 peer-reviewed publications.
The number of publications has increased progressively over the last quarter century, with an average annual increment of 4.3 (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.2-5.3) publications.
Trends in the number of peer-reviewed publications based on the use of DHS data were highly correlated with trends in funding for health by the Government of the United States of America and globally.


RELEVANT CHANGES
In 2011, Rwanda's HPV vaccination programme achieved 93.23% coverage after the first three-dose course of vaccination among girls in grade six.
A nationwide sensitization campaign preceded delivery of the first dose.

LESSONS LEARNT
Through a series of innovative partnerships, Rwanda reduced the historical two-decade gap in vaccine introduction between high- and low-income countries to just five years.
High coverage rates were achieved due to a delivery strategy that built on Rwanda's strong vaccination system and human resources framework.
Following the GAVI Alliance's decision to begin financing HPV vaccination, Rwanda's example should motivate other countries to explore universal HPV vaccine coverage, although implementation must be tailored to the local context.


METHODS
Data on men aged 15 to 64 years were derived from the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey, which involved interviews and blood collection to test for HIV and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2).
The prevalence of HIV infection and circumcision in Kenyan provinces was calculated and the demographic characteristics and sexual behaviour of circumcised and uncircumcised, HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men were recorded.

FINDINGS
The national prevalence of HIV infection in uncircumcised men was 13.2% (95% confidence interval, CI: 10.8-15.7) compared with 3.9% (95% CI: 3.3-4.5) among circumcised men.
Nyanza province had the largest estimated number of uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men (i.e. 601 709), followed by Rift Valley, Nairobi and Western Province, respectively, and most belonged to the Luo ethnic tribe.
Of these men, 77.8% did not know their HIV status and 33.2% were HSV-2-positive.
In addition, 65.3% had had unprotected sex with a partner of discordant or unknown HIV status in the past 12 months and only 14.7% consistently used condoms with their most recent partner.
However, only 21.8% of the uncircumcised, HIV-uninfected men aged 15 to 19 years were sexually active.


FINDINGS
Of the African countries reviewed, 42 (79.2%) had adopted a PITC policy.
Of the 42, all recommended PITC for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, 66.7% recommended it for tuberculosis clinics and patients, and 45.2% for sexually transmitted infection clinics.
Moreover, 43.6% adopted PITC in 2005 or 2006.
The literature search identified 11 studies on patients' experiences of and views about PITC in clinical settings in Africa.
The clear majority regarded PITC as acceptable.
However, women in antenatal clinics were not always aware that they had the right to decline an HIV test.

CONCLUSION
Policy and practice on HIV testing and counselling in Africa has shifted from a cautious approach that emphasizes confidentiality to greater acceptance of the routine offer of HIV testing.
The introduction of PITC in clinical settings has contributed to increased HIV testing in several of these settings.
Most patients regard PITC as acceptable.
However, other approaches are needed to reach people who do not consult health-care services.


CONCLUSION
The shift in the CD4+ threshold for ART initiation will substantially increase the demand for ART in Ethiopia.


METHODS
Papers describing qualitative studies, case studies, process evaluations and cost-effectiveness studies linked to an eligible paper were also included.

FINDINGS
A total of 32 papers describing 20 African studies were reviewed.
Many delivery strategies involved health sectors and retail outlets (partial subsidy), antenatal care clinics (full subsidy) and campaigns (full subsidy).
Strategies achieving high ownership among households and use among children < 5 delivered ITNs free through campaigns.
Costs were largely comparable across strategies; ITNs were the main cost.
Cost-effectiveness estimates were most sensitive to the assumed net lifespan and leakage.
Common barriers to delivery included cost, stock-outs and poor logistics.
Common facilitators were staff training and supervision, cooperation across departments or ministries and stakeholder involvement.


METHODS
Study quality was assessed with a quality grading protocol.

FINDINGS
Inclusion criteria were met by 159 studies - 68 in Africa and 91 in Asia.
Most African studies reported on community-based health insurance (CBHI) and were of relatively high quality; social health insurance (SHI) studies were mostly Asian and of medium quality.
Only one Asian study dealt with private health insurance (PHI).
Most studies were observational; four had randomized controls and 20 had a quasi-experimental design.
Financial protection, utilization and social inclusion were far more common subjects than resource mobilization, quality of care or community empowerment.
Strong evidence shows that CBHI and SHI improve service utilization and protect members financially by reducing their out-of-pocket expenditure, and that CBHI improves resource mobilization too.
The effect of SHI and CBHI on community empowerment is inconclusive.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Of 1214 HIV-exposed infants, 71.6% presented for early diagnosis, and 14.5% of those who presented tested positive for HIV.
Further testing of 103 of these 126 apparently HIV-positive infants confirmed infection in 88; the other 15 results were false positives.
The initial polymerase chain reaction testing of dried blood spots had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.4%.
Despite active tracing, only 87.3% (110/126) of the mothers of infants who initially tested positive were told their infants' test results.
ART was initiated in 58% of the infants with confirmed HIV infection.

LESSONS LEARNT
Early infant diagnosis of HIV infection at the primary care level in a resource-poor setting is challenging.
Many children in the HIV diagnosis and treatment programme were lost to follow-up at various stages.


METHODS
We surveyed more than 23 000 child deaths from a nationally representative survey of 1.1 million Indian households during 2001-2003.
Diarrhoeal deaths were characterized by region, age and sex and were combined with the proportion of deaths attributable to rotavirus, as determined by hospital microbiologic data collected by the Indian Rotavirus Strain Surveillance Network from December 2005 to November 2007.
Rotavirus vaccine efficacy data from clinical trials in developing countries were used to estimate the number of deaths preventable by a national vaccination programme.
Data were analysed using Stata SE version 10.

FINDINGS
Rotavirus caused an estimated 113 000 deaths (99% confidence interval, CI: 86 000-155 000); 50% (54 700) and 75% (85 400) occurred before one and two years of age, respectively.
One child in 242 died from rotavirus infection before five years of age.
Rotavirus-associated mortality rates overall, among girls and among boys were 4.14 (99% CI: 3.14-5.68), 4.89 (99% CI: 3.75-6.79) and 3.45 (99% CI: 2.58-4.66) deaths per 1000 live births, respectively.
Rates were highest in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, which together accounted for > 50% of deaths (64 400) nationally.
Rotavirus vaccine could prevent 41 000-48 000 deaths among children aged 3-59 months.


METHODS
The global cost of correcting URE was estimated using data on the population, the prevalence of URE and the number of existing refractive care practitioners in individual countries, the cost of establishing and operating educational programmes for practitioners and the cost of establishing and operating refractive care facilities.
The assumptions made ensured that costs were not underestimated and an upper limit to the costs was derived using the most expensive extreme for each assumption.

FINDINGS
Approximately 47 000 additional full-time functional clinical refractionists and 18 000 ophthalmic dispensers would be required to provide refractive care services for these individuals.
The estimated loss in global gross domestic product due to distance vision impairment caused by URE was US$ 202 000 million annually.


METHODS
An epidemic model of tuberculosis specifying discrete steps along the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway was constructed.
The influence of contextual factors on the projected epidemic impact of the new diagnostic tool over the decade following introduction was explored.

FINDINGS
With the use of smear microscopy, the incidence of tuberculosis will decline by an average of 3.94% per year.
If the new tool is added, incidence will decline by an annual 4.25%.
This represents an absolute change of 0.31 percentage points (95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.42).
However, the annual decline in transmission with use of the new tool is less when existing strategies for the diagnosis of smear-negative cases have high sensitivity and when symptomatic individuals delay in seeking care.
Other influential contextual factors include access to tuberculosis care, patient loss before diagnosis, initial patient default after diagnosis and treatment success rate.


METHODS
A prospective cohort study included 3704 HIV-negative women who were enrolled in two biomedical trials that tested two vaginal microbicides (PRO 2000 and Carraguard®) for the prevention of HIV-1 in Durban, South Africa, in 2004-2009.
Cox proportional hazards regression models along with partial population attributable risks (PARs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the relative population-level impact of the use of hormonal contraceptives on HIV-1 seroconversion rates and on pregnancy rates.

FINDINGS
Women who reported using hormonal contraceptives at enrolment in the trial had a higher risk of HIV-1 seroconversion (adjusted hazards ratio: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.97-1.58) than women who reported using other types of contraceptives at enrolment.
At the population level, the use of hormonal contraceptives (pills or injectables) at baseline and during study follow-up accounted for approximately 20% (95% CI: 16-22) of HIV-1 seroconversions.
However, the partial PAR indicated a relative impact of 12% (95% CI: 9.0-15.7).
On the other hand, 72% (95% CI: 66-77) of the pregnancies could have been avoided if all women had used hormonal contraceptives.


METHODS
Performance indicators were assessed for 167 VMMC providers.

FINDINGS
The adverse event rate was 0.1% intra-operatively and 2.1% post-operatively among clinic system participants (n = 3705), and 7.5% post-operatively among participants under active surveillance (n = 1449).
Agreement between systems was moderate (κ: 0.20; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.09-0.32).
Providers who performed more than 100 procedures achieved an adverse event rate of 0.7% and 4.3% in the clinic and active surveillance systems, respectively, and had decreased odds of performing a procedure resulting in an adverse event.
With provider experience, the mean duration of the procedure also dropped from 24.0 to 15.5 minutes.
Among providers who had performed at least 100 procedures, nurses and clinicians provided equivalent services.


METHODS
Residents of the study area who were hospitalized for any acute medical condition for at least one night between May 2009 and April 2011 were enrolled.
Respiratory specimens were collected and tested for influenza viruses in a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The PCR results were taken as the "gold standard" in evaluating the performance of several case definitions.

FINDINGS
Of the 3179 patients included in the final analysis, 21% (665) were PCR-positive for influenza virus, 96% reported fever and 4% reported shortness of breath.
The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for severe acute respiratory illness had a sensitivity of 11% among patients aged < 5 years and of 3% among older patients.
When shortness of breath was excluded from the definition, sensitivities increased (to 69% and 70%, respectively) and corresponding specificities of 43% and 53% were recorded.
Among patients aged ≥ 5 years, WHO's definition of a case of influenza-like illness had a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 53%.
The addition of "cough and reported or measured fever" increased sensitivity to 80% but decreased specificity to 42%.


METHODS
Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses based on generalized linear models were performed within a trial set in 24 public and private primary-care facilities.
Subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm.
Eligible subjects in the intervention arm were given psycho-education, case management, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or antidepressants by lay health workers.
Subjects in the control arm were treated by physicians.
The use of health-care resources, the disability of each subject and degree of psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule, were determined at 2, 6 and 12 months.

FINDINGS
Complete data, from all three follow-ups, were collected from 1243 (75.4%) and 938 (81.7%) of the subjects enrolled in the study facilities from the public and private sectors, respectively.
Within the public facilities, subjects in the intervention arm showed greater improvement in all the health outcomes investigated than those in the control arm.
Time costs were also significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm, whereas health system costs in the two arms were similar.
Within the private facilities, however, the effectiveness and costs recorded in the two arms were similar.


METHODS
The mixed methods study began with a cross-sectional survey in Karachi, Pakistan.
Descriptive and bivariate analyses by ethnic and socioeconomic group were performed for quantitative data; thematic analysis was conducted for qualitative interviews with Pashtun parents.

FINDINGS
Of 1017 parents surveyed, 412 (41%) had never heard of polio; 132 (13%) did not participate in one SIA and 157 (15.4%) did not participate in either SIA.
Among non-participants, 34 (21.6%) reported not having been contacted by a vaccinator; 116 (73.9%) reported having refused to participate, and 7 (4.5%) reported that the child was absent from home when the vaccinator visited.
Refusals clustered in low-income Pashtun (43/441; 9.8%) and high-income families of any ethnic background (71/153; 46.4%).
Low-income Pashtuns were more likely to not have participated in polio SIAs than low-income non-Pashtuns (odds ratio, OR: 7.1; 95% confidence interval, CI: 3.47-14.5).
Reasons commonly cited among Pashtuns for refusing vaccination included fear of sterility; lack of faith in the polio vaccine; scepticism about the vaccination programme, and fear that the vaccine might contain religiously forbidden ingredients.


METHODS
Geographic coordinates were compiled for 113 active mines, 138 ore processing plants and 3 smelters, as well as 7743 former mining sites.
The population living within 5 km of these sites was calculated from census data for 2000.

CONCLUSION
Soil contamination with lead is likely to be extensive in Peruvian mining towns but the level of contamination is spatially far from uniform.


METHODS
A retrospective cohort analysis of infants living in Keneba, in rural Gambia, was conducted.

FINDINGS
Of 2876 infants included in the analysis, 40 died before the age of 12 months.
The HR for death in this group versus in well-nourished infants was 5.8 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6-21) for a WFLz < -3.
HRs for MUACs below the thresholds of 115 mm, 110 mm and 105 mm were 4.5 (95% CI: 1.4-15), 9.5 (95% CI: 2.6-35) and 23 (95% CI: 4.2-122), respectively.
The attributable fractions for a MUAC < 130 mm and a WFLz < 0 were 51% and 13%, respectively.
The areas under the ROC curve for death in infancy were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46 to 0.64) for WFLz and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55 to 0.73) for MUAC.


OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect of weekly low-dose vitamin A supplementation on cause-specific mortality in women of reproductive age in Ghana.


CONCLUSION
MDR-TB is very common among TB patients throughout Belarus.


RELEVANT CHANGES
The estimated HIV transmission rate decreased from 9.6% to 2.8%.
Population-based surveys in 2010 and 2011 reported transmission rates of 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Village doctors prioritize medical services but they do their best to manage their time to include public health services.


METHODS
The study involved a nationwide cohort of 23 813 HIV-positive (HIV+) people injecting opioids who received ART between 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2011.
Mortality rates and demographic, disease and treatment characteristics were compared in patients who received either ART and MMT or ART only.
Factors associated with mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.

FINDINGS
Overall, 3057 deaths occurred during 41 959 person-years of follow-up (mortality: 7.3 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval, CI: 7.0-7.5).
Mortality 6 months after starting ART was significantly lower with ART and MMT than with ART only (6.6 versus 16.9 per 100 person-years, respectively; P < 0.001).
After 12 months, mortality was 3.7 and 7.4 per 100 person-years in the two groups, respectively (P < 0.001).
Not having received MMT was an independent predictor of death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.3-1.6).
Other predictors were a low haemoglobin level and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at ART initiation and treatment at facilities other than infectious disease hospitals.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Training programmes for individual providers and their trainers were redeveloped and expanded in 2008.

LESSONS LEARNT
Key to the programme's success so far have been the strong commitment on the part of China's government and the optimism and pragmatism of programme managers.
Human resources development and capacity-building during scale-up have contributed to improved service quality in MMT treatment clinics and are critical to long-term success.


Title
Methadone maintenance treatment in Spain: the success of a harm reduction approach.

RELEVANT CHANGES
A parallel reduction in the annual incidence of HIV infection has been reported.


METHODS
Rates of paediatric hospitalization for empyema and pneumonia (bacterial, viral and all types) were calculated following the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) as a principal diagnosis.
The expected number of hospitalizations after the PCV7 was introduced was estimated on the basis of the observed number of hospitalizations before the introduction of the PCV7.
Incidence rate differences (IRDs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated.
Hospitalization incidence in each study period was expressed as the number of hospitalizations per million (106) person-years.
The population of children aged 0-19 years in Australia from 1998 to 2004 and from 2005 to 2010, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, was used to calculate the number of person-years in each period.

FINDINGS
In the 5 years following the introduction of the PCV7, hospitalizations for pneumonia were fewer than expected (15 304 fewer; 95% confidence interval, CI: 14 646-15 960; IRD: −552 per 106 person-years; 95% CI: −576 to −529 per 106 person-years; IRR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.77-0.78).
Hospitalizations for empyema, on the other hand, were more than expected (83 more; 95% CI: 37-128; IRD: 3 per 106 person-years; 95% CI: 1-5 per 106 person-years; IRR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.14-1.59).
Reductions in hospitalizations were observed for all ICD-10 pneumonia codes across all age groups.
The increase in empyema hospitalizations was only significant among children aged 1 to 4 years.


METHODS
Data on cases occurring before and during the national outbreak were obtained from the South African measles surveillance programme, and data on measles immunization and population size, from the District Health Information System.
A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model was used to investigate the association between the risk of measles in infants in a district and first-dose vaccination coverage, population density, background prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and expected failure of seroconversion.
Model projections were used to identify emerging high-risk areas in 2012.


FINDINGS
After implementation of the 2010 WHO guidelines, 190 HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis were identified: 53% males; median age, 38 years; median baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4+ cell) count, 43 cells/µL.
Before implementation, 262 patients were identified; 56% males; median age, 36 years; median baseline CD4+ cell count, 59 cells/µL.
With baseline CD4+ cell counts < 50 cells/µL, median delay to ART declined from 5.8 weeks (interquartile range, IQR: 3.7-9.0) before to 3.0 weeks (IQR: 2.1-4.4) after implementation (P < 0.001); with baseline CD4+ cell counts > 50 cells/µL, delay dropped from 7.0 (IQR: 5.3-11.3) to 3.6 (IQR: 2.9-5.3) weeks (P < 0.001).
The probability of ART initiation within 4 and 8 weeks after tuberculosis diagnosis rose from 23% and 65%, respectively, before implementation, to 62% and 90% after implementation.
A non-significant increase in 6-month retention and antiretroviral substitution was seen after implementation.

CONCLUSION
Implementation of 2010 WHO recommendations in a routine clinical setting shortens delay to ART.
Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess impact on patient outcomes.


METHODS
The yearly costs of training, equipping and deploying CHWs throughout rural sub-Saharan Africa were calculated using data from the literature and from the Millennium Villages Project.
Model assumptions were such as to allow national governments to adapt the CHW subsystem to national needs and to deploy an average of 1 CHW per 650 rural inhabitants by 2015.
The CHW subsystem described was costed by employing geographic information system (GIS) data on population, urban extents, national and subnational disease prevalence, and unit costs (from the field for wages and commodities).
The model is easily replicable and configurable.
Countries can adapt it to local prices, wages, population density and disease burdens in different geographic areas.


METHODS
Demographic, socioeconomic and obstetric data for women aged 15 - 49 years were extracted from Viet Nam's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for 2006 (MICS3) and 2010 - 2011 (MICS4).
These independent variables correspond to the analytical framework of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.

FINDINGS
Large discrepancies between urban and rural populations were found in both MICS3 and MICS4.
Although antenatal care attendance and health facility delivery rates improved substantially between surveys (from 86.3 to 92.1% and from 76.2 to 89.7%, respectively), inequities increased, especially along ethnic lines.
The risk of not giving birth in a health facility increased significantly among ethnic minority women living in rural areas.
In 2006 this risk was nearly five times higher than among women of Kinh/Hoa (majority) ethnicity (odds ratio, OR: 4.67; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.94 - 7.43); in 2010 - 2011 it had become nearly 20 times higher (OR: 18.8; 95% CI: 8.96 - 39.2).


FINDINGS
Overall, 98.3% of infants had been breastfed.
However, only 59.4% had initiated breastfeeding early (i.e. within 1 hour of birth); only 55.5% and 9.4% had continued breastfeeding for 1 and 2 years, respectively, and only 28.7% of infants younger than 6 months had been exclusively breastfed.

CONCLUSION
Despite efforts to promote breastfeeding in China, rates are very low.


METHODS
A nationally representative sample of 10 366 children younger than 5 years was obtained from pooled data of cross-sectional surveys conducted in Cambodia in 2000, 2005, and 2010.
The authors used a multivariate hierarchical logistic model to examine the association between the prevalence of childhood stunting over time and certain determinants.
They estimated those changes in the prevalence of stunting in 2010 that could have been achieved through further improvements in public health indicators.

CONCLUSION
Child stunting in Cambodia has decreased owing to socioeconomic development and public health improvements.


METHODS
The mother-infant pairs had been followed up until discharge or for 7 days postpartum.

FINDINGS
These trends were found to be largely unaffected by the continent in which the women lived.


FINDINGS
Entry screening of 116 travellers arriving from Mexico by direct or connecting flights would have been necessary for every one traveller at risk of transporting A(H1N1)pdm09.


METHODS
Data on viral suppression after 12 months of ART in LMICs were collected from articles published in 2003 to 2011 and from abstracts of conferences held between 2009 and 2011.
Pooled proportions for on-treatment and intention-to-treat populations were used as summary estimates.
Random-effects models were used for heterogeneous groups of studies (I2 > 75%).

FINDINGS
Overall, 49 studies covering 48 cohorts and 30 016 individuals met the inclusion criteria.
With thresholds for suppression between 300 and 500 copies of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) per ml of plasma, 84.3% (95% confidence interval, CI: 80.4-87.9) of the pooled on-treatment population and 70.5% (95% CI: 65.2-75.6) of the intention-to-treat population showed suppression.


METHODS
In 2009, the costs to health-care providers of providing comprehensive PMTCT services were assessed in 20 public health facilities in Namibia and Rwanda.
Information on prices and on the total amount of each service provided was collected at the national level.

FINDINGS
The estimated costs to the providers of PMTCT, for each mother-infant pair, were US$ 202.75-1029.55 in Namibia and US$ 94.14-342.35 in Rwanda.
These costs varied with the drug regimen employed.
Adult testing and counselling accounted for the highest proportions of the national costs (37% and 74% in Namibia and Rwanda, respectively), followed by management and supervision.
Treatment and prophylaxis accounted for less than 20% of the costs of PMTCT in both study countries.


FINDINGS
Overall, 2381 records of trials were investigated.
For every million DALYs in high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income and low-income countries, an estimated 292.7, 13.4, 3.0 and 0.8 registered trials, respectively, were recruiting in such countries.


METHODS
From 2004 to 2011, births and neonatal deaths in 36 geographical clusters in Jharkhand and Odisha were monitored.
Between 2005 and 2008, these clusters were part of a randomized controlled trial of how women's group meetings involving participatory learning and action influence maternal and neonatal health.
Between 2008 and 2011, groups in the original intervention clusters (zone 1) continued to meet to discuss post-neonatal issues and new groups in the original control clusters (zone 2) met to discuss neonatal health.
Logistic regression was used to examine neonatal mortality rates after 2008 in the two zones.

FINDINGS
Data on 41 191 births were analysed.
In zone 1, the intervention's effect was sustained: the cluster-mean neonatal mortality rate was 34.2 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval, CI: 28.3-40.0) between 2008 and 2011, compared with 41.3 per 1000 live births (95% CI: 35.4-47.1) between 2005 and 2008.
The effect of the intervention was replicated in zone 2: the cluster-mean neonatal mortality rate decreased from 61.8 to 40.5 per 1000 live births between two periods: 2006-2008 and 2009-2011 (odds ratio: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.57-0.83).
Hygiene during delivery, thermal care of the neonate and exclusive breastfeeding were important factors.


METHODS
A cluster-sampled probability survey of 1593 households in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, was conducted in 2011.
Multilevel logistic regression - with adjustment for any clustering within households - was used to examine the risk of self-reported illness in the previous 30 days.

FINDINGS
According to the interviewees, about 45% of the surveyed individuals had suffered at least one episode of illness in the previous 30 days.
The most frequently reported illnesses among children younger than 5 years and adults were common tropical infections and noncommunicable diseases, respectively.
The risks of self-reported illness in the previous 30 days were relatively high for adults older than 44 years, women and members of households in the poorest quintile.
Distress financing, which had been implemented to cover health-care payments associated with 13% of the reported episodes, was significantly associated with heart and liver disease, asthma, typhoid, inpatient care, the use of public outpatient facilities, and poverty at the household level.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Unlike many other sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana saw a substantial rise in registration rates over the campaign period.
Campaign strategies improved accessibility and shortened distance to registration centres.
Survey data show that the registration rate for children younger than 5 years rose from 44% in 2003 to 71% in 2008.

LESSONS LEARNT
The link between the health sector and registration activities should be strengthened further and the use of community population registers expanded.


METHODS
A convenience sample of 1016 patients receiving HIV treatment in seven clinics was enrolled during 2012.
Contingent valuation was used to assess willingness to pay.
Interviewers reviewed adverse consequences of injection drug use and the benefits of MMT.
Interviewers then described the government's plan to scale up MMT and the financial barriers to scale-up.
Willingness to pay was assessed using double-bounded binary questions and a follow-up open-ended question.
Point and interval data models were used to estimate maximum willingness to pay.

FINDINGS
A total of 548 non-drug-users and 468 injection drug users were enrolled; 988 were willing to pay for MMT.
Fifty per cent of drug users were willing to pay 50% of MMT costs.


METHODS
Data included in the database of the World Health Organization are derived from official country documents and are published annually after review by each country.
In addition to such data, the authors extracted data from publicly available web sites.
The data extracted covered all aid flows from all donors specified for sub-Saharan African countries (including aid for the African region as a whole or for groups of countries in the region) as being for health.

CONCLUSION
Using the wrong source can lead to erroneous conclusions.


METHODS
The authors systematically searched 9 major databases for published and unpublished sources and established direct contact with the authors of source materials.
Searches were country-specific.
To be included, studies had to report on the incidence of CT, on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgM in infants and pregnant women (including seroconversion results) or on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgG in the general population.
Various modelling techniques were used, depending on the country-specific data available, to estimate the CT incidence and burden in each country.
These data were then synthesized into an estimate of the global incidence of CT and of the global burden of CT in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).


METHODS
The results from use of this simple yet powerful method are consistent with those predicted by using previously validated SimSmoke models.

FINDINGS
In total, 41 countries adopted at least one highest-level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2010.
As a result of all policies adopted during this period, the number of smokers is estimated to have dropped by 14.8 million, with a total of 7.4 million SADs averted.


RELEVANT CHANGES
One meal on school days was served to 78% of 5 751 979 primary-school children and to 79% of 2 704 692 secondary-school children (April 2011 to March 2012).
Most of the kitchens visited in 2010 (79%) and 2011 (83%) were consistently using adequately iodized salt to prepare hot meals.


Findings
The pollutants identified were microbial organisms, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc.
All were detected in the catchments but only cadmium, cobalt, chromium, manganese and lead exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values after water treatment.
Post-treatment contamination was observed.
The estimated disease burden was greatest for chromium in both schemes, followed in decreasing order by cadmium, lead, manganese and cobalt.
For each metal, the disease burden exceeded the reference level and was comparable with that due to microbial contamination reported elsewhere in Africa.


Findings
Overall, 9624 records of adverse events attributed to traditional medical practices - including 522 linked to herbal treatments - were identified.
Liver problems were the most frequently reported adverse events.
Only eight of the adverse events were recorded by the pharmacovigilance system run by the Food and Drug Administration.
Of the 9624 events, 1389 - mostly infections, cases of pneumothorax and burns - were linked to physical therapy (n = 285) or acupuncture/moxibustion (n = 1104).

Conclusion
The Consumer Agency and the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine should be included in the national pharmacovigilance system.


Findings
During the hot season, admissions increased by 4.5% for every increase of 1 °C above 29 °C; during the cold season, admissions increased by 1.4% for every decrease of 1 °C within the 8.2–26.9 °C range.
In subgroup analyses, admissions for respiratory and infectious diseases increased during extreme heat and cold, but cardiovascular disease admissions increased only during cold temperatures.
For every increase of 1 °C above 29 °C, admissions for unintentional injuries increased by 1.9%.
During the cold season, for every decrease of 1 °C within the 8.2–26.9 °C range, admissions for cardiovascular diseases and intentional injuries rose by 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively.
Admission patterns were not sensitive to sex.
Admissions for respiratory diseases rose during hot and cold temperatures among children but only during cold temperatures among the elderly.
In people aged 75 years or older, admissions for infectious diseases rose during both temperature extremes.

Conclusion
In Hong Kong SAR, hospitalizations rise during extreme temperatures.


Approach
Haiti's health ministry and the United Nations Children's Fund, in collaboration with local and international nongovernmental organizations, established baby tents in the areas affected by the earthquake.
Such a large and coordinated baby tent response in an emergency context had never been mounted before anywhere in the world.

Relevant changes
Between February 2010 and June 2012, 193 baby tents were set up; 180&#x2009;499 mother&#x2013;infant pairs and 52&#x2009;503 pregnant women were registered in the baby tent programme.
In 2010, 13.5% of registered infants could not be breastfed.


Methods
Information from the PAHO Country Capacity Survey on noncommunicable diseases was also analysed.

Findings
The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay showed relatively high rates of death from breast cancer, whereas the three highest rates of death from cervical cancer were observed in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Paraguay.
Several countries – particularly Paraguay and Venezuela – have high rates of death from both types of cancer.
Although mortality from cervical cancer has generally been decreasing in the Americas, decreases in mortality from breast cancer have only been observed in a few countries in the Region of the Americas.
All but one of the 25 countries in the Americas included in the PAHO Country Capacity Survey reported having public health services for the screening and treatment of breast and cervical cancers.


Methods
A random-effects model was then used to calculate and compare the odds of men and women having each condition.


Relevant changes
PRRR has introduced a diagonal strategy based on the life course and continuum of care approaches to cancer control.


Methods
In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, two strategies for neonatal care – known as home care and community care – were compared with existing services.
For each study arm, economic costs were estimated from a societal perspective, inclusive of programme costs, provider costs and household out-of-pocket payments on care-seeking.
Neonatal mortality in each study arm was determined through household surveys.
The incremental cost-effectiveness of each strategy – compared with that of the pre-existing levels of maternal and neonatal care – was then estimated.
The levels of uncertainty in our estimates were quantified through probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

Findings
The corresponding total societal costs were US$ 2971 (95% CI: 1844–7628) and US$ 104.62 (95% CI: 65.15–266.60), respectively.
In contrast, implementation of the community-care strategy led to no reduction in neonatal mortality and did not appear to be cost-effective.


Objective
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of hospital payment systems based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) in low- and middle-income countries.

Findings
Twelve low- and middle-income countries have DRG-based payment systems and another 17 are in the piloting or exploratory stage.
Countries have chosen from a wide range of imported and self-developed DRG models and most have adapted such models to their specific contexts.
All countries have set expenditure ceilings.
In general, systems were piloted before being implemented.
The need to meet certain requirements in terms of coding standardization, data availability and information technology made implementation difficult.
Private sector providers have not been fully integrated, but most countries have managed to delink hospital financing from public finance budgeting.


Methods
A case–control study was conducted with surveillance data from Matlab, a rural subdistrict.
Cases (n = 2213) and controls (n = 261) were men aged 25 to 69 years who had died between 2003 and 2010 from smoking-related and non-smoking-related causes, respectively.
Cause-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for “ever-smokers” versus “never-smokers”, with adjustment for education, tobacco chewing status and age.
Smoking-attributable deaths among cases, national attributable fractions and cumulative probability of surviving from 25 to 69 years of age among ever-smokers and never-smokers were also calculated.

Findings
The fraction of ever-smokers was about 84% among cases and 73% among controls (OR: 1.7; 99% confidence interval, CI: 1.1–2.5).
ORs were highest for cancers and lower for respiratory, vascular and other diseases.
A dose–response relationship was noted between age at smoking initiation and daily number of cigarettes or bidis smoked and the risk of death.
Among 25-year-old Bangladeshi men, 32% of ever-smokers will die before reaching 70 years of age, compared with 19% of never-smokers.
In 2010, about 25% of all deaths observed in Bangladeshi men aged 25 to 69 years (i.e. 42 000 deaths) were attributable to smoking.


Methods
A community survey was conducted among 190 people injured by landmines or UXO and 380 age-, sex- and neighbourhood-matched non-injured individuals in the Sepone district of Savannakhet Province, the part of the Lao People's Democratic Republic most heavily bombed during the Viet Nam War.
Using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, trained health-care workers conducted face-to-face interviews to assess PTSD symptoms and level of perceived social support.
Multiple linear regression was performed to explore the association between social support and other factors and PTSD.

Findings
The prevalence of PTSD was higher among the injured (10%) than among the non-injured (4%), but the level of perceived social support was not significantly different between the two groups.
A higher level of perceived social support was associated with milder symptoms of PTSD.
Women, older people and those with a formal education were more often and more severely affected by PTSD.


Methods
Five electronic databases were searched for relevant abstracts and to identify papers eligible for full-text review.
References of papers included in our study were searched to identify additional candidate publications.
Disagreements about inclusion were adjudicated during discussions involving all authors.
Data were extracted independently by two authors, using a form developed by the authors and tested on a sample of papers.

Findings
A total of 2320 unique papers was found; the full text of 87 was reviewed.
Nineteen papers featuring 11 cross-sectional studies were included; all were published during 1995–2011.
Studies occurred in Benin, Botswana, the Central African Republic, the Congo and Nigeria and enrolled approximately 10 500 participants.
The prevalence of dementia ranged from 0%, in Nigeria, to 10.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 8.6–11.8), also in Nigeria.
The prevalence of cognitive impairment ranged from 6.3%, in Nigeria, to 25% (95% CI: 21.2–29.0), in the Central African Republic.


Relevant changes
The summary findings were reported daily to clinics.
The team also collaborated with public health nurses in rebuilding communication networks.
Public health nurses alerted evacuation centres to epidemics of communicable disease.

Lessons learnt
Modern health-care systems are highly vulnerable to the loss of advanced technological tools.
The initiation – or re-establishment – of disease surveillance following a natural disaster can therefore prove challenging even in a developed country.


Methods
Data on government and total expenditure on health worker remuneration were obtained through a review of official documents in WHO's Global Health Expenditure Database and directly from country officials and country official web sites.
Such data are presented in this paper, by World Bank country income groups, in millions of national currency units per calendar year for salaried and non-salaried health workers.
They are presented as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), total health expenditure and general government health expenditure.
The average yearly change in remuneration (i.e. compound annual growth rate) between 2000 and 2012 as a function of these parameters was also assessed.

Findings
On average, payments to health workers of all types accounted for more than one third of total health expenditure across countries.
Remuneration of health workers, on the other hand, has grown faster than that of other types of workers.


Findings
A national authority was designated by 85 countries.
Only 56 countries reported on the status of Code implementation.
Of these, 37 had taken steps towards implementing the Code, primarily by engaging relevant stakeholders.
In 90% of countries, migrant health professionals reportedly enjoy the same legal rights and responsibilities as domestically trained health personnel.
In the context of the Code, cooperation in the area of health workforce development goes beyond migration-related issues.
An international comparative information base on health workforce mobility is needed but can only be developed through a collaborative, multi-partnered approach.

Conclusion
Reporting on the implementation of the Code has been suboptimal in all but one WHO region.


Findings
Fifty-three studies, mostly from high-income countries and conducted at tertiary care facilities, were identified.
In general, there was no difference between the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers in the areas of maternal and child health and communicable and noncommunicable diseases and that provided by higher level health workers.
However, the rates of episiotomy and analgesia use were significantly lower in women giving birth who received care from midwives alone than in those who received care from doctors working in teams with midwives, and women were significantly more satisfied with care from midwives.
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.
The search also identified six observational studies, all from Africa, that compared care from clinical officers, surgical technicians or non-physician clinicians with care from doctors.

Conclusion
No difference between the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers and that provided by higher level health workers was found.
However, the quality of the evidence was low.


Local setting
It also lacked an accreditation system for use in the training of health workers.

Lessons learnt
A national process of coordination and facilitation can produce a consensus-based view of the main HRH challenges.
Once these challenges have been identified, the stakeholders can plan appropriate interventions that are coordinated, evidence-based and coherent.


Local setting
The national government of the Sudan sanctioned state-level governance of the health system but many states lacked coherent HRH plans and policies.
A paucity of training institutions constrained HRH production and the adequate and equitable deployment of health workers in rural areas.

Lessons learnt
The support led to political commitment and the mobilization of resources for HRH.
The leadership that was promoted and the educational institutions that were opened should facilitate the training, deployment and retention of the health workers needed to achieve universal health coverage.


Methods
Cross-sectional data were extracted from the results of 80 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 26 countries in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.
Caesarean delivery rates were evaluated – as percentages of the deliveries that ended in live births – for each wealth quintile in each survey.
The annual rates recorded for each country were then compared to see if they had increased over time.

Findings
Among the poorest 20% of the population, caesarean sections accounted for less than 1% and less than 2% of deliveries in 12 and 21 of the study countries, respectively.
In each of 11 countries, the caesarean delivery rate in the poorest 40% of the population remained under 1%.
In Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria, the rate remained under 1% in the poorest 80%.
Compared with the 22 African study countries, the four study countries in southern Asia experienced a much greater rise in their caesarean delivery rates over time.
However, the rates recorded among the poorest quintile in each of these countries consistently fell below 2%.


Methods
The respondents' assessments of the briefs and dialogues and the respondents' intentions to act on what they had learned were then investigated in descriptive statistical analyses and regression models.

Findings
Of the 530 individuals who read the evidence briefs and attended dialogues, 304 (57%) and 303 (57%) completed questionnaires about the briefs and dialogues, respectively.
Respondents viewed the evidence briefs and deliberative dialogues – as well as each of their key features – very favourably, regardless of the country, issue or group involved.
Overall, “not concluding with recommendations” and “not aiming for a consensus” were identified as the least helpful features of the briefs and dialogues, respectively.
Respondents generally reported strong intentions to act on what they had learnt.


Findings
Strong positive correlations were detected between the interval from surgery to discharge and general government expenditure on health.

Conclusion
The time intervals for the treatment of femur fractures are relatively long in low- and middle-income countries, can easily be measured, and are highly correlated with accessible and quantifiable country data on health and economics.


Methods
The intervention took place in six rural districts selected by the Zambian Ministry of Health.
It involved community discussions on safe pregnancy and delivery led by trained volunteers and the provision of emergency transport.
Volunteers worked through existing government-established Safe Motherhood Action Groups.
Maternal health indicators at baseline were obtained from women in intervention (n = 1775) and control districts (n = 1630).
The intervention's effect on these indicators was assessed using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach that involved propensity score matching and adjustment for confounders such as education, wealth, parity, age and distance to a health-care facility.

Findings
The volunteer drop-out rate was low.
The estimated incremental cost per additional delivery involving a skilled birth attendant was around 54 United States dollars, comparable to that of other demand-side interventions in developing countries.


Methods
During a 10-day mass vaccination campaign against meningitis A in three regions of Chad in 2011, the costs associated with storage and transport of the vaccine in a traditional cold chain system were evaluated.


Methods
In a global survey, experts on contraception were invited to identify and rank the types of research that would be needed – and the knowledge gaps that would have to be filled – to reduce the unmet need for family planning in the next decade.
The overall scores were then ranked.

Conclusion
Experts on contraception gave top priority ranking to research on improving the implementation and integration of health services and on strengthening the health systems supporting family planning services.


Methods
Data on children younger than 5 years who were hospitalized for diarrhoea in health ministry hospitals between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2011 were collected from monthly discharge reports.
Annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea – per 10 000 hospitalizations for any cause – were calculated.
Administrative data were used to estimate vaccine coverage.

Findings
In the states with high, intermediate and low socioeconomic status, coverage with a two-dose monovalent RVA vaccine – among children younger than 5 years – had reached 93%, 86% and 71%, respectively, by 2010.
The corresponding median annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea – per 10 000 admissions – fell from 1001, 834 and 1033 in the “prevaccine” period of 2003–2006, to 597, 497 and 705 in the “postvaccine” period from 2008 to 2011, respectively.
These decreases correspond to rate reductions of 40% (95% confidence interval, CI: 38–43), 41% (95% CI: 38–43) and 32% (95% CI: 29–34), respectively.
Nationwide, RVA vaccination appeared to have averted approximately 16 500 hospitalizations for childhood diarrhoea in each year of the postvaccine period.


Methods
R was estimated for 2009–2011 by means of three methods, using data from Australia's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System.
Method 1 estimated R as 1 − P, where P equals the proportion of cases that were imported, as determined from data on place of acquisition.
The other methods estimated R by fitting a subcritical branching process that modelled the spread of an infection with a given R to the observed distributions of outbreak sizes (method 2) and generations of spread (method 3).
Stata version 12 was used for method 2 and Matlab version R2012 was used for method 3.
For all methods, calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was performed using a normal approximation based on estimated standard errors.

Findings
During 2009–2011, 367 notifiable measles cases occurred in Australia (mean annual rate: 5.5 cases per million population).
Data were 100% complete for importation status but 77% complete for outbreak reference number.
R was estimated as < 1 for all years and data types, with values of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60–0.70) obtained by method 1, 0.64 (95% CI: 0.56–0.72) by method 2 and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.38–0.57) by method 3.


Methods
The cumulative case ratio for malaria-related visits to these facilities was determined using data from the Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project.
Catchment areas were also derived using various straight line and road network distances from the facility.
Subsequently, the 1-year cumulative malaria case rate was calculated for each catchment area, as determined using the three methods.

Findings
The 1-year cumulative malaria case rate varied considerably with the method used to define the catchment areas.
With the cumulative case ratio approach, the catchment area could include noncontiguous areas.
With the distance approaches, the denominator increased substantially with distance, whereas the numerator increased only slightly.


Methods
Data from a cervical cancer screening programme embedded in two HIV clinic sites in western Kenya were evaluated.
Women at a central site underwent VIA, while women at a peripheral site underwent VIA/VILI.
All women positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) on VIA and/or VILI had a confirmatory colposcopy, with a biopsy if necessary.
Overall test positivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and the CIN 2+ detection rate were calculated for the two screening methods, with biopsy being the gold standard.

Findings
Between October 2007 and October 2010, 2338 women were screened with VIA and 1124 with VIA/VILI.
Histologically confirmed CIN 2+ was detected in 8.9% and 7.8% (P = 0.27) of women in the VIA and VIA/VILI groups, respectively.
The PPV of VIA for biopsy-confirmed CIN 2+ in a single round of screening was 35.2%, compared with 38.2% for VIA/VILI (P = 0.41).


Methods
Risk factors for diabetes and prediabetes were identified using multilevel logistic regression models, with adjustment for clustering within households and communities.

Findings
The overall age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was 9.7% and 22.4%, respectively.
In addition, the likelihood of diabetes was also significantly associated with educational level, body weight and the presence of hypertension.
The prevalence of diabetes varied significantly with region of residence.


Approach
During each of seven supplementary immunization activities against polio in Karachi, mobile phone numbers of the caregivers of a random sample of eligible children were obtained.
Persistent non-responders were phoned directly by an investigator.

Lessons learnt
For the monitoring of coverage in supplementary immunization activities, automated SMS-based systems appear to be an attractive and relatively inexpensive option.
Further research is needed to determine if coverage data collected by SMS-based systems provide estimates that are sufficiently accurate.
Such systems may be useful in other large-scale immunization campaigns.


Methods
In Soweto, South Africa, mother–infant pairs who were uninfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were enrolled as they presented for the “6-week” immunizations of the infants.
Each infant was randomly assigned to Group 1 – in which breastfeeding was deferred for at least 1 h before and after each dose of rotavirus vaccine – or Group 2 – in which unrestricted breastfeeding was encouraged.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to evaluate the titres of rotavirus-specific IgA in samples of serum collected from each infant immediately before each vaccine dose and 1 month after the second dose.
Among the infants, a fourfold or greater increase in titres of rotavirus-specific IgA following vaccination was considered indicative of seroconversion.


Methods
A search was conducted of the published literature reporting total mercury (Hg) in hair and blood in women and infants.
These biomarkers are validated proxy measures of MeHg, a neurotoxin found primarily in seafood.
Average and high-end biomarkers were extracted, stratified by seafood consumption context, and pooled by category.

Findings
Selection criteria were met by 164 studies of women and infants from 43 countries.
Pooled average biomarkers suggest an intake of MeHg several times over the FAO/WHO reference in fish-consuming riparians living near small-scale gold mining and well over the reference in consumers of marine mammals in Arctic regions.
In coastal regions of south-eastern Asia, the western Pacific and the Mediterranean, average biomarkers approach the reference.
Although the two former groups have a higher risk of neurotoxicity than the latter, coastal regions are home to the largest number at risk.
High-end biomarkers across all categories indicate MeHg intake is in excess of the reference value.


Approach
In 2013, the return on these investments was evaluated by investigating China’s early response to the emergence of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in humans.

Relevant changes
On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus.
Poultry markets – which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans – were closed down in the affected areas.
Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated.
The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication.
New cases were reported promptly and publicly.


Methods
Weekly influenza surveillance data for 2006 to 2011 were obtained from Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Monthly positivity rates were then calculated to define annual peaks of influenza activity in each country and across countries.

Findings
Influenza activity peaked between June/July and October in seven countries, three of which showed a second peak in December to February.
Countries closer to the equator had year-round circulation without discrete peaks.
Viral types and subtypes varied from year to year but not across countries in a given year.
The cumulative proportion of specimens that tested positive from June to November was > 60% in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Thus, these tropical and subtropical countries exhibited earlier influenza activity peaks than temperate climate countries north of the equator.


Conclusion
Routine immunization must be strengthened and the remaining immunity gaps need to be identified and filled.


Methods
A cross-sectional survey of bereaved mothers was conducted 30 to 34 months after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake using individual structured interviews to assess sociodemographic characteristics, post-disaster experiences and mental health.
The interviews incorporated standardized psychometric measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief (CG).
Social support was also assessed.
An adjusted model taking potential confounders into account was used to explore any association between psychological symptoms and the birth of a subsequent child.

Conclusion
Research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions designed to provide women with psychosocial support and reproductive services.


Findings
Overall, 258 RCTs were found on American trypanosomiasis, Buruli ulcer, dengue, geohelminth infection, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, rabies, schistosomiasis or trachoma.
No RCTs were found on cysticercosis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, foodborne trematodes, or human African trypanosomiasis.
The most studied diseases were geohelminth infection (51 RCTs) and leishmaniasis (46 RCTs).
Vaccines, chemoprophylaxis and interventions targeting insect vectors were evaluated in 113, 99 and 39 RCTs, respectively.
Few addressed how best to deliver preventive chemotherapy, such as the choice of dosing interval (10) or target population (4), the population coverage needed to reduce transmission (2) or the method of drug distribution (1).
Thirty-one publications containing 32 systematic reviews (16 with and 16 without meta-analyses) were found on American trypanosomiasis, dengue, geohelminths, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis or trachoma.
Together, they included only 79 of the 258 published RCTs (30.6%).
Of 36 interventions assessed, 8 were judged effective in more than one review.


Relevant changes
The B Positive programme has been informed by economic modelling.

Lessons learnt
The identification and accurate staging of cases and the judicious use of antiviral medications are predicated upon an informed and educated health workforce.


Methods
Reductions in age- and sex-specific mortality seen in each BRICS country between 1990 and 2011 were measured.
These results were compared with those of the best-performing countries in the world and the best-performing countries with similar income levels.

Findings
The relative health performance of the five study countries differed markedly over the study period.
Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed.
India’s improvement was more modest and more varied across the subgroups.
South Africa and the Russian Federation exhibited large declines in health performance as well as large sex-specific inequalities in health.
Although China’s levels of avoidable mortality decreased in absolute terms, the level of improvement appeared low in the context of China’s economic growth.


Findings
Four of the BRICS countries showed increases in both income level and income inequality between 1990 and 2010.
The exception was Brazil, where income inequality decreased over the same period.
Between-country inequalities in level of education and access to sanitation remained mostly unchanged but the largest between-country difference in mean life expectancy increased, from 9 years in 1990 to 20 years in 2010.
Throughout the study period, there was disproportionality in the burden of disease between BRICS.
However, the national infant mortality rate fell substantially over the study period in all five countries.
In Brazil and China, the magnitude of subnational income-related inequalities in infant mortality, both absolute and relative, also decreased substantially.


Methods
A cluster-randomized controlled trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Register: ChiCTR-TRC-09000488) was conducted in 100 township health centres in north-western China between 17 October and 25 December 2011.
Health workers’ knowledge of the recommendations was assessed before and after messaging and traditional training through a multiple choice questionnaire.
The percentage change in score in the control group was compared with that in the intervention group.
Changes in prescribing practices were also compared.

Findings
In the intervention group steroid prescriptions decreased by 5 percentage points but antibiotic prescriptions remained unchanged.
In the control group, however, antibiotic and steroid prescriptions increased by 17 and 11 percentage points, respectively.


Methods
Interviews were conducted with nine national experts from the pharmacy sector.

Findings
Community pharmacies increased in number by 13% between 1994 and 2012 – less than the 25% population growth.
In 2012, community pharmacy density was higher in urban provinces and was eight times higher in the least deprived districts than in the most deprived ones.
Maldistribution persisted despite the growth of corporate community pharmacies.
In 2012, only two provinces met the 1 per 10 000 benchmark, although all provinces achieved it when community pharmacies and clinics were combined.
Experts expressed concerns that a lack of rural incentives, inappropriate licensing criteria and a shortage of pharmacy workers could undermine access to pharmaceutical services, especially in rural areas.


Methods
This study involved villages that participated in a cluster randomized trial comparing the effect of one versus three azithromycin MDA rounds on the prevalence of trachoma.
Only villages in which most children received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were included.
The third survey also covered six villages that had received one MDA round 30 months previously.
Pneumococcal carriage was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs and azithromycin resistance was detected using the Etest.


Title
A systematic review of the evidence from low- and middle-income countries.

Findings
Of the 82 empirical costing and efficiency studies identified, nine provided data on economies of scale.
Scale explained much of the variation in the costs of several HIV services, particularly those of targeted HIV prevention for key populations and HIV testing and treatment.
There is some evidence of economies of scope from integrating HIV counselling and testing services with several other services.
Cost efficiency may also be improved by reducing input prices, task shifting and improving client adherence.


Methods
Combination antiretroviral regimens were offered to pregnant and breastfeeding, HIV-infected women, irrespective of immunological status, at four rural health facilities.
Twenty-four-month HIV-free survival among children born to HIV-infected mothers was determined before and after PMTCT programme implementation using community surveys.
Households were randomly selected and women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were asked to participate.
Mothers were tested for HIV antibodies and children born to HIV-infected mothers were tested for viral deoxyribonucleic acid.
Multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with child HIV infection or death.

Findings
In the first survey (2008–2009), 335 of 1778 women (18.8%) tested positive for HIV.
In the second (2011), 390 of 2386 (16.3%) tested positive.
The 24-month HIV-free survival in HIV-exposed children was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.63–0.76) in the first survey and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83–0.94) in the second.
Combination antiretroviral regimen use was associated with a lower risk of HIV infection or death in children (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15–0.73).
Maternal knowledge of HIV status, use of HIV tests and use of combination regimens during pregnancy increased between the surveys.

The average follow-up time was 6 months.


METHODS
A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on asymptomatic 300 non-athlete persons and 100 Cuban Olympic athletes.
A novel methodology of sonographic scanning for the knee was used including static and dynamic studies, according to the sportive specialty, to determine the normal patterns, to detect alterations in joint structures as well as to estimate the sonographic RAB (stands for Ricardo Anillo´s acronym, main author).
An alternative to determine the misalignment of the extensor mechanism was created.
The statistical processing used summary measures to compare sonographic alteration ratios observed in the knees and also Chi square test.
Percentiles were calculated using data from 600 knees from non-athlete people and all this information was processed through the SPSS statistical program.


INTRODUCTION
The aim of present paper is to describe the injuries present in articular and periarticular structures of feet and ankles of tae know doe athletes.

METHODS
A cross-sectional and descriptive study was conducted in 100 non-sportsman young peoples (control) and in the 20 members of tae knon do male Cuban short list.
They underwent diagnostic echographic exploration of feet and ankles according to methodology of imaging laboratory from Sports Medicine Institute.
Data were processed by descriptive statistic.


RESULTS
From 15 non-ambulatory patients 9 recovered that function (60%).
There was not relation between the lesion time and neurologic recovery.
The more frequent complication was the infection with deceased patient.
Mean time of lesion duration was of 11,7 months, and the mean time of postoperative course was of 10,7months.


RESULTS
Mean age at transposition was of 5,8 years (5-8 years).
Axillary approach in 11 cases and posterior brachial in 15 were used.
In 11 patients it was necessary a previous or simultaneous release surgery.
Active mobility in external rotation was of 7º (0º - 20º) and increased to 61º (35º -90º).
Active mobility in internal mobility was of 83º (75º - 90º) and decreased to 57º (25º - 70º).
Functional assessment according to the modified Mallet's score on average was of 13 points (8-17) and improved to 20 points (16-23).
There were not complications with applied treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
Above mentioned transposition leads to an increase in active mobility of abduction and external rotation of shoulder.
Treatment achieved an improvement of general member function in all patients.


INTRODUCTION
Equinovarus foot is one of the more frequent podalic affections at birth.
The aim of present paper was to assess the use of RALCA® external fixation in irreducible congenital equinovarus foot.

METHODS
An interventional study was conducted in 15 patients (21 feet) aged 4 and 10, seen in "Frank País" International Orthopedic Scientific Complex from January 1, 2007 to December, 31 2008 presenting with irreducible equinovarus foot.
All patients received the above mentioned fixation.
Authors applied the score for Dimeglio/Bensahel `clinical correction and the Roye score for function-satisfaction.
Six radiographic parameters were measured before and after therapeutical procedure.


METHODS
An interventional prospective study was conducted in 15 patients presenting with unstable vertebral factures from 1990 to 2001.
All patients underwent a lateral and preoperative and postoperative routine radiological study.
According the Frankel's classification the preoperative and postoperative clinical picture was registered.

RESULTS
There was a male sex predominance (86.6%) and mean age was of 35,2 years.
Ten patients were operated on; in all there was instrumentation and in five we used decompression of nervous elements, as well as the Luque instrumentation, transpedicular corpectomy and Luque instrumentation, Harrington-Luque and anterior decompression with AO osteosynthesis.
As complication were registered the dura mater and sepsis in the operative site in a case and a rupture in one of the Luque wires in other patient.


RESULTS
Average time for flap placement after lesion was of 12 days.


INTRODUCTION
Present paper is an initial report on application of such technique in Cuba.

RESULTS
There was a isolated stenosis of vertebral channel in 4 patients (40%), isolated disk hernia in 3 patients (30%) and a combination of both processes in the same lumbar segment in 2 cases (20%).


METHODS
Sample included 38 patients.

RESULTS
The more frequent locations were the forearm bones, specially the cubitus (26 patients).
It is important to emphasize that in 5 patients the pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed in both bones of forearms.
Only 5 patients evolved in a torpid way and around the 87% of patients evolved in a satisfactory way.


INTRODUCTION
The flat valgus foot is one of the more frequent orthopedic affections in children.

RESULTS
The 12 patients operated on were aged between 6 and 12.


METHODS
Treatment included external fixation using the Gabriel Ilizarov's external fixation (circular model) and the external fixation type RALCA® designed by the professor Rodrigo Alvarez Cambras (biplane model).
Ten pseudoarthrosis of tibia and one of femur were treated.


METHODS
As information source the medical records of such patients were used.

RESULTS
The asymmetry of thigh cutaneous folds and of the buttocks hadn't a positive diagnostic value for HDD.


METHODS
A longitudinal and prospective study was conducted in 10 patients presenting with hands's lesions caused by firearms seen in the Sana's General Military Hospital (Yemen) from January to October, 2009.
All patients had fractures in some of the hand's bones: metacarpal(8) and phalanx (2).
Nervous lesions (7) were located in the motor branch of median nerve (2) and in the finger's sensitive branches (5).
Nine of the 10 patients had tendinous lesions in the extensor and flexor ones (5) and in the extensors only (4).


RESULTS
Sports accidents were the more frequent cause (10 patients, 55,6%).
According to Bunnel classification, 10 patients had II degree lesions (55,6%) and 8 had III degree lesions (44,4%).


RESULTS
There was prevalence of male sex aged between 13-15.
The flat foot and equinovarus foot are the more frequent podalic deformities where a triple arthrodesis was carried out.
The podoscopy, radiographic studies and application an analogous visual scale are important to assess efficaciously the results from triple arthrodesis.
With the use of staples a high rate of consolidation of treated deformities was achieved.
The incidence of complications was low and more frequent found was the hematoma of surgical wound.
Most of patients (85,7%) had good results.

Title
Hip fracture and the multiple myeloma


Methods
a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive and observational study was conducted in 68 cases admitted due to hip fracture from January to June, 2010, operated on or not residents of this municipality.
All were collected in the study period and were registered in a data form created to that end, in addition to the anesthetic checkup sheets, the geriatric assessment and the clinical records.


Results
In both types of fractures the operating time was between 1 and 2 h (95 %), mean 1.27 min, the complications were similar but with predominance of medical complications in the intracapsular ones (76 %) and the surgical ones in the extracapsular type (40 %).
The acute inflammatory pneumonia was the more frequent medical complication in both groups.
Into the surgical ones, the cellulitis was the more represented.
The preoperative, the postoperative as a total were similar in both groups.
In the treatment the #130 layer and the screw (36 %) predominated in the extracapsular ones and the partial prosthesis in the intracapsular ones (39 %).
As regards the discharge status was the same in both groups, 97 % of lives and the 3 % of deceased.


Methods
a prospective study was conducted in168 patients diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.

Results
the postoperative assessment at 7 days in operated on using one incision was of 0 in 57 of 90, with two incisions was of 0 in 40 of 78.


Introduction
the vertebral osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis is an uncommon disease.
Its incidence has increased in past years due to a significant quantity of spinal surgical procedures, to nosocomial bacteremia, aging of population and the addiction to intravenous drugs.
The hematogenic infection is the commonest cause of spondylitis.


Introduction
the sarcomas are soft tissue malignant tumors accounting for the 0.7 % of malignant tumors in general with a rate of 3 by 100 000.
The malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a high grade tumor included in the group of soft tissue tumors.

Conclusions
the anatomic and pathologic diagnosis was a malignant fibrous histiocytoma pleomorphous type; the patient was referred to Oncology service where was treated with radiotherapy.
At 6 months he was free of disease.


Results
Complications included graft luxation with a deep sepsis, as well as two dural sac tears.


Results
after surgery pain disappeared and the neurologic function became normal.
During a 3-month follow-up patient had not relapse.


Introduction
In these cases the osteosynthesis is affected by the mechanical factors inherent to procedure and to implants.


Methods
a prospective longitudinal descriptive study was conducted of 38 patients receiving bone grafts of the medial acetabular wall combined with total hip arthroplasty with a cementless acetabular component from January 2008 to December 2010.
Autologous grafts were used in 23 patients and homologous bank bone grafts in 15.
The patients were followed up through physical and radiographic examination conducted 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.

Results
all graft types seemed to incorporate within a period of approximately 3 months.
No patient showed protrusion progression during the stage of graft consolidation or later.

The sample was composed of 84 patients (91 knees) that fulfilled the assumed criteria.


Methods
from January 2009 to June 2010, 11 horizontalization osteotomies of the radial glenoid were performed in 7 manual workers and 4 intellectual ones, male, with an average age of 36 years (between 24 and 49 years) and an average latency time of 6 years (between 1 and 14 years).
The technique consisted on the resection of the cuneiform bone 2 cm proximal to the terminal portion of the styloid apophysis, with a lateral base of 0.5-1 cm and centred in the distal radioulnar joint without modification of the length of the radius.

Results
All patients could return to work.


Methods
The surgical techniques applied were simple release, recalibration and laminectomy, instrumentation and fusion.


Methods
prospective cross-sectional study.
The sample consisted of 53 patients meeting the inclusion criteria.

Results
In 64 % of these patients surgical time ranged between one and two hours.
Only five patients (9 %) had complications: two wound hematomas, two loss of fixation and one migration of femoral neck screws.


Methods
the patients who presented with more than three hemarthoses in a month were included in the study.
After the patients' consent, they were injected 1 mCi of the radionuclide in the affected joint.
The migration of the radiopharmaceutical was then monitored 10 minutes after the procedure as well as 1, 7 and 30 days following the treatment.
Hematological and cytogenetic studies were also performed before and one year after the treatment.
The bleeding frequency rate, pain and the consumption of anti-hemophilic factor were determined.
Ten knees from 9 patients received this therapy (hemophilia A in 88.9 % and hemophilia B in 11.1 %).
The average age of patients was 36.3 years, with a range of 23 to 59 years.


Conclusions
A slight variation of the bone stress was noticed after placing the implant.
When both implants were removed, there was a rise of compressive stresses at the borders of the holes they fixed.


Introduction
degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis is a serious health problem in the older adults at present.


Results
males (66.6 %), 4-9 years-olds (55.6 %), Caucasians (100 %) and both limbs affected (100 %) prevailed.
All the patients presented functional compromise, degree III or IV in the plantigram and radiographic indicators for severity.
Minor complications were observed in a small portion of patients (n= 3 for 33.4 %).
The level of satisfaction of the parents was high and the surgical result of this procedure was very good.


Introduction
fractal geometry allows the objective measurement of irregular structures such as those of the human body.


Methods
a prospective, longitudinal and intervention study was conducted in high performance athletes operated on for valgus extension overload syndrome.

Results
The most observed complication was pain relapse due to medial collateral ligament insufficiency in one patient.
The functional results according to Conway's scale were excellent in 5 patients, good in two and unsatisfactory in just one patient.


METHODS
This was a qualitative arm of a larger study, titled 'Are inpatients aware of the admission reasons and management plans of their clinical conditions?
A survey at a tertiary hospital in South Africa', conducted in 2010.
Data were analysed thematically.

RESULTS
Some inpatients had unquestioning trust in healthcare practitioners, whilst others had experiences of bad treatment.
Some inpatients stated that they had no reason for not seeking clarity.
