Abstract
Furthermore, as the treatments of this type of pathologies is complex and involves different kinds of medication, it may lead to interaction problems with odontologist prescriptions.


Title
What can clinical examination of the tongue reveal?

Abstract
There are various lingual lesions.
They may be isolated, but most often they are in the line with a pathological context of oral mucosa or a general pathology.
The diagnosis of glossodynia (burning mouth syndrom) is a diagnosis of exclusion in the presence of characteristic pain symptoms and an examination of the tongue, which is often normal.


Abstract
The unitary toothless situations represent one of the clinical situations witch offer the most large therapeutical eventails.
n effect, however the concerned sector, the treatment hypotheses are Nemours :implanto-hold prosthesis, celled bridge, conventional bridge, movable prosthesis, and also orthodontical treatment.
In the limits of their indication’s field, the celled bridge constitutes a choice alternative answering to functional, esthetical and biological imperatives.
Essentially, they address for cases of unitary toothless; borded by the normoposition’s teeth, nearly healthy and reduced mobility.
Their indication’s rigor constitutes an important element in their successfulness.

It was with the Val-de-Grâce the first maxillofacial rehabilitation centre.
The Functional Unit of Odontology and Maxillofacial prosthesis provides support to patients of the hospital group, the corresponding hospitals, thus a collaboration with city practitioners.
Its activity covers oral dermatology, oral surgery, sleep apnea, implantology and more specifically maxillofacial prosthesis.


Title
Specificity of hospital dentistry in prison

Abstract
The dental treatments in prison are made by the closest hospital center.
After a dental balance sheet at the entrance, the prisoner can ask at any time to be looked after.
If the care in prison stay the same that those practised outside, it exists however a lot of specificities in prison environment.
The necessity of dental treatment is deteriorate by the beggary, the precariousness or drug addiction.
Sometimes acts of violence between prisoners generate wounds or fractures.
The ageing of the prison population also goes with its associated pathologies.
Finally, according to the establishments of punishment, the conditions are more or less convenient to the initiation or perpetuation of sophisticated treatment plans.
Nevertheless, it is essential to treat all prisoners as well as other patients.
There should be no barriers to quality care.
This is the carer’s contribution to enable the prisoners to undertake rehabilitation work and hope to avoid recidivism.
If the prison is a place of loss of liberty, it should not be a place of deprivation of dignity.


Title
The Alzheimer’s disease and odontology

Abstract
The Alzheimer’s disease and dementia have become a stake in public health.
They engender later a major physical, intellectual and social dependence which impact on the social life of the patient and his family.
It is the main cause of heavy dependence of the elderly and of entrance to institution.
The hospitable practitioners of the pole have different areas of medical specialization (cardiology, oncology, rheumatology, neurology, diabetology, odontology) and are trained to the geriatrics.


Title
Biotherapy and dental care

Abstract
Biotherapies is the use of a molecule, cells, even tissue for therapeutic means.
Currently, one of the other major bio-therapeutic tools are monoclonal antibodies and their by-products.
They came into being notably thanks to remarkable molecular engineering, a cornerstone for therapeutic tools in a wide range of clinical domains such as oncology, hematology and gastroenterology.
As with the anti-TNFα and the anti-IL-1 biotherapies are specific immunotherapies which have the particularly interesting applications for inflammatory rheumatism and auto-immune diseases.
Their production and use on a large scale have been made possible thanks to enormous progress in the biotechnology industry.
However, carrying out surgery during anti-TNFα treatment can, theoretically, result in a higher risk of infections in pre or post-surgery.
The prospects for biotherapies are huge.
Not only are the correct indications to be defined along with the most pertinent therapeutic strategy to follow but also the tolerance of long to very long use of these new molecules.
Their use is becoming more and more frequent and it is necessary to know what precautions to take for one’s patients during odontological care.


Title
The pari-implant gingiva

Abstract
In the early days of dental implantology, the transgingival emergence of the implant was a major topic of controversy; some thought that the resulting breach provided a way in for bacterial organisms, whereas others were convinced that this structure was in fact sealed.
This controversy has since died down, the most recent studies having revealed something equivalent to an epithelio-conjunctive attachment to the titanium, which ensures that the tissues are in fact sealed around the implanted pillar.
However, it seems necessary to reiterate these ideas in order to establish a sound scientific basis, necessary but often overlooked, for the treatments proposed for disorders of this sulcus.


Title
The implant-prosthesis connection

Abstract
The latter criterion depends on the implant-prosthesis connection.


Abstract
The techniques for immediate single-tooth implant following tooth extraction are now well-defined.
The actual challenge is to obtain successful aesthetic outcomes and not only high survival of implants.
Osseous resorption, especially buccal, and soft tissue recession are the main issues we are being faced with.
As the immediate single-tooth implant in fresh extraction socket can’t make up for tissue loss, several approaches have been put forward.
The aim of this article is to show the aesthetic and biological interest of immediate provisional restauration in the extraction-implantation one-step technique.
The provisional restauration allows to guide periimplant soft tissue response.
Resorting to this provisional restauration requires specific know-how and rules.
With single tooth-implant, in order to avoid early micro-movements that could jeopardize initial implant stability and future implant osseointegration, we prefer immediate nonfunctional loading to immediate functional loading.


Abstract
At present, there is ever-growing demand for implant-supported prostheses, which require a sufficient volume of bone and therefore, in some cases, require additional bone.
Additional bone can be provided in the form of autogenic bone or biomaterials.
There is not yet a consensus about which type of graft to use.
Therefore, after having presented the indications and the various different techniques used, we will present some cases treated and their outcomes.
This article does not set out to be exhaustive.
The surgeon, whether (s)he is a maxillo-facial surgeon or a dental surgeon, must be aware of the indications, contraindications, techniques and how to deal with complications.
As in all surgical procedures, the surgeon’s experience is an obvious asset.

Pre-implant surgery in the dental department of the University Hospital of Dijon

Abstract
The department of odontology of the University hospital of Dijon proposes to the liberal practitioners of the region an activity of recourse for certain acts, among which features the pre-implant surgery.
If we consider protocols proposed to the patient, in this subject, for its care, we shall find essentially the onlay graft, with autogenous bone graft, and the sinus graft with filling (and or without taking).
After the presentation of the pre-implant surgery’s indications, the preoperative stages and the specific characteristics of these various techniques, a presentation of our pre-implant surgery activity in figures and graphs will enclose this presentation.


Title
Descriptive and functional anatomy of the temporomandibular joint

Abstract
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a complex joint, with the mismatched articular surfaces adapting to one another via the tendon of the lateral pterygoid muscle which slides between them during all jaw movements.
There are no anatomical or clinical correlations between the significance of a joint condition and the severity of symptoms experienced by the patient.
The descriptive anatomy of the TMJ is well-known despite some variability, but its dynamic aspects are less so due to the lack of an imaging system adapted to three-dimensional follow-up of an individual in real time.
A multidisciplinary approach to TMJ dysfunctions has prompted a more in-depth knowledge on the functional anatomy of this joint to be developed.
Motor and sensory innervation is derived from the mandibular nerve, which may lead to a vicious circle between spasms and pain.
A causal relationship with otological symptoms present in some cases of TMJ dysfunctions cannot be considered as standard.


Title
Anatomic basis of the maxillary sinus approach for implantology

Abstract
The maxillary sinus is an intra-maxillary bone cavity which often represents a difficulty to place dental implants in superior premolar and molar areas.
A surgical approach to the sinus is sometimes necessary via its anterolateral and posterolateral faces in order to elevate the sinus floor with bone or biomaterials.

Title
Odontogenic myxoma of the maxilla: report of a case

Abstract
Introduction.
Odontogenic myoma (OM) is a rare and locally invasive benign neoplasm found exclusively in the jaws, derived from embryonic mesenchymal elements of dental anlage.
Symptoms and radiographic features are variable, so they can lead to confusion with others radiolucent lesions.
Observation.
This article presents a rare case of OM occuring in the maxilla of a 16 year’s old male patient.
The lesion grows without symptoms and presents as a painlaiss sweeling.
Computed tomographics images show osteolytic expansile lesion of the right maxilla invading the maxillary sinus.
Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a myxoma.
Discussion.
Diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological and histological features.
The odontogenic myxoma local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate requires a radical treatment beyond the limits of the lesion.
Loss resulting substance involves surgical repair or prosthetic.


Abstract
Periodontal disease is a polymicrobial infection whose treatment is essentially based on the elimination of causal bacteria.
This elimination can not be complete, which hence the notion of control of bacterial factor.
In fact, the bacterial recolonization of treated sites takes place in a few weeks and the return of periodontal pathogens may occur in the absence of continuous plaque monitoring by the practitioner.
Thus, a supportive periodontal therapy is necessary to maintain the control of the bacterial factor and prevent the reactivation of periodontal disease.
This therapy preserves teeth and maintains the results of active periodontal treatment.
Its success involves factors within the practitioner and patient.
This article aims to show the interest of periodontal maintenance, and describe the various factors influencing its effectiveness.


Title
Association between maternal periodontitis and preterm delivery according to causes: the case-control EPIPAP study

Abstract
The aim of this study was to analyze the association between maternal periodontitis and preterm birth according to the causes of preterm birth.
The EPIPAP study was undertaken at six French maternity units, 1108 women (cases) with preterm deliveries (<37 weeks’ gestation) and 1094 controls with deliveries at term (≥37 weeks).
Periodontal status was defined as no periodontitis, localized or generalized.
Cases were classified according to four causes of preterm birth (induced for preeclampsia, induced for intrauterine growth retardation, spontaneous or preterm premature rupture of membranes, other causes).
A significant association was observed between generalized periodontitis and induced preterm birth for pre-eclampsia (aOR=2.46; CI 95 % [1.58-3.83]).
Periodontitis was not associated with the other causes of preterm birth.


Title
Diabetes and periodontal diseases

Abstract
Diabetes and periodontal diseases are two chronic diseases with a high global prevalence and with complex clinical and biological relationships.
Many epidemiological studies have shown an increased incidence and severity of periodontitis in diabetics.
Immunosuppression in diabetics explains delay healing and specificity of periodontal therapy in those patients, but effectiveness of the treatment has been demonstrated.
The pathogenic mechanisms are still far from being fully elucidated.
In recent years, the inverse relationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been the subject of many researches.
Recent systematic reviews indicate that periodontitis is responsible for increasing the incidence, control and complications of diabetes and that conventional periodontal treatment (scaling and root planning) reduces glycated haemoglobin of 0.4%.
The biological mechanisms implicated remain to be analysed however it appears that inflammation and oxidative stress are involved.

Abstract
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the main psychotropic component of Cannabis indica.
This drug is surging down especially on adolescents from their thirteenth year.
Among the 28 European Union states, the French teenagers are the first Cannabis consumers.
Cannabis, the plant itself (leaves and female flowers) or its resin (hashish/shit) is mainly smoke associated with tobacco.
The resort to water pipe, by smoke cooling, allows to inhale in a single set 100 times more smoke than the simple cigarette puff.
The cannabis currently proposed by dealers is about 5 times richer in THC than that proposed thirty years ago.
THC is characterized by an exceptional lipophilia, which allows it to be stored in the organism lipids, especially in brain, where it persists for a few days and even up to a few weeks (up to 8), according to its consumption importance.
It develops a somatic toxicity: throat, chest and testis cancers, cardiovascular diseases;
it has noxious effects on pregnancy and child who will be born.
it disturbs perceptions, balance, movement’s coordination, working memory, it is desinhibitor.
It has clear relationships with schizophrenia, either for its triggering, or for its aggravation, inducing antipsychotic drugs resistance.
Cannabis encourages the consumption of other drugs of abuse (tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, as well as morphine-like drugs).


Title
The pathological periimplant gingiva

Abstract
Knowledge of the normal and pathological histology of the gums helps refine therapeutic protocols and adapt them to the observed pathology.
The surface condition of the implant as well as the covering of the gingival sulcus-implant interface by a removable prosthesis have an impact on gingival health and therefore on the long-term survival of the implant.


Title
Stem cells

Abstract

In the orofacial zone, these cells are present in tissues, accessible to the practitioner and can be used for regenerative therapies.


Abstract
Except for some partial prosthetic restorations (bonded fixed partial denture, lumineers), for each prosthetic treatment an imperative step of temporization is set by provisional restorations.
Latter, fulfilling several roles, can be performed both in the laboratory and at the dental office.
While indirect techniques (laboratory), ensuring optimal integration of the temporary prosthesis, are currently the most recommended and used techniques, they are still inapropriate for certain clinical situations.
Indeed, in emergencies, the dentist uses direct techniques of making provisional prothesis extemporaneously, pending laboratory provisional restorations.
These direct techniques, still current, also fully meet the requirements of any prosthetic restoration.

Management of infection risk in implantology

Abstract
Management of infection risk is a guarantee of success for any implementation.
The practitioner must ensure compliance with all rigor principles of asepsis and ergonomics at pre, per and post operative.
These principles concern mainly the chain of sterilization for all instruments and reusable tools, preparation and organization of the operating room, preparing patients and surgical team, ergonomics and movement control in peroperation, and finally waste disposal and local maintenance.


Abstract
The demand for facial esthetics from our patients is constantly growing and recurring in the consultation setting, particularly with teenagers and young adults.
Among these motives for consultation, we find the presence of dyschromia on the anterior maxillary area of the teeth.
In the modern dentist setting, the practitioner needs to offer solutions which take account of: the patient satisfaction, in eliminating theses defaults ; of the tissue economy, with the least damaging results, leaving idealy the possibility for another and feasible re-operation.
The aim of this paper is to update on yellow, orange or brown enamel discolorations.
The practitioner has to know the etiopathogenesis to imply the most adapted therapeutic, to reach his objectives and satisfy the patient.

Abstract
The evolution of esthetic restorations and the high claims of patients have led to take into account the use of post and core reconstructions that are also aesthetic.
Several options can then be considered.
However, when we are led to restore a stump beneath an existing ceramic crown, the decision is not obvious.
This work determines the conditions of this re-intervention, and describes the steps to restore the stump, using fiber posts, while preserving the ceramic crown.

Abstract
Psoriasis is a frequent chronic erythemato-squamous skin disease whom etiology is unknown.
Psoriasis, as periodontitis, is characterized by high inflammatory response implicated in numerous comorbidities.
The aim of our work is to study the link between psoriasis and periodontitis using a bibliographic research conducted on Medline.
We identified 5 clinical studies (3 case-control study, 1 controlled retrospective study and 1 prospective cohort study).
4 studies find a link between psoriasis and periodontitis, with a risk up to 3-fold for having periodontitis when you have already psoriasis and one clinical case-control study did not find any association.
The variability in protocols (inclusion criteria for periodontitis and /or psoriasis) and in the statistical analysis (confounding variables are often missing) limits these results.


Abstract
First introduced in 1987 and published in 1989, the technique of endosteal stimulation makes it possible to take account of the nature of the bone in the following two specific cases:
– For bone quality type I, with little vascularisation, different studies record a percentage failure from 12 to 58%.
Endosteal stimulation makes it possible to treat such cases where the percentage of failures does not exceed 5%;
– For bone quality type IV, with depleted bone trabeculae, the studies show percentage failures from 22 to 44%.
Endosteal stimulation makes it possible to treat such cases where the percentage of failures does not exceed 4.5%.
Histological work and publications help validate this technique and provide a fundamental response to clinical results.

Abstract
In Russia, at the end of the XVIIth and at the beginning of the XVIIIth, the dental art developed thanks to Peter the Great and his archiater, Nicolas Bidloo (1669-1735).
In 1706, Peter, in the same time, put him at the head of an hospital and of the first Medical Academy.
In the Instructio de Chirurgia in Theatro Anatomico Studiosis (1710), Bidloo wrote a chapter devoted to dental diseases and their treatments.
Thus, the dentistry art, which was founded under Peter the First, became an integrated part of medical science.


Title
The quarrel of the barbers, the surgeons and the physicians (XIIIth-XVIIIth centuries)

Abstract
In Middle-aged Europe, everything that regards the act of the hand upon the body comes under surgery.
At this time, physicians are also clerks, to whom the Church forbiddens to spill blood in 1163.
Surgery goes then to the barbers, a part of which creates a fraternity of surgeons : la Confrérie de Saint-Côme.
The others prefer to keep their title of barbers, while still operating surgery.
The following centuries are characterized by the fights for power between the Faculty of medicine, with theoretical knowledge, and the surgeons, with practical knowledge.
They’ll sucessively use the barbers to reach their ends, meanwhile a last category of « healers » is still acting in the country : the charlatans.
We’ll develop these quarrels and the statuses delivered by the kings along the centuries in order to regulate these professions, allowing surgery to expand rapidly during the XVIIIth century, before the French Revolution erase all the previous gains and benefits of knowledge.


Title
Treatments of the mutilated of the Great War

Abstract
The World War I, due to the strong development of the artillery, caused a considerable number of new injuries: the maxillofacial lesions.
These large dilapidations are gaping wounds which look so awful that many soldiers are left for dead on the battlefield.
The maxillofacial injuries are characterized by significant loss of substance affecting jaws and soft tissues of the face.
The facial reconstruction of these disabled ex-servicemen, the “gueules cassées”, requires the invention of new surgical techniques and design of innovative prostheses.
Health personnel such as maxillofacial surgeons and dentists have shown unprecedented inventiveness, thus contributing to the development of their specialties.

Abstract
In removable full prosthesis, prosthetic rehabilitation can be difficult, especially in the presence of an unfavorable ostéomuqueux environment, preventing the establishment of the prosthesis.
Indeed, a significant hypertrophy and crestal tuberosity requires surgical planning of the prosthetic space useful because these anatomical obstacles forcing the practitioner to harmful to compromise the stability of the prostheses, in terms of the extent of the base at the level occlusion and aesthetics.
Through this work, we will try to illustrate the difficulties inherent in the lack of prosthetic space in the horizontal direction and propose a course of action adequately address this problem for optimal prosthetic balance.


Abstract
With the increasing life expectancy and the aging world population, often, dentists have to renew their patients old complete dentures.
Muscle and / or joint disturbances often go with a non-centered occlusion, an undervaluated vertical dimension and deleted cusp embossing.
The use of transitional prosthesis helps evaluating the possibility to find back healthy support structures while optimizing the treatment in terms of comfort, predictability and commitment from the patient.
The objective of this work is to review, through a case report, the clinical attitude to adopt in reconditioning therapy, and highlight the interest of the transitional prosthesis in this approach.


Abstract
Prosthetic balance has been consistently linked to quality of bearing surface.
When supportive tissues are altered, the practitioner must first think to restore physiological, histological and anatomical behavior favorable for a qualitative prosthetic rehabilitation.
To set an ideal treatment plan that will ensure the best results, the practitioner must know the indications, counterindications and limitations of tissue conditioning either in pre or post prosthetic rehabilitation, as well as the properties of tissue conditioners.


Title
Allergy in the non-precious dental alloys: data of the literature and current solutions

Abstract
Non-precious dental alloys can be at the origin of sensitizations and allergies.
Nickel base alloys present higher potential of sansitization than cobalt base alloys.
Nickel hypersensitivity’s reactions would happen after a primary sensitization by a non dental contact.
It is also noticed that intra-oral presence of a known allergen could improve or induce an immunological tolerance to this allergen.
We present here the oral demonstrations of the allergical reactions, rare with difficult diagnosis but also remote demonstrations.
Some advices of odontological care of the patients are given with the current European directives.
The increasing request of more biocompatible materials led to the introduction of news stainless steels with less or without nickel content.
In european countries where NiCr alloys (nickel ≤1% weight) are yet authorized, they are less employed to the benefit of CoCr alloys.

Title
Contribution of the articulateur in dentistry

Abstract
An occlusor allows to build occlusal relationships in only one position: the maximal intercuspal, determined most of the time by the simple confrontation of the opposing cusps.
These constructions are at the origin of numerous errors during the movements of the mandible.
The very simplified use of a articulator will make possible to build prostheses taking of account these movements.


Abstract
The articulator is a valuable tool in the design and manufacture prosthetic.
It’s used by practitioners is often limited to mounting teeth and sometimes occlusal equilibration.
Yet, it has a major interest in pre-prosthetic stage of treatment.
Depending on the type of articulator, it allows the analysis of occlusal parameters and their materialization, quantify improvements surgical, to perform in accordance with the preliminary prosthetic analysis, transitional surgical guides and occlusal devices.
Thus, the preprosthetic study in articulator can dictate the type of prosthetic restoration based on aesthetic and functional considerations.
This work treats the interest of the articulator in pre-prosthetic for partial and complete dentures.
The authors propose through some clinical illustrations to highlight the role of the articulator in the appreciation of the complexity of clinical situations and the pre-prosthetic analysis which is capital in the success of treatment.

Title
Non-surgical treatment of sialolithiasis: sialoendoscopy and lithotrypsy

Abstract
Introduction.
This approach carries a certain morbidity, with a risk for the facial and lingual nerves.
For the last 20 years, the development of endoscopic technology and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ECL) have improved possibilities for minimally invasive treatment of sialolithiasis, avoiding surgery.
Materials and Methods.
3436 patients were treated from December 1988 to August 2010 at the Institut d’Explorations Fonctionnelles et d’Endoscopie des Glandes Salivaires (I.E.F.G.S.) in Paris, France.
ECL was employed for 1571 patients and sialendoscopy for 1865 patients, some patients receiving both treatments.
Both treatements were administered on an outpatient basis, with only local anesthesia, for adults as well as for children.
Results.
Sialoendoscopy was successful for lithiasis extraction in 96.4% of the cases (1402/1455).
Other pathologies were also treated at the same time with the same instrumentation, such as chronic infection and canal stenosis.
ECL fragmented 100% of the lithiases over an average of 6 applications; 67.2% were completely destroyed and 32.8% partially fragmented.
Symptoms completely resolved for 92% of the patients, whether or not residual fragments were visible on ultrasound.
No major complication occurred.
Discussion.
The success of sialendoscopy depends primarily on appropriate patient selection: lithiases smaller than 4 mm, permeable salivary canals and lithiases that are not enclaved in the gland.
ECL, on the other hand, was applicable to all types of lithiases.
The major drawback of ECL is its operator-dependency, due to the need for precise ultrasonographic visualisation of the lithiasis, and the length of treatment.
Conclusion.
Today, sialoendoscopy and ECL are major minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of sialolithiasis, and should be considered before considering a surgical approach.

Study of the depth of the groove in the lingual alveolar Moroccan totally edentulous

Abstract
Lingual region is a region rich in anatomical and histological parts coming into contact with the mandibular complete denture.
The mobilization of these elements by various functional movements may cause the instability of the prosthesis if they are not properly understood in the secondary footprint.
Our study aimed to compare the depth of the furrow alveolar-lingual in each region of the arch during various movements of the tongue in a complete edentulous Moroccan population.
The study found that every part of the lingual region is influenced by several movements simultaneously.
These movements may slightly change from one patient to another hence the interest to perform all movements of the tongue by the patient during the secondary footprint.


Title
The challenges of the unitarian implant

Abstract
The technique of the osseointegrated dental implant initiated by Branemark was aimed/ had the mission “princeps”, the treatment of complete mandibular agomphiasis, where there was flat and resorbed crests, that were leading to a chronic instability of the prosthesis and even to a rejection.
The fitting of “fixtures” as a support of the fixed prostheses on ”piles”, even though questionable as a concept plan,has not only allowed the recovery of the fonction, but also added a psychological value regarding safety and comfort.
By technical extrapolation, the surgery, parodontology advances, as well as bone grafting techniques, the supply of smart biomaterials and the evolution of prosthetic components have enabled to extend the concept of partial agomphiasis treatments and even unit ones.
These practices could lead to predict simple therapy and a result quite easy to predict/ foretell regarding a single implant.
Wrong analysis as lon as the obstacle of the adjacent teeth, the residual bony anatomy, the mucous environment and the nature of the connectics could influence the quality of implementation, specially in the previous areas where aesthetics must prevail.


Abstract
This case report illustrates the satisfactory functional and aesthetic results obtained by the multidisciplinary team of Cochin Hospital.


Abstract
After tooth loss, alveolar healing is accompanied by 3D physiological bone resorption.
Bone resorption can become pathological after imbrication of intrinsic and extrinsic factors prejudicing future prosthetic rehabilitation.
The goal of any prosthetic restoration rehabilitating full edentulism is to give the patient proper oral functions and aesthetic harmony.
Careful study of the case, efficient surgical protocols of bone tissue, preserving residual roots, implementation of restorative or inducer potentials, implant placement, prior supportive tissues preparation, compliance with the rules of the art of prosthetic achievement and a careful maintenance are all ways that preserve bone support and hence better prosthetic integration.
Our work aims to review the various means at our disposal to prevent bone resorption before, throughout and after prosthetic realization.


Abstract
The interest of the conservation on tooth roots in the Removable Complete Denture is no longer to demonstrate.
Besides maintaining the bone volume, which is involved in the aesthetic restoration, it plays an important role in the prosthetic retention (Supra Radicular Attachments) giving it a major indication to the mandible (reduced bearing surface).
However in some cases of Maxilla Atrophy (flat palate, thin tuberosity…), the indication of dental roots conservation makes the aesthetic result of the PACSR much more difficult to achieve, and even questionable.
The purpose of our work is to review the key success factors of supra root maxilla restorations that require prior thorough analysis in order to obtain balance optimization, insertion axis handling and aesthetic rendering.


Abstract
In Complete edentulous rehabilitation, many are the clinical situations where the mandible circumscribes the maxillary bone with a more or less important gap.
In these cases of mandibular prognathism, the prosthetic treatment becomes complex, and the prosthodontist must face on the one hand the obligation of functional result conditioning prosthetic balance and on the other hand the aesthetic requirement of increasingly demanding patients.
In addition to the rigorous realization of the various traditional stages of the complete prosthesis, it is necessary to control diverse parameters particularly mounting technique.
Through a clinical case, we will put forward the difficulties of the mandibular prognathism’s prosthetic management and the interest of the retention’s complementary means in the optimization of the treatment.


Abstract
Currently, the practitioner has a whole arsenal of retention system (axial attachments, anchor bars…) and since 2000; the Locator® attachment complemented the large number of axial attachments as part of rehabilitation by complete denture retained by implants.
The objective of this article is to describe the characteristics and specificities of this attachment, as well as step by step sequences of clinical use by direct method.


Title
Aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of a case of skeletal classe II by complete immediate denture

Abstract
The complete immediate denture is a treatment that can help the patient to overcome the psychological and physiological challenges associated with the transition to a full edentulous state.
It offers an immediate restoration of aesthetics and different oral functions and a good quality of bone and mucosal healing.
Achieving complete immédiat denture in cases of skeletal Class II has many difficulties relating to the registration of dental and osteo – mucosal surfaces (tissue duality), simulation of extractions and the lack of test of the anterior teeth is added the problem of occlusal management this kind of rehabilitation at the stage of registration of the maxilo- mandibular jaw relation and the montage of the prosthetic teeth’s.
The authors intend to show the therapeutic approach to be adopted in the treatment of these clinical situations by complete immediat denture.


Abstract
Edentulism is always seen as a handicap even when anatomical landmarks allow a succful complete-denrure conception.
Despite these difficulties we have to succeed our conception in order to reply to Housset triad: stability, retention and sustentation.


Title
The pain

Abstract
The pain is very often present in odontostomatology.
It is a biological entity with its appropriate receptors, its circuits of integration and especially the regulation of its transmission by the superior centers.
The knowledge of these mechanisms will make it possible to better understand it and facilitate the symptomatic tretment.


Title
Clinical anatomy of trigeminal pain: synthesis and applications in odonto-stomatology

Abstract
The trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve V) possess a synergic and favored report with the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve VII) in the proprioception of cutaneous muscles of the face and neck involved in the facial expressions of emotions, in particular that of the pain, as well as in the corneal reflex.
The trigémino-vascular, trigémino-cervical and trigémino-vagal systems, highlights a big polymorphism in the transmission of the pain within the spinal nucleus of this nerve.
The trigeminal nerve is thus not only the nerve of the oro-facial pain but still the main nerve of head and neck pain.
The trigeminal nerve is the main actor of the mythical “fear of the dentist“, and its conducts of “way out” type.
The dental and maxillofacial practices require an extensive knowledge of the descriptive and functional anatomy of this nerve to possess an essential and powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tool.


Title
Clinical anatomy of trigeminal pain: synthesis and applications in odonto-stomatology

Abstract
Compressive phenomena on the endocranial course of the trigeminal nerve (V) cause facial neuralgias of which neurosurgical care remains the final recourse.
When infectious, inflammatory or tumoral phenomena engage the nerve endings of the fifth nerve into its facial part, and in particular with the dental plexuses superior ( maxillary nerve V2) and inferior ( mandibular nerve V3), the anatomical and clinical data incite to use widely all the armamentarium which we have at present to calm the enormous nociceptive potential of this nerve.
Motor and sensory innervation is derived from the mandibular nerve, which may lead to a vicious circle between spasms and pain or may be responsible for a nociceptive trigeminal inhibition reflex.
The oro-facial pain is not correlated, in a reliable way, with any gravity of the underlying disease process even if it can represent a severe alarm which always must be considered itself as a full urgency.
The trigeminal nociception is a perpetual challenge in its clinical management on a daily basis.
The dental and maxillofacial practices require an extensive knowledge of the descriptive and functional anatomy of this nerve to possess an essential and powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tool.


Title
Neurophysiological approach of the muscle and muscle pain

Abstract
The muscle is a biological entity ordered by particular neurons: motoneurones.
Butmuscles also have a personal sensory innervation allowing to modulate their contraction or their stretching.
Every muscle has a personal physiology requiring adapted ranges of rest.
When these ranges of rest are not respected settles down the muscle spasm and the pain, very important factors of numerous articular pathologies which, once treated, will put an end to the abnormal muscular activity, therefore the pain.


Abstract
The French agriculture, agronomically and economically very efficient, is responsible for significant nitrogen losses to the hydrosystems and the atmosphere, causing severe environmental damages.
Based on the analysis of the SitraM database on commodity transport between French administrative departments and with foreign countries, a budget of agricultural goods has been established, in terms of imbedded protein-N fluxes, for seven groups of agricultural commodities.
The 95 French departments were grouped into 33 agricultural territories defined according to their geographical proximity and the similarity of their production system.
The results show the magnitude of commercial mobility of agricultural goods.
Trade exchanges between territories and with foreign countries in 2006 amount to 1.6 fold the national production.
Overall, France appears as net exporter of proteins with foreign countries, importing 284 ktonN/yr of feed and exporting 390 ktonN/yr mostly as cereals.
The analysis reveals the extreme specialisation of many territories into either cash crop or livestock farming, and allows distinguishing five major territorial ensembles on the basis of the magnitude and destination of their food and feed exchanges.
Controlling the nitrogen cycle and its perturbations by agriculture requires taking into account trade fluxes of agricultural commodities.


Abstract
The results show that innovation is more effective and sustainable when it is the product of a collective and partnership work.


Abstract
In Africa, the issue of land grabbing currently dominates debates about land management, but the role of national elites in this process is rarely empirically addressed.
This text aims at offering a first analysis of land market acquisitions by the national elite (“cadres”) in Côte d’Ivoire.
It shows that land purchase for rubber planting predominates, and that the areas concerned by the acquisitions remain relatively modest.
As in the case of transactions among villagers (mostly between natives and migrants), those involving cadres are socially embedded.
Those first results question the specificity of land transfers benefitting cadres, compared to transfers involving villagers.


Abstract
We developed an interactive electronic weed identification tool, AFROweeds, and an online network, Weedsbook, for agricultural change agents to aid communication and offer assistance to rice farmers with specific weed problems.
A second trial was done with the offline version, pre-installed on a tablet.
The average identification time was 6 min 34 s, with a success rate of 75%.
The online network Weedsbook, established alongside AFROweeds, was assessed by the test users as a useful additional aid, enabling agricultural change agents and agronomists to exchange information or request assistance on all aspects of weeds and weed management.
The potential improvements of both products are discussed.


Abstract
This paper assesses farmers’ willingness to pay for an efficient adaptation programme to climate change for Malaysian agriculture.
We used the contingent valuation method to determine the monetary assessment of farmers’ preferences for an adaptation programme.
We distributed a structured questionnaire to farmers in Selangor, Malaysia.
However, a significant number of respondents are not willing to pay for the adaptation programme.

Abstract
Resultshighlight that in order to involve less empowered actors and to guarantee equity and efficiency of the GI protection, a set of accompanying actions and policies is required.
Crucial issues concern how to fill the gap between the current practices and the rules of the Code of practices, the choices about the control system, and the provision of some public goods and services allowing the weakest actors to benefit of the protected GI as well.


Abstract
Forage marketing is a significant economic activity that sustains the development of urban and suburban livestock in Africa.
From December 2007 to March 2008, we carried out a study whose objective was (i) to inventory marketed forage and their uses in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, (ii) to describe the organization of the sector and (iii) to determine the nutritive value of the forage.
Prospections in 26 production sites and of taking away of forage as well as semi-structured interviews were carried out with 10 farmers located in the suburb of the city, 20 cattle sellers and 68 sellers in 15 forage permanent markets in Bobo-Dioulasso.
The analysis of the chemical composition of 17 identified forage species out of 30 was carried out.
The study revealed that the way the resources are exploited (which is in fact a gathering system) will certainly not be sustained in the medium term because some forage species are threatened and will likely disappear.
In addition, the study showed that the main forage species marketed in Bobo-Dioulasso contained quite high levels of nutrients for the domestic ruminants of the urban and suburban livestock for the period going from December 2007 to March 2008.
However, it is necessary that this sector's actors are better organized to ensure the sustainability of the supply of the city in forage and that appropriate measures are undertaken to preserve the many forage species that are at risk and to assist the different actors.


Title
Evolution of a milkshed and role of alternative milk collection centres in Egypt

Abstract
In Egypt, an agro-industrial company, in association with a non-governmental organization, began setting up milk collection centres within producers’ organizations in 2011.
The project was very active in the Beni Suef Governorate.
This article analyses the milkshed evolution over the past 50 years and the project impact.
Using interviews and historical data, a diachronic analysis was performed.
The evolution can be divided into four phases:
before 1980, dairy products were primarily sold on the local market;
from 1980 to 2000, a “milkshed centred” development drove the dairy sector;
from 2000 to 2011, the sector was driven by the demand in Greater Cairo;
and since 2011, the arrival of the agro-industry has introduced new dynamics in local milk collection.
Locally, the development of collection centres led to a rise in milk prices and improvements to milk hygienic quality.
Demographic and dietary changes have stimulated demand for dairy products.
Liquid milk collection has developed since the liberalization of public policies and improved infrastructure.
The agro-industry is struggling to penetrate the highly competitive local milk collection sector and the model's future is uncertain.

Title
Effect of leaf anatomy on the evolution of eriophyid mites of olive tree in Tunisia

Abstract
Selection of pest-resistant or -tolerant varieties is an important way for an integrated pest management.
Leaf histological study reveals that varieties having thicker cuticles (Chétoui, Picholine, Oueslati and Zarrazi) are less infested by mites.


Abstract
Sheep breeding in central Tunisia remains widespread, despite the many problems it had to face since the 1970s: climate hazards, socio-economic and cultural changes and the development of cropped area.
These changes have led to a decrease in forage resources from rangelands.
The aim of this study was to understand how families are able to maintain sheep breeding in such a context.
The study involved a survey among a sample of 60 farmers in 2012-2013.
We identified four types of livestock systems.
Three types are based on the raising of ewes and the production of lean or fat lambs.
“Transhumant pastoralists” are using long-distance mobility to access rangelands with wild vegetation, managed by the State.
“Crop-Livestock” farmers use stubble for pasture, along with other resources derived from farmed land and have a greater adaptive capacity to cope with changes.
Multi-active families are the most affected by the extension of crops at the expense of rangelands.
For these three systems, many farmers are thinking of decreasing their number of ewes or even giving up sheep farming, due to the difficulties they face.
A fourth “trader-fattener” system is strongly developing, based on fattening purchased lean lambs with grain, without raising ewes.
This activity is profitable in the short term but is vulnerable to price fluctuations of feed supplements.


Abstract
Dynamic Mediterranean and second Algerian city, Oran has faced a diffuse urbanization process.
Its rural fringe, just at the outskirts of the city, is today an area where important changes take place in the agriculture production system.
A redefinition of peri-urban agriculture is carried out by individual initiatives that result in agricultural diversification: developing high added-value crops, vegetables, and ornamental trees.
The structured interviews carried out with the peri-urban farmers allowed identifying the factors that are causing these changes.
The profit issued from the crops is in line with the increase in the urban demand; agricultural intensification is a response to the land insecurity created by urbanization and the excessive fragmentation of properties.


Abstract
The main aim of this study was to identify the factors that drive the prices of agricultural property after Poland's accession to EU in regions where agriculture is the predominant mode of production.
A statistical model of real estate prices was developed based on the conducted transactions.
The key determinants of agricultural property prices were: location of land relative to rural settlements, soil quality, land fragmentation, forest cover in the municipality and location of farms in less-favored areas with natural handicaps for agricultural production.
The last attribute results from Poland's membership in the European Union and participation in the Common Agricultural Policy.
The support scheme increased the prices of agricultural property.
Our results are largely consistent with the findings of international studies.
They provide valuable inputs for prospective buyers of agricultural property and investors.


Abstract
This study assesses the impacts of using agro-industrial byproducts as fish feed in Côte d’Ivoire fish farming.
Among them, 53% used exclusively agro-industrial byproducts.
Rice bran (52%) and the combination of rice bran and corn bran (28%) are most used.
The average price of these agro-industrial byproducts ranged between 20 and 105 FCFA/kg.
Oreochromis niloticus and Heterotis niloticus are the main fish species found on the farms.
Fish farmers are for the most Ivoirians farmers aged more than 40 years.
The farms yields are relatively small for all the systems (544 to 2445 kg/ha/yr), with average daily weight gain estimated at 0.87 and 9.97 g/day for tilapia and heterotis, respectively.
Growth and production data indicate the need to define the support and financing strategy of fish farming in order to increase the capacity of the fish farmers to use low cost quality fish feeds formulated with locally available raw materials.


Abstract
Piliostigma reticulatum pods are increasingly exploited and marketed in Burkina Faso.
As little knowledge exists about this activity, a survey was conducted in 2009 in the northern Sudan zone with 90 persons.
Resultsshow that gathering and processing pods is run by illiterate and poor women of 20- to 60-year-old.
An average of 20, five and 10 tons is gathered by 20–35-year-old, 36–50-year-old and 51–60-year-old women, respectively.
Looking for new markets is the main solution proposed by young- and medium-aged women while older women want to fight against anarchic tree exploitation and livestock stray and graze.
The results of this study demonstrate that gathering and processing P. reticulatum pods contribute to fight against poverty among rural women, decrease the unemployment rate and provide forage for animal breeders during the dry season.


Abstract
Kwlikwli or kluiklui are processed out of groundnut butter partially defatted and fried.
Better knowledge on African consumers’ food preferences is a condition for local products promotion.
However, a specific quality is required even by these low income groups.
Many urban consumers are originating from the Agonlin area and have developed stable ties to a petty trader, who is herself linked to the region of origin.
In the future, consumers’ linkages to the origin may well require a more active strategy.


Title
Thinking about the categorization of social forms in Central Europe

Abstract
Farming is organized in different forms in the countries of Central Europe where collectivization had been implemented.
The very different agrarian structures may be defined using conventional statistical and normative classifications.
This article identifies the various social forms considering how they have arisen and evolved from the privatization process.
Most of these forms such as the tiny semi-subsistence farms or the large corporate units are different than seen in the former member states of the European Union.
Based on the assumption of a family norm, the “European model of agriculture” appears to be unsuitable to countries where large and medium family farms scarcely existed.
The article considers the perverse distributive effects of extending an agricultural support policy (the so-called SAPS) to structures for which it had not been designed.


Abstract
The intensification of maize cultivation, mainly for rural consumption and cities supply, is an opportunity to improve food security in the Northern regions of Cameroon, and to face land constraints.
To study its feasibility, three levels of intensification have been tested in 2013 in 32 maize fields near Garoua in the Northen Region, of which 16 considered fertile by farmers, and 16 as degraded: (i) the conduct by the producer (CP), (ii) a first level of intensification (NI1) corresponding to the currently recommended agricultural specifications, and (iii) a second level of intensification (NI2), which compared to NI1 benefited of a strengthening in fertilization, improved seed treatment, better density and weeds control.
CP and NI1 have close yields in both villages: an average of 2.3 and 1.3 t.ha–1, respectively on fertile and degraded fields, proving that producers follow pretty much the broadcast technical specifications.
Yields on plots under NI2 are significantly superior to others, on average of 1 t.ha–1 at the Ngong site where rainfall is lower, and 1.5 t.ha–1 at the Gashiga site.
Curiously, the yield gain provided by NI2 is identical on fertile plots as on degraded ones, indicating that the degradation of the recent years, demonstrated by their lower production, nevertheless allows a response to increased intensification.
Despite these results, the profitability of an increased intensification at the current price of corn, especially the one at the harvest time, is not established.
A better price would allow the profitability of an increased intensification and production of corn in these areas as already partially practiced by some emerging farms, as they are named, which have more control over the marketing of their products.


Abstract
The new architecture of the development financing is in the way of reorganization, marked by the multiplication and the diversification of the actors and the growing interweaving of the public and private financing.
The will to attract new private operators leads to the implementation of financial mechanisms where the public funds are supposed to play leverage.
This evolution questions the capacity of African States to address the big issues of development such as food security, reduction of poverty and modernization of agriculture.
A comparative study in three West African countries (Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Ghana) provides some answers.
The national institutions are generally too weak to channel the new flows of financing towards the agricultural policy objectives.
The disparities of financing of the farming sector, already marked in the past, are aggravated there and the global increase of the amounts of financing comes along with the concentration of these for the benefit of the entrepreneurial farmers and to the detriment of family farmers, of public goods and of certain enclosed regions.


Abstract
This article explores actors’ rationales regarding their participation in rural land sales and tenancy markets in the context of Transylvania (Romania).
The analysis of land practices highlights the low dynamism of the land sales market, linked to a thin supply.
The landowners potentially most likely to sell – those who lack the means to directly use their land, or are involved in off-farm activities – very often favor leasing out their land.
This ensures them a regular source of income or product (in the case of in-kind leases), supplementing the household's often meager revenues, and maintains the land patrimony (including land property as a realizable asset in case of necessity).
Other landowners plan to sell their land but prefer to rent it out on the short run, because of an expected increase in land prices.
Facing a lack of supply on the sales market, the potential buyers of land have to lease in land.
This situation has led to the emergence of reverse tenancy configurations.


Abstract
In the current period of milk crisis, the “comté” cheese value-chain is described as an example of economic success.
Considering this value-chain as an illustration, this paper explores the importance of social capital to enhance adaptive capacities.
After defining these concepts, we present the social capital of the “comté” value-chain, combining different types of social links between its actors, with its specific small cooperative units (“fruitières”) and inter-professional organization.
On the basis of the internal journal of the value-chain and the literature, we show how these social links enable to adapt cheese production to the demand, in order to maintain high milk price.
Furthermore, we show that social capital can also be used as a source of innovation for other issues, with practical examples in the social domain (evolutions of cheese markers’ working conditions) and in the technical domain (improvement of cheese quality and farm self-sufficiency).
The social capital of the value chain is exposed to a risk of erosion, but at the same time it enables to cope with this risk of its own erosion.
These dynamic perspectives are discussed in the conclusion, as well as perspectives and general lessons.


Abstract
The comprehension of the relations that human society have with their environment helps to anticipate the obstacles to rural development measures planned thanks to the comprehension of local mechanisms governing access to land and resources.
This study describes the land tenure, typology of space and land uses in a densely populated village (65 inhabitants/km2) located 100 km north of Yaoundé and populated by citizens of the ethnic subgroup Gunu.
The land tenures are strong and go up to the official recognition of private property.
Any relaunch of the cocoa sector will take place in highly contested areas, and perhaps at the expense of the last remnants of natural formations with a major effect on gender division of labor and land appropriation.


Abstract
An increase of agricultural production could theoretically improve dietary diversity through two main pathways: self-consumption or purchase of more diverse foods thanks to a better agricultural income.
However, in some Western African regions with relatively high level of agricultural production, a low diversity of food consumption has been observed.
Our objective was to assess whether the dietary diversity of women was associated with the diversity of cultivated crops and/or with sales of agricultural production at the level of the farm household in rural Burkina Faso.
A representative sample of 579 farm households in the Hauts-Bassins Region was surveyed at three different periods between May 2013 and January 2014.
We estimated different indicators of agriculture diversity: the number of crop species, of local tree species in the farm plots, and of animals species.
From a qualitative 24-hour recall of food consumption, we computed the dietary diversity score for women according to recent international recommendations (number of food groups consumed out of 10).
This score was low and did not vary across seasons, but the food groups composing it changed.
Resultsof a multiple regression showed that, in May and August 2013, women dietary diversity was not associated with the number of crops but with the number of local spared tree species.
Sales value was weakly related with a better dietary diversity at all seasons, while the association was stronger with women agricultural (in May 2013) and non-agricultural incomes.
At all seasons, women receiving cash transfers from the head of farm household had far higher dietary diversity scores than those who did not.
Finally, women control over resources seems to better warrant women dietary diversity that the level of agricultural production at the farm household level.

The accurate quantification of crop residue biomass left on the soil after harvesting is important, due to the agricultural and environmental issues associated with the management of soil organic matter in croplands.


Abstract
Access to land for the young generation of farmers is hardly taken into account in the debates concerning agriculture sustainability in Southern countries.
In these countries, where the population is often very young, procedures for transfer of agricultural assets are frequently absent and generally ineffective when they exist.
We analyze the role of indirect farming in creating flexibility in local land use systems and discuss the sustainability of the resulting dynamics.
We finally discuss the major challenge for policy makers in Tunisia and North Africa to include informal agriculture in policy making to provide more sustainable perspectives.
Better knowledge about the role of indirect farming in providing flexibility to local land use and agrarian systems can provide ideas for a better use of land and water resources, which are contested in Tunisia and elsewhere in North Africa.


Abstract
Since the beginning of the 2000s, resilience and food security have become associated in literature.
However, the diversity of terminology shows that this association is not so easy.
This paper objective is to assess the state of the art concerning the different forms of associations between food security and resilience.
Does using resilience in the food security field and in the social-ecological system field, highlight the same features?
Therefore, do several resilience concepts exist?
What does it bring to programs and analysis carried out into food security field?
What difficulties and challenges does this integration cause?


Title
Fragility of family livestock projects in mixed farming systems in Burkina Faso

Abstract
In mixed farming systems in Burkina Faso, farmers have difficulty to implement family livestock projects (FLPs) meeting their expectations in terms of income and services.
This study aims to investigate and to explain the causes of these weaknesses.
The study was implemented in western Burkina Faso on cattle FLPs.
It showed that all farmers had FLP ideas in mind.
A monitoring was performed on draft animals, cattle for fattening and dairy cows FLPs during the design and implementation steps.
It showed that the majority of FLPs failed even before their implementation, due to lack of preparation or unrealistic objectives.
The implemented FLPs have important weaknesses concerning feeding control, which reduce their profitability.
This diagnosis enabled us to set up the principles of a PEF step by step co-design method, to assist farmers to better prepare their FLP, to better manage animals feeding during their implementation and to better evaluate the outputs of the FLP.


Abstract
The paper aimed to evaluate the level of development of agriculture in 25 member states of the European Union (EU) in 2010–2013.
The analysis was carried out using the development model proposed by Hellwig, which enabled the calculation of a single synthetic aggregate measure based on the characteristics of agriculture in respective countries.
This made it possible to compare the analysed member states, thus providing the basis for allocating them to uniform groups characterised by a similar level of agricultural development.
The results indicate that the Netherlands and Denmark are the countries with the highest level of agricultural development.
The studies also show that the worst level of development in the ranking is presented primarily by the member states that acceded to the EU in 2004 and later, with agriculture in Slovakia and the Czech Republic being an exception.
The diversification of the values of synthetic measure in respective member states points to a considerable diversification of agricultural development within the EU, which is determined both by the production potential and the effectiveness of its utilisation.


Abstract
This paper analyses investments from the People's Republic of China in the Ivorian agriculture.
Foreign direct investments, not linked to aid, involve various stakeholders and their conflicting strategies.
Are they independent of the Chinese State or its provinces?
In Ivory Coast, these investments are exclusively related to cocoa and rubber industries and involve only two Chinese giants of food industry and trading.
Cornerstone of the post-1994 Sino-African relations, these actors are at the heart of Chinese business strategies and its cooperative Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).
Ultimately, at their level, they contribute to the financialization of the agricultural sector and to the rise to power of the now globalized “China Corp.”.

Settling of young farmers and pluriactivity in Costa Rica

Abstract
This paper studies the settling process of young farmers in two communities in Costa Rica resulting from land reforms.
We show an important social change with the development of part-time farming activity.
Our analysis highlights the necessity to consider the diversity of settling processes to promote adapted policy aiming at facilitating the generational renewal in family agriculture.


Abstract
In France, a derogation to pesticide regulation allows spraying on blooms with insecticides or acaricides bearing the bee label (mention « Abeilles »), but only when no bees are foraging on crops.
Nevertheless, no decision rule is available for farmers to assess bees’ absence on the crop.
To fill this gap, the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a reflection about environmental and climatic factors influencing the presence of forager bees.
This review takes an inventory of data available about foraging activity according to environment or weather.
Decision rules based on such criteria appear inappropriate.
Only nocturnal sprays of pesticides on crops significantly reduce the risk of bees’ exposure to chemicals.


Abstract
This study, conducted in the eastern part of the city of Lomé (capital and largest city of Togo), highlights the spatial dynamics of market gardening under land pressure.
TerraMetrics satellite images from Google Earth archives for 2002, 2008 and 2014 were selected for the market gardening evolution analysis.
A field survey based on semi-structured questionnaires was conducted to identify the gardeners’ strategies.
The observation points that geographical coordinates were recorded using a GPS sensor.
Garden areas were evaluated using the QGIS software coupled with the Excel spreadsheet.
The spatial and descriptive evolution of the market gardening areas since 2002 has thus been known.
It was also possible to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of these areas and to evaluate the strategies developed by the gardeners to cope with the land shortage.
Market gardening land status is precarious;
in average, surveyed gardeners lost 31 ha per year between 2002 and 2014, the total market gardening surface area falling from 530 to 160 ha.

Abstract
The experiences synthesised in this article indicate how significant effects in two agricultural domains have been achieved by creating pathways for inter-dependent socio-technical and institutional changes, at a range of levels of action, governance and policy-making.
The synthesis emphasizes the importance of co-learning, experimentation, and critical reflection among a wide network of ‘champions’ of transformational change on behalf of smallholder farmers and processors.
It shows that innovation processes may involve actors along entire value chains, industry leaders at national level, or local level actors seeking to widen the space for change beyond their immediate circle of direct influence.
While the research and development initiatives of the domains are shown to have been critical in identifying the constraints and opportunities of smallholders, and also to the effects documented, this was largely because the research effort converged around empirically grounded problems and opportunities identified.
The information sought, and the solutions found useful, were determined by the members of innovation platforms that drove the processes of change.

Social capital and conflict management in the irrigated scheme of Malanville in Benin

Abstract
This paper analyses the influence of social capital in conflict management within self-governing irrigation systems through the case study of Malanville irrigated scheme in Benin.
It shows that water users valorize efficiently bonding social capital when a conflict relates to operational rules.
Linking social capital contributes to destroy bonding social capital in a conflict related to collective and constitutional rules.
State agencies mediation was therefore required to resolve the conflict.
Resultssuggest that a synergy approach between self-governing systems and state agencies is necessary for a better conflict management.


Abstract
The intercontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIV) in 2005–2006 triggered an important research effort on the epidemiology of AIV in wild birds and at the wild/domestic bird interface.
Wild birds are the host of the majority of low pathogenic AIV that may evolve into highly pathogenic strains once introduced into poultry populations, causing a risk for animal and public health.
The work undertaken during the last 10 years in afro-tropical ecosystems explored the eco-epidemiology of AIV in wild and domestic birds.


Abstract
Oil palm is an important industrial, livelihood and food crop in Ghana.
Smallholders produce the bulk of the palm fruits and small-scale processors, mainly women, produce most of the crude palm oil.
Poor practices lead to a high proportion of free fatty acids in the crude palm oil and the processors thus cannot access remunerative national and international markets.
Exploratory and diagnostic studies identified the absence of rules and regulations governing processing as a major factor.
An innovation platform was convened and facilitated to remove the identified institutional constraints.
Based on event tracing, this paper reports a study of the effects of the innovation platform's interventions and how these were achieved.
Institutional entrepreneurs are shown to play important roles: they mobilised resources such as expertise, knowledge, access to information and high-level political power to influence small-scale processors to adopt alternative practices.
The institutional changes observed are shown to arise in cooperation between traditional authorities (chiefs), the district legislature and authorities at the national level, who together institutionalised the experimental actions and processes taken in the study area.
The institutional elements they most affected were: rules and regulations, the legitimacy of new practices and organisational arrangements, co-generation of knowledge, material resources, and the strategic and communication skills of key actors.

Abstract
This article analyses the development of a system for producing and distributing hybrid oil palm seedlings to small-scale famers.
The existing seed system had become so corrupted that the seedlings actually planted were largely of unimproved kinds.
The article describes institutional experiments carried out by two Innovation Platforms (IPs) in order to improve the oil palm seed system.
Theory Guided Process Inquiry was used to document, evaluate and analyse these interventions.
Improvement of the oil palm seed system was included in the government's latest 5-year development plan.


Abstract
This paper presents insights gained from a cross-analysis of 13 agricultural innovation experiences in three African countries (Benin, Kenya and South Africa).
The participatory assessment was conducted with a common analytical framework and inspired by the agricultural innovation system (AIS) perspective and focused on understanding how innovation unfolded over time as a result of diverse triggers and drivers under the influence of a diversity of stakeholders.
Findings show the diversity of stakeholders engaged in innovation, and the nature of the innovation triggers and drivers.


Title
Twenty years of aquaculture in North Africa: developments, critical assessment and future

Abstract
This paper presents the evolution of aquaculture in North Africa during the 20 last years, and the assets and bottlenecks for each country.
This work uses the results of the European project Aquamed (2011–2013).
This double overview, on the past and the future, should help decision-makers and experts to identify the best politics for a sector, which has a high potential in the region.


Abstract
Using the diversity of animal genetic resources is considered as one possible way toward sustainability of livestock farming systems.
Emphasis is generally put on local breeds regarding their adaptation to the conditions and farming systems in their territory of origin.
In this paper, we show how using some breeds, local or not, may modify farming systems and, then, contribute to their sustainability.
Two case studies were conducted on dairy farming systems in Western France, one dealing with two cattle breeds recently introduced in this region, namely the Montbéliarde and Simmental breeds, the other one dealing with the rare and local Bretonne Pie Noir breed.
The results of these studies were interpreted within a conceptual framework inspired by the pragmatist theory of inquiry.
We conclude that the concept of “locally adapted breed” has to be associated with the concept of “locally adopted breed”.


Abstract
In a context of rapid urbanization, the insularity of Reunion Island makes waste management complex and calls for finding recycling solutions.
Official requests for authorizing the spreading of sewage sludge on sugarcane are a source of conflict.
In agriculture, following the land reform of the 1960s, these transformations first resulted in the emergence of a family farming directly bound to the agroindustrial sugar sector, at the expense of large landownership.
Then, from the sugar sector logic to today's territorial and environmental issues seized by farmers, this new agriculture of Reunion Island demonstrates the ability of the society to reformulate its concerns by gradually replacing obsolete frameworks.


Title
A typological analysis of livestock diversity and performances in the oases

Abstract
Livestock is a crucial component in the oasis agricultural systems.
This would allow better assessing the public policies that have been implemented, targeting the efforts of the agricultural development agencies in the area, and orienting public support policies towards the alleviation of the most prominent constraints.


Abstract
Launched in France in 2008, the national “Ecophyto” plan, aiming “if possible” at a reduction of 50% of the pesticides use within 10 years, is a failure.
After the first five years of its implementation, pesticide consumption has increased.
Acknowledging this failure, the French government recently announced a new version of the plan (Ecophyto 2) although some aspects of its content remain unknown.
For the authors of this paper (agronomists and sociologists), failure was predictable, given the characteristics of Ecophyto 1's implemented actions.
They show it by the analysis of two of the flagship initiatives of the plan (monitoring health plant “bulletin”, database allowing to assess in real time the risks of pests, and the “DEPHY farms”, an experimental network supposed to disseminate good practices, and the study of the indicator measuring pesticide use.
Butthe failure is even more due to the plan's main focus on farmers and advisors practices regardless of the broader effects of the “socio-technical lock-in” including a wide range of actors all interdependent and strongly engaged in pesticides’ logic of uses.


Title
The dromedary and the oasis: from caravanserai to periurban farm

Abstract
Relations between dromedary and oasis belong to a certain ambiguity because the dromedary, animal of the nomad, marks the desert by its mobility while the oasis is, by essence, a point of attachment.
If, throughout history, the camel was entering in the city for the caravan steps (caravanserais), he remained rarely inside except to play the role of auxiliary in the oasis agriculture.
Change in production systems, increase in demand for animal proteins to supply a growing urban population, and social expectations of the nomadic pastoralists in education and health have contributed to change the relationships between the camel farms and the oasis city.
The development of periurban camel farming system both for milk and meat supply has upset the former links between nomads and sedentary people, resulting in an increasing interpenetration of the activities brought by both.
The paper relies on several examples of development in Saharan Africa (Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia), Sahel Africa (Chad, Niger), Middle East (Saudi Arabia) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan).

Abstract
The human papilloma virus is responsible for many kinds of proliferative lesions of the oral mucosa.
The aim of this article is to assess two pathologies among the most frequently observed, condyloma acuminate and focal oral hyperplasia.
From the study of three young girls seen in a mission in Chad, and a literature survey, we consider the epidemiological chain, by describing the lesions, and specifying their pathogenesis and their mode of transmission, leading to positive and differential diagnoses and the therapeutic aspects.
This case report shows a departure from the conventional theory of transmission by sexual contact, and the consequences of this for children.


Abstract
Possibly the inverse jaw stretch reflex may exist but its central neural pathways are unknown.
Reflex modulation implies that reflexes are not stereotyped and that their gain is changing across the tasks.
They are modulated by segmental and/or suprasegmental drive.
Thus, in chronic orofacial pain conditions, the jaw-closing muscle stretch reflex is either unchanged or inhibited.


Abstract
Mastication and deglutition are rhythmic automatic behaviours driven by the segmental central pattern generators (CPG), but they are also strongly modulated by peripheral afferent feed-back.
The interrelationship between the manducatory apparatus and cervical spine is under study, e.g. jaw opening and closing are in phase, but with a delay, with cervical spine extension and flexion, respectively (this implies cervical feed-forward motor regulation).

Abstract
Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory dermato-mucosal disease which gets all the regions of the buccal mucous membrane.
There are four phases of the evolution of the OLP: the initial phase, the phase of state, the late phase and the post-lichenien state.
Given that the OLP represents a frequent disease, with whom the dentist often confronts, our work concerns a detailed review of the literature on the natural history of the OLP, the clinical and histological aspect, its etiopathogeny, its association with the other diseases, the treatment and finally its malignant transformation.

Abstract
Groundnut is cultivated in over 100 nations around the world.
Main producers are China and India, which are providing more than 60% of the production.
Africa realizes 25% of the production, thanks mainly to Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan.
In Senegal, in the 60’s, groundnut culture was developed as an industrial production (oil and meal) export-oriented, with an increasing opening up of the world trade market.
This culture used to be the engine of Senegal’s economic development, to ensure until 80% of exportations and to provide the main part of cash incomes in rural areas.
But, from 1970 and particularly since the 1990s, groundnut market entered a deep crisis and the various agricultural policies have not resulted, until now, in a relaunch of the sector.
This paper is a review of informations collected in Senegal.
It stresses how important is the culture, studies production and commercialization, underlines the production constraints and presents ideas to relaunch the sector.


Title
Vitamin D: sources, metabolism and mechanisms of action

Abstract
Confined for a long time to its role in calcium and phosphate metabolism, vitamin D appears today as a vitamin with a large potential, through its involved in many physiological processes.
Due to its double origin (from food and endogenous synthesis), vitamin D is a vitamin apart, with sources and requirements difficult to define that are currently discussing.
However, the metabolism of the vitamin D begins to be known more precisely.
This metabolism involves a first hepatic hydroxylation leading to the formation of 25(OH)D and second hydroxylation in kidney resulting in the formation of 1,25(OH)2D, the active metabolite of vitamin D.
This metabolite is responsible for the various genomic and non-genomic effects of vitamin D, whose mechanism of action involves a specific nuclear receptor, the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), and various signaling pathways controlled by a membrane receptor, the protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (Pdia3).

Regulations on the labeling and preservation of olive oil

Abstract
Olive oil is the oil obtained solely from the fruit of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.).
Analytical methods are essentials to distinguish between those different categories of olive oils.


Abstract
Effect of environmental factors and cultivar on linseed composition and subsequent oil expression has been studied.
Ten linseed cultivars were grown in two different location (north and south of France) during years 2011, 2012 and 2013.
Every year have been characterized in terms of pluviometry, sunshine hours and degree days, each climatic factor has been cumulated from flowering to harvest.
A strong impact of cultivar on oil, C18:3 and starch content has been noticed whereas the growing location has only affected the starch and lipid contents.
Year effect have been recorded on proteins, oil and C18:3 content.
A principal component analysis has highlighted the correlation between the pluviometry and the C18:3 content.
Oil content have not presented any correlation with environmental or composition factors.
Oil expression using the seeds previously characterized has exhibited a strong correlation between C18:3 content and oil yield.
No correlation between oil yield and other composition parameters has been observed.
The analysis of variance conducted on yield has emphasized that yield variation was majority attributable to a year effect.


Abstract
Many enzymes metabolizing essential fatty acids (EFA) do not discriminate much between the n-3 and n-6 structures.
Thus, relative abundances of competing n-3 and n-6 acids influence relative rates of reaction during hydrolysis, activation, elongation, desaturation and acyl transfer that control the balance of n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) accumulated in tissues.
An empirical competitive, hyperbolic equation describes how dietary EFA maintain tissue HUFA balance.
The %n-6 in HUFA is a useful biomarker for average dietary intakes of n-3 and n-6 EFA.
The HUFA balance, expressed as the %n-6 in HUFA, is a useful biomarker for health risk assessment.
The biomarker makes evident that, in the absence of dietary n-3 nutrients, dietary n-6 linoleate has a very narrow therapeutic window, and it can be widened by dietary n-3 nutrients.
A useful concept for preventive nutrition is to NIX the 6 while you EAT the 3.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to optimize extracion of flaxseed oil process by ultrasonic treatment and determination of its effect on ω-3 fatty acid.
The extraction of flaxseed oil was optimized by using different solvents like methanol, acetone, petroleum ether, ethanol, hexane and dichloromethane.
The ultrasonication treatment was optimized with respect to amplitude (20–80 kHz), temperature (25–40 °C), sonication time (20–80 min) and solid to solvent ratio (1:5, 1:10 and 1:15) for extraction of flaxseed oil.
The extracted oil was subjected to GC analysis to determine ω-3 fatty acid.
The recovery of flaxseed oil was higher with hexane followed by dichloromethane.
The ultrasonic treatment at frequency of 40 kHz, temperature of 30 °C, extraction time of 40 min and solid to solvent ratio: 1:10 gave best results for extraction.
The ultrasonic assisted extraction improves the extraction yield by 11.5% with similar amount of solvent.
The chromatograph showed that there were no significant effects on α-Linolenic acid (ω-3) by the ultrasonic assisted extraction.
This will beneficial to the oil extractor to recover higher amount of oil from same amount of the raw materials.

The structure of the tariff schedule may have an important bearing on efficiency.


Abstract
Despite tremendous efforts in ischemic stroke research and significant improvements in patient care within the last decade, therapy is still insufficient.
There is a compelling, urgent need for safe and effective neuroprotective strategies to limit brain injury, facilitate brain repair, and improve functional outcome.
Recently, we reported that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, n-3) complexed to human albumin (DHA-Alb) is highly neuroprotective after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in young rats.
This review highlights the potency of DHA-Alb therapy in permanent MCAo and aged rats and whether protection persists with chronic survival.
We discovered that a novel therapy with DHA-Alb improved behavioral outcomes accompanied by attenuation of lesion volumes even when animals were allowed to survive three weeks after experimental stroke.
This treatment might provide the basis for future therapeutics for patients suffering from ischemic stroke.


Title
Why lutein is important for the eye and the brain

Abstract
Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids that accumulate in the macula.
The macula is a yellow spot near the center of the retina that is responsible of high resolution vision.
Macular pigment acts as a natural blue light filter and protects the eye from damage.
Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) increases with lutein administration and is related to visual function and to the prevention of age-related macular degeneration.
MOPD can be measured non-invasively and has been related to better cognitive performance.
Studies in non-human primates revealed that carotenoids are determinant in the formation of the retinal epithelia.
formula fed infants, preferential accumulation in the brain and evidences of influence on the retina and the functionality of the brain signal the importance of the role of lutein and zeaxanthin on visual maturation and brain development.


Abstract
Brain energy metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized mainly by temporo-parietal glucose hypometabolism.
This pattern has been widely viewed as a consequence of the disease, i.e. deteriorating neuronal function leading to lower demand for glucose.
This review will address deteriorating glucose metabolism as a problem specific to glucose and one that precedes AD.
Hence, ketones and medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) could be an alternative source of energy for the aging brain that could compensate for low brain glucose uptake.
MCFA in the form of dietary medium chain triglycerides (MCT) have a long history in clinical nutrition and are widely regarded as safe by government regulatory agencies.
The importance of ketones in meeting the high energy and anabolic requirements of the infant brain suggest they may be able to contribute in the same way in the aging brain.
Clinical studies suggest that ketogenesis from MCT may be able to bypass the increasing risk of insufficient glucose uptake or metabolism in the aging brain sufficiently to have positive effects on cognition.


Abstract
Heterozygous inheritance of mutant ELOVL4 causes juvenile macular degeneration in autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3).
Our group performed a series of studies using mice conditionally depleted of retinal Elovl4 (KO) aimed at understanding the role of VLC-PUFAs in long-term retinal health and function, focusing on the role of these fatty acids in mediating synaptic function between the photoreceptors and the rest of the neural retina.
The absence of VLC-PUFA from the retina of KO mice resulted in a marked decrease in retinal b-wave responses of the electroretinogram as well as a decrease in the amplitude of the oscillatory potentials mediated by the neural retina.
Although there were no measureable differences between KO and wild type (WT) mice in either pre-synaptic rod calcium channel function or post-synaptic bipolar cell glutamate receptor responses, ultrastructural analysis revealed a marked decrease in the diameter of synaptic vesicles in rod terminals.
Recent quantification suggests that this decrease in synaptic vesicle size due to the absence of VLC-PUFAs in KO mice, and the consequent decrease in glutamate content, could account for the decrease in b-wave response amplitudes that were previously measured in these animals.


Abstract
Basic research and epidemiological studies suggest a protective effect of long-chain omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) against age-related cognitive decline.
However, most randomized controlled trials with LC n-3 PUFA supplements have yielded disappointing results on cognitive outcomes in older persons.
One explanation for this discrepancy may be an inadequate targeting of potential beneficiaries of LC n-3 PUFA according to their Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype.
The aim of this paper was to examine the potential modifying effect of APOE genotype on LC n-3 PUFA metabolism and its relation to cognitive decline in older persons.
At least five epidemiological studies and three intervention studies with LC n-3 PUFA supplements have found an interaction between LC n-3 PUFA and APOE genotype on cognition.
However, the direction of the effect is inconsistent across studies: the impact of LC n-3 PUFA on cognition is stronger in APOE4 carriers (the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease) in some studies, but conversely stronger in APOE4 non-carriers in other studies.
These discordant results may be explained by different age groups, cognitive status, measures of cognition, or amounts of DHA intake across studies.
Experimental studies suggest that the APOE4 genotype modifies the metabolism of DHA.
The APOE genotype should be systematically taken into account and interactions tested in epidemiological and intervention studies with LC n-3 PUFA.
Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of this gene X diet interaction.


Title
Phospholipid, arachidonate and eicosanoid signaling in schizophrenia

Abstract
This paper reviews the potential role of arachidonic acid in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
We discuss how abnormal levels of arachidonic acid may arise, and how dysregulation of signaling molecules derived from it have the potential to disrupt not only dopamine signaling, but numerous other physiological processes associated with the illness.
Pharmacological doses of niacin stimulate the release of arachidonic acid; and arachidonic acid-derived molecules in turn dilate blood vessels in the skin.
A blunted skin flush response to niacin is reliably observed among patients with schizophrenia.
The niacin response abnormality may thus serve as a biomarker to identify a physiological subtype of schizophrenia associated with defective arachidonic acid-derived signaling.


Abstract
The aim of the present investigation is to compare the chemical characterization of four monovarietal virgin olive oils obtained from fruits of olive trees grown in Morocco (Picholine, Picual, Arebiquine, Koroneiki) with kinetic parameters of oxidation based on Rancimat measurements and finally to assess the oxidative stabilities.
The examined oils from different varieties showed a chemical composition within the regulatory limits.
Rancimat measurements of induction times were carried out under isothermal conditions in an air atmosphere at temperatures from 373 to 423 K with intervals of 10 K.
Using the Arrhenius-type correlation between the inverse induction times and the absolute temperature of the measurements, Ea, Z, and k values for oil oxidation under Rancimat conditions were calculated.
The primary kinetic parameters derived from this method were qualitatively consistent and help to evaluate the oxidative stabilities of oils at increased temperatures.


Abstract
The growing demand of bio-sourced products leads to an increasing interest for the development of new resources of raw materials.
In order to generate a higher economic value in the oleoproteaginous sector, meals, co-products of oil extraction present qualities capable of being exploited in a wide range of sectors.
These meals are mainly commercialized in feed application, but remain relatively weak used in the chemistry domain or even in food.
To enlarge these applications, the pre-treatment of the raw material by grinding and air-classification offers technological outlooks for the conception of new extraction processes of interesting components.
The present publication has the following goal: to examine the diversification of oleoproteaginous meal market, out of traditional usage in the chemistry domain; to characterize the meals chemical composition and their techno-functional properties; to evaluate the feasibility of valorizing these meals and their derivatives as substitutes or additives allowing the reduction of the level in petro-chemical product, for example, for the production of adhesive formulations for particle boards.
To achieve this, different actions have been performed: evaluation of the potential and accessible market starting from metropolitan crops; analysis of the panorama of intellectual property for the identified markets; chemical characterization of ground plant meals and their soluble and insoluble fractions; applicability of the different obtained fractions, in terms of foaming power, emulsifier and gelifier; first application tests starting from rapeseed and sunflower meals in the wood panel board domain.
The obtained results have allowed: to draw up a map of the inventive activity bound to the valorization of proteins from rapeseed, sunflower and soy meals and pea flour in various applications, highlighting the dynamism and the growing interest for industrials and academics to use oleo-proteaginous plant proteins; to explore techno-functional properties brought by these plant meals and their derivatives, in particular in the wood panel domain.


Abstract
Sunflower appears as a potentially highly competitive crop, thanks to the diversification of its market and the richness of its oil.
However, seed oil concentration (OC) – a commercial criterion for crushing industry – is subjected to genotypic and environmental effects that make it sometimes hardly predictable.
It is assumed that more understanding of oil physiology combined with the use of crop models should permit to improve prediction and management of grain quality for various end-users.
Main effects of temperature, water, nitrogen, plant density and fungal diseases were reviewed in this paper.
Current generic and specific crop models which simulate oil concentration were found to be empirical and to lack of proper evaluation processes.
Recently two modeling approaches integrating ecophysiological knowledge were developed by Andrianasolo (2014, Statistical and dynamic modelling of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) grain composition as a function of agronomic and environmental factors, Ph.D. Thesis, INP Toulouse): (i) a statistical approach relating OC to a range of explanatory variables (potential OC, temperature, water and nitrogen stress indices, intercepted radiation, plant density) which resulted in prediction quality from 1.9 to 2.5 oil points depending on the nature of the models; (ii) a dynamic approach, based on “source-sink” relationships involving leaves, stems, receptacles (as sources) and hulls, proteins and oil (as sinks) and using priority rules for carbon and nitrogen allocation.
The latter model reproduced dynamic patterns of all source and sink components faithfully, but tended to overestimate OC.
A better description of photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake, as well as genotypic parameters is expected to improve its performance.

Title
Impact of the gut microbiota on the neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress in rodents

Abstract
The gastro-intestinal tract hosts a complex microbial ecosystem, the gut microbiota, whose collective genome coding capacity exceeds that of the host genome.
The modes of action are still to be deciphered.
They may involve transport of neuroactive bacterial metabolites to the brain through the bloodstream, stimulation of the vagus nerve or of entero-endocrine cells, or modulation of the immune system and, consequently, of the inflammatory status.
The discovery that the gut microbiota regulates the neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress paves the way for the hypothesis that gut microbiota dysbioses could contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety-related disorders.
In this regard, treatments of anxiety-prone rodent strains with probiotics or antibiotics aimed at modifying their gut microbiota have shown an anxiolytic-like activity.
Clinical trials are now needed to know if results obtained in preclinical studies can translate to humans.


Abstract
Thus, an elevated DHA status is considered to be important throughout infancy for brain development.
While DHA can be added directly to infant foods, there have been important studies to show that infants can partially meet their own DHA requirements by consuming adequate levels of omega 3 alpha linolenic acid (ALA).
A key requirement to allow for the conversion of ALA to DHA and to maximise its incorporation into tissues is a diet that is also low in omega 6 linoleic acid (LA).
Such diets are hard to find commercially because dietary guidelines dictate that ~3% energy of infant diets should be in the form of LA.
These estimates were based on early animal experiments in which basal diets were devoid of both LA and ALA.
However, recent animal experiments have indicated that the level of LA required to avoid essential fatty acid deficiency is much lower when ALA is also present in the diet.
When a wide range diets are evaluated in animal systems, it is possible to see that the level of DHA found in the blood of animals fed diets containing only LA and ALA can reach levels similar to that of animals fed diets rich in fish oil, but only when the ALA:LA ratio is high and the total amount of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is low.
Diets that are rich in either monounsaturates or saturates meet these requirements.


Title
Les esters méthyliques d’acides gras comme possible thérapie contre l’ischémie cérébrale

Abstract
Saturated fatty acids have been traditionally thought to be detrimental in circulation.
However, we describe the beneficial effects of palmitic and stearic acid methyl esters as it relates to neuroprotection and cerebral vasodilatory properties in global and focal cerebral ischemia.
The methyl esterification of fatty acids is not prominent in nature.
However, it seems to have biological activity related to neuroprotection/vasodilation.
We will discuss the etiology of cerebral ischemia such as stroke and cardiac arrest in terms of current and future treatment modalitiesas it relates to fatty acid-based therapies.
This review is based on the meeting presentation at the “The Journées Chevreul, Lipids & Brain III 2015” in Paris on 16–18 March, 2015.


Abstract
Industrial hemp cultivation surfaces are low compared to major crops (almost 11 000 ha in France for 2014, according to CETIOM), but, as all cultivated crops, a breeding activity is needed.
Since several decades, this activity is conducted in France by a single structure, which is “Fédération Nationale des Producteurs de Chanvre” (FNPC).
This article presents the main current and future breeding criteria.
Finally, breeders begin to work on new purposes such as varieties with easy decortication or broomrape tolerance.


Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been postulated to extend the period of gestation, increase birth weight, enhance neurodevelopment and reduce the risk of allergic disease.
Because of its large sample size and relatively broad inclusion criteria, the DOMInO (DHA to Optimise Mother Infant Outcome) trial offers the opportunity to explore the effect of prenatal DHA supplementation of multiple outcomes.
Overall, the DOMInO trial showed that prenatal DHA supplementation increases the length of gestation, reduces the risk of early preterm and low birth weight, has little or no effect on maternal postpartum depression and early childhood neurodevelopment but reduces the risk of atopic eczema and sensitisation in the first year of life.
The clinical utility of prenatal DHA supplementation of reducing early birth is important and requires further investigation.

The branch of industrial hemp is of low economic dimension, without being in the field of microeconomics.
This sector is very strongly regulated by its national and European structuring.


Abstract
Epidemiological studies have reported that breastfed children have improved psychomotor development compared to never breastfed children.
Human studies suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially long chain PUFA (LC-PUFA) which are highly contained in breast milk, could explain this link, since they are needed for pre- and postnatal brain development.
Our aim was to study the relationships between several measures of pre- and postnatal exposures to PUFA and child’s psychomotor development at 2 and 3 years in the EDEN cohort.
Breastfeeding duration was positively associated with psychomotor development.
From a public health perspective, this work reiterates the need to promote breastfeeding duration, and to monitor the balance of PUFA intake during pregnancy and lactation periods.


Abstract
The role of n-3 PUFAs has gained more importance these last decades, especially in inflammatory processes because they can display anti-inflammatory properties.
Inflammation is a protective response of the body in controlling infection and promoting tissue repair.
However, excessive inflammation can cause local tissue damage.
This is especially the case for the brain for which the functional consequences of neuroinflammation include alterations in cognition, affect and behavior leading to a negative impact on the quality of life and well-being of patients (Dantzer, 2001, 2008).
Hence, limiting the inflammation in the brain is a real strategy for neuroinflammatory disease therapy and treatment.
Recent data show that n-3 PUFAs exert anti-inflammatory properties in part through the synthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators such as resolvins that actively turned off the inflammatory response.
This review first outlines basic concepts of neuroinflammation and the role of n-3 PUFAs in this process and then summarizes the biosynthesis, signaling pathways and role of resolvins.


Title
Oro-sensory perception of dietary lipids and obesity

Abstract
The gustation is a dynamic system able to rapid physiological adaptations in response to on-going environmental changes that characterize our feed (rhythm, quality, quantity).
In humans, a study from our laboratory indicates that obese subjects, in which the oro-sensory detection of lipids is defective, over-consume fatty foods.


Abstract
With the ageing population and increased cases of neurodegenerative diseases, there is a crucial need for the development of new nutritional approaches to prevent and delay the onset of cognitive decline.
Neuroinflammatory processes contribute to neuronal damage that underpins neurodegenerative disorders.


Abstract
We assessed a selection of natural gelling agents of non-animal origin (ι- and κ-carrageenan, gellan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, sodium alginate, tragacanth and xanthan gum) in serum-free medium at 1–4% (w/v) concentration for their suitability as a more natural 3D culture environment for brain-derived cells.
Their biophysical properties (viscosity, texture, transparency, gelling propensity) resemble those of the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Gels provide the neurons with a 3D scaffold to interact with and allow for an increase of the overall cell density compared to classical monolayer 2D culture.
They not only protect neurons in cell culture from shear forces and medium evaporation, but stabilize the microenvironment around them for efficient glial proliferation, tissue-analog neural differentiation and neural communication.
We report on their properties (viscosity, transparency), their ease of handling in a cell culture context and their possible use modalities (cell embedment, as a cell cover or as a cell culture substrate).
Among the selected gels, guar gum and locust bean gum with intercalated laminin allowed for cortical cell embedment.
Neurons plated on and migrating into gellan gum survived and differentiated even without the addition of laminin.
Sodium alginate with laminin was a suitable cell cover.
Finally, we exemplarily demonstrate how guar gum supported the functional survival of a cortical culture over a period of 79 days in a proof-of-concept long-term microelectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology study.


Abstract
It was then possible to compare this intake data to the recommended dietary intake (RDI) of fatty acids defined by Anses in 2010.
Thus it is important to choose the fat you eat.
In September 2015, Anses issued its own report on the fatty acids intakes of the population living in France, and the comparison to the RDI 2010.
Their results are similar to those of Terres Univia.


Title
The versatility of the Moringa oleifera oil in sustainable applications

Abstract
This study had as aims the extraction, purification and characterization of moringa oil for everyday applications with backing scientific.
The average oil yield was of 23.92%, using the techniques: mechanical pressing (11.36%) and by with hexane extraction (35.48%).
The oil extracted by pressing was analysed for gas chromatography, revealing a profile of 21.5% of saturated fatty acids and 78.5% of unsaturated fatty acids, having the oleic acid as the major component.
The mixed crude oil was refined in four steps: degumming, neutralization, washing and drying.
The crude and refined oils were characterised through their acidity index (8.8; 20.5 and 0.2 mgKOH g-1), peroxide index (3.3; 5.4 meqO2 kg-1 and not detected), water content (876.6; 632.0 and 630.2 mg kg-1), turbidity (64.1; 12.6 and 2.1 NTU), specific mass (909.5; 907.2 and 907.0 kg m3), kinematic viscosity (43.6; 39.1 and 41.7 mm2 s-1), high power calorific (39.7; 40. and 39.4 MJ kg-1) and calorific value lower (36.9; 36.9; 37.1 MJ kg-1), and ash content (0.05; 0.05 and 0.007%), respectively.
The results show that moringa is a viable and sustainable plant in the use of its oil as raw material for several industries, especially in the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and biodiesel industry.


Abstract
Sunflower broomrape (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) parasitization on sunflower was first observed at the end of the 19th century and has continued since then jeopardizing sunflower cultivation in many areas of Europe and Asia.
A distinctive characteristic of the O. cumana-sunflower parasitic system is that it is mainly governed by a gene-for-gene interaction.
This determines complete resistance in the host controlled by dominant alleles at a single locus, which facilitates the management of the resistance for hybrid seed production.
Buton the other hand avirulence in the parasite is also controlled by dominant alleles at a single gene.
Monogenic, dominant resistance exerts a strong selection pressure on the parasite that maximizes the probability of overcoming resistance mechanisms in a short period of time.
This has in fact resulted in a number of physiological races that periodically surpass all the available resistance sources.
The spread of populations to new areas and the subsequent hybridization between populations is another mechanism creating genetic diversity in sunflower broomrape and allegedly recombination of avirulences genes.
After more than one century of coexistence, genetic resistance to broomrape in sunflower has to be focused under an integrated approach that considers not only the characterization of resistance mechanisms in the host, but also the genetic and physiological bases of avirulence in the parasite.
From the perspective of genetic resistance in sunflower, most important is not relying only on single dominant genes, but following instead pyramiding strategies.
These should give priority to combining complementary mechanisms of resistance under both qualitative (vertical) and quantitative (horizontal) genetic control.
These aspects are discussed in the paper.


Abstract
Phenolation was used to dimerize/oligomerize cardanol to propose increase functionality of cardanol.

Abstract
Protein rich meal is a valuable co-product of canola/rapeseed oil extraction.
The storage proteins of canola can satisfy many nutritional and functional requirements for food applications.


Abstract
In France, sunflower honey production has decreased since the nineties and professional beekeepers report important honey yield variability between years and locations.
Consequently, melliferous potential of current sunflower cultivars is questioned as it is not part of traits held in breeding programs.
To investigate this question, a 3-years study was conducted on two sites and attractiveness for honeybees of 13 current sunflower cultivars was assessed under natural conditions.
The number of honeybee visits per plant was recorded daily during blooming period on cultivars randomly distributed on experimental plots.
Sunflower genetic was a major factor influencing honeybee attendance on plots and discrepancy between most and least visited cultivars reached a factor of 3.
Cultivars relative attractiveness was consistent between years and sites.
Potential link between sunflower attractiveness for honeybees and its melliferous characteristics is discussed.
If confirmed, farmers’ choice concerning cultivars at a territory scale could contribute to enhance nectar resource for pollinators and to increase viability of apicultural activity.


Title
Sélection du tournesol : tour d’horizon de 50 années d’évolution

Abstract
This article discusses changes in sunflower breeding objectives since the introduction of hybrid varieties 50 years ago.
After a reminder of the importance of some early programmes, Canadian in particular, the present situation for each breeding objective is compared with those encountered earlier.
Advances in genomics will change breeding procedures, but with rapidly changing molecular techniques, international collaboration is particularly important.


Abstract
Sunflower oil is well known because of its diversity of fatty acids profiles which allow different uses (food: dressing salads, margarines; nonfood: agrofuel, lubricants).
Besides, crude oil contains high amounts of desirable minor components (tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols, phospholipids...) that present important nutritional features with a positive impact on human health.
The different steps of the refining process have as main objective to remove contaminants and other compounds that could hamper the continuity of the process or alter oil during storage.
An indirect consequence of this treatment used to preserve food safety is that micronutriments of interest are also partially eliminated reducing the nutritional quality of the oil.
This review describes in the first part the chemical composition of sunflower oil focusing on desirable and undesirable components.
In the second part the refining process is detailed following the losses of micronutriments at each step of the process and the elimination of unwanted compounds.


Abstract
Camelina has emerged in the last decade as a multipurpose crop plant particularly suitable for engineering new lipids for diverse uses, including feed, biofuel and green chemistry.
The rebirth of this ancient crop was based on several intrinsic favorable characteristics: robust agronomic qualities, attractive oil profile, genetic proximity with the model plant arabidopsis, ease of genetic transformation by floral dip.
The need to increase both the production and diversity of plant oils, while improving the sustainability of agricultural systems, has been the driving forces behind the ever-increasing investment in camelina research.
Worldwide interest in engineering camelina has led to the development of a remarkable pipeline that allows the rapid production and phenotyping of new lines; it includes specific tools, such as databases, collections of natural accessions, methods of genetic transformation and lipid analysis.
Implementation of numerous metabolic pathways in camelina for the production of novel lipids has highlighted the potential as well as the versatility of this new "old" oilseed crop that is well on the way to becoming an ideal plant chassis for lipid synthetic biology.


Title
Émulsions lipidiques alimentaires et endotoxémie

Abstract
The low-grade inflammation observed in obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance.
Among factors triggering such inflammation, recent works revealed the role of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), so-called endotoxins.
LPS are naturally present in the gut via the intestinal microbiota.
Recent studies show that they can induce in plasma a metabolic endotoxemia after the consumption of unbalanced hyperlipidic meals.
Notably, lipids are present in foods under various physicochemical structures and notably in emulsified form.


Abstract
Mainly composed of triglycerides and their fatty acids, vegetable oils also contain between 1 and 5% of micronutrients such as tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols and coenzymes Q.
Naturally present in rape, soya and sunflower seeds, these compounds are known for their benefits to health.
Their transfer and their preservation from seed to oil appear as essential.
However, much of these micronutrients are partially to totally destroyed during crushing and refining processes.
Seed preparation (rolling, grinding, cooking), solvent extraction and purification of oils (neutralization, bleaching and deodorization) are, indeed, all steps that have a significant influence on levels of minor components of crude and refined oils.
Work to demonstrate the efficiency of different alternative methods have then been conducted.


Abstract
An efficient protocol for the self-metathesis of oleic acid, using ruthenium catalysts is described.
The self-metathesis reaction under ultrasonic activation allows the conversion of monoenic fatty acids such as oleic acid, elaidic acid and erucic acid into diacids and olefins with very short reaction times in the presence of Grubbs ruthenium catalysts.
These yields and selectivity towards the desired products are influenced by the nature of solvents.


Abstract
Biorefinery of sunflower whole plant was performed successfully using a thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor.
Firstly, the hydrophilic phase will be recycled to the process.
Thirdly, the upper hydrophobic phase will be usable for the waterproofing treatment of the surface of agromaterials by coating.
Positioned in walls and ceilings, boards with medium and low density will contribute to the heat insulation of buildings.
As proposed, this flow chart thus allows a valorization for all fractions originating from the twin-screw reactor.


Abstract
We investigated the effects of several crop management parameters on the fatty-acid composition of very high-oleic (VHO) and a very high-linoleic (VHL) sunflower cultivar.
Experiments were performed on these varieties grown on field plots in 2009 and 2010.
Yield and fatty-acid composition were determined and the effect of irrigation was investigated at the flowering stage in VHL cultivars.
We also evaluated the effects of three sowing dates studied on Antonil, a VHL cultivar.
Yield and fatty-acid content were similar in 2009 and 2010.
The best results were obtained for PR65H22 (a hybrid cultivar), for which a mean oleic acid content of 93% was obtained in 2009.
For the VHL variety, yields were higher for plots irrigated at flowering.
Late sowing was associated with higher linoleic acid content, and irrigation at flowering resulted in higher yields and linoleic contents.
These results highlight the effects of different types of technical management on the yield and quality of this crop.


Title
Market trend in France on the presence of plant proteins in food products

Abstract
The current context is propitious to the development of plant proteins use for food: health and environmental considerations, expansion of flexitarism and to a lesser extent of vegetarianism, addition of research on plant proteins to the strategic research agenda in France...
EPV, French association for the promotion of plant protein in foods, reiterated an analysis referencing in France the plant proteins in food products.
It shows a significant and continuous increase of the use of plant proteins in each type of food sections, for many years now.
Wheat remains the first source of plant protein used, followed by soybean proteins.
Specific uses of plant proteins appear in different food categories:
for instance soy and pea proteins are mainly used for meat based products, whereas wheat and fava bean are especially present in bakery wares.
New protein sources are emerging and will be also monitored by GEPV, as microalgae and mycoproteins.


Abstract
In a context of dwindling oil reserves and environmental pressures, the chemical industry needs to innovate by developing new processes for producing bioproducts from raw plant materials.
Unsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils constitute a highly promising renewable resource that can be used to diversify productions, decreasing reliance on petroleum.
A starting material rich in oleic acid has been obtained through the selection of high-oleic sunflower varieties and enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil they produce.
The double bonds of this unsaturated raw material have been cleaved in green oxidizing conditions involving a biphasic lipophilic-aqueous system including hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and a peroxo-tungsten complex Q3 {PO2[WO(O2)2]4} as a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC) and co-oxidant.
This PTC efficiently transferred oxygen to the substrate in the lipophilic phase.
A mono-acid (pelargonic acid) and a di-acid (azelaic acid), with shorter, unusual hydrocarbon chains not present in the natural state, were synthesized and purified through an intensive process.
Pelargonic acid was then formulated as an environmentally friendly biocontrol agent for weeds.
We extended this green process of oxidative scission to other fatty acids and derivatives, to obtain other short-chain acids with diverse potential applications.
This production chain (crops, reaction and purification processes, products, applications) is based on a sustainable development strategy.


Title
Fats and eating behaviour in children

Abstract
This paper analyses the place of fats in young children’s diet.
Firstly, it shows on the one hand the important contribution that fats should have to total dietary intake of children younger than 2 years, because of their interest for neural development and their putative protective effect against the further developement of obesity ;
on the other hand it underlines the low contribution of fats to total dietary intakes in French children, according to the available data, with a minority of children with adequate fat intake.
In newborns and infants, some works have looked at preference for fats and indicate the absence of a fat preference.
Perspectives for future research are discussed.


Abstract
The 107th AOCS Annual Meeting and Expo held in Salt Lake City (Utah, USA) from 1st to 4th May 2016.
As usual, this congress overviewed research in areas about lipids with up to 11 technical sessions in parallel.
The aim of this article is not to provide a comprehensive account but to present the remarkable advancements within the sessions.


Abstract
Social, economic and environmental importance of bio-based economy is rapidly growing and vegetable oils play an important role.
About 75% of global production of vegetable oils derives from commodity oilseeds (i.e., soybean, oil palm, rapeseed), while the remaining 25% is produced from minor oilseeds characterized by unusual fatty acid composition.
The present review aims at analyzing the potentialities of two alternative oilseed crops for Europe, camelina (Camelina sativa) and crambe (Crambe abyssinica), identified as major candidates for the future European bio-based economy as testified by the recently funded EU Project (Horizon 2020) COSMOS (Camelina and crambe Oil crops as Sources of Medium-chain Oils for Specialty oleochemicals).
The interest on camelina and crambe is mainly due to their unique fatty acid profile, low input management and wide environmental adaptability.
We attempted to analyze pros and cons of development of camelina and crambe in Europe in the light of biorefinery concept (i.e., using oil and whole produced biomass) as undertaken by COSMOS project.


Title
Review of the cotton market in Pakistan and its future prospects

Abstract
Pakistan is the world’s 4th largest producer of cotton.
Cultivation along the Indus River extends across nearly 3 million hectares and serves as the backbone of the economy.
Despite this importance, information on the cotton sector in Pakistan, in particular with regard to cotton oils, is scanty and not available from a single source.
This review seeks to remedy that gap.
Pakistan fulfills 17.7% of its demand for edible oils through cottonseed oil.
Total demand for this purpose in 2029–30 is estimated at 5.36 million tons of which local production will be 1.98 million tons.

Abstract
Climate change is characterized by higher temperatures, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, extreme climatic hazards, and less water available for agriculture.
Sunflower, a spring-sown crop often cultivated in southern and eastern regions of Europe, could be more vulnerable to the direct effect of heat stress at anthesis and drought during its growing cycle, both factors resulting in severe yield loss, oil content decrease, and fatty acid alterations.
Sunflower crop models should be revised to account for these emerging environmental factors in order to reduce the uncertainties in yield and oil predictions.


Abstract
Today, 4 French people out of 10 eat soyfoods.
Consumers have adopted them in their diet, without changing their habits, because they consider them natural and healthy.
The consumption is relatively new and is expected to grow in the coming years.
Soyfoods produced from soybeans provide high quality proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, fibres, vitamins and minerals.
Soybeans contain isoflavones, much of which is lost during the production of soyfoods, which contain between 1 and 3 mg per g protein.
The current consumption of soyfoods is largely consistent with the maximum intake of 1 mg/kg/day recommended by the Afssa in 2005.
Infant development with formulas based on soy protein is similar to that observed with those based on cow milk or with breast milk, on all studied parameters (growth, bone health and metabolic, reproductive, endocrine, immune and neurological functions).
Soyfoods may have a protective effect against the risk for breast cancer (probably due to isoflavones), particularly if the consumption starts early, before adolescence.
In women with breast cancer history, soyfoods can be integrated in the diet.
Introduce soyfoods in the diet also helps to maintain cardiovascular health, because of their favorable effect on LDL-cholesterol, endothelial function and potentially on blood pressure.


Abstract
This study assessed the winter frost damage evolution along from 1961 to 2015 in Burgundy-Franche-Comté by using: (1) daily observed and gridded regional temperature data and (2) a validated crop winter frost stress model calibrated for pea.
This study shows a global decrease of the frost stress nevertheless resulting from a subtle balance between the decrease in its intensity and the increase of the number of events.
The frost stress evolution patterns with warming depend on both plant frost resistance level and acclimation rate and are still sensitive to winter climate fluctuations.
This study provides relevant information for breeding performant winter crop ideotypes able to moderate detrimental effects of climate change and offering new cropping opportunities in temperate regions.


Title
Lipid matrix and bioavailability of alpha-linolenic acid

Abstract
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of omega-3 series (ω3) have an important role in preventing certain diseases.
Besides being necessary in specific physiological conditions (pre- and post-natal development, growth) (Riediger et al., 2009.
J Am Diet Assoc 109: 668–679.), they are associated with health effects in terms of prevention, especially for cardiovascular disease, inflammation, some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (De Lorgeril et al., 1994.
Lancet 343: 1454–1459; Simopoulos, 2008.
Exp Biol Med (Maywood, NJ) 233: 674–688).
However, recent epidemiological studies show that the PUFA ω3 intake, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the metabolic precursor of long chain PUFA ω3, are three times lower than the French recommendations (ANSES, 2011).
Besides the need to increase the ALA intake, it is now necessary to take into account the factors that improve its bioavailability.
In this context, we tested several parameters that modulate the metabolic fate of ALA.
Our research has demonstrated that several physical and chemical parameters, such as the emulsification of linolenic oil with soybean lecithin, the position of ALA on the glycerol backbone of the triglyceride but also the composition of the lipid matrix would modulate the bioavailability and the metabolic fate of ALA in the organism.

Title
Olive oil: an overview of the Japanese market

Abstract
The article presents an overview of olive oil consumption in Japan, Asia’s largest per capita consumer and at present 14th in the world.
Since the early 1990s, total purchases have increased from 4943 t in the 1992/93 campaign to 61 903 t in 2014/15, a more than 12-fold increase over the space of 22 years.
Other key factors to be considered are economic and cultural.
This openness, allied to the country’s relative affluence, is demonstrated in the consumption of olive oil, a pillar of the Mediterranean Diet.


Title
Certification, labelling and traceability of palm oil: can we build confidence from trustworthy standards?

Abstract
The present article is aimed at presenting various types of certification standards which are presently – or could be – applied to the production of palm oil.
Doing so, it provides an overview of the existing mechanisms under way both at the European and global level and it addresses the controversial issue of reliance and accuracy of certification standards.
The RSPO certification scheme provides an interesting example of such controversies.
The case of palm oil reflects the recurring issue of mandatory vs. voluntary standards and the underlying question of the respective role of public vs. private stakeholders in the designing and further implementation of such standards.
The high number of standards, appellations or labels creates some – understandable – confusion amongst consumers and deciders and this point is of paramount importance if confidence is on the agenda.
The authors conclude on the urgent need for collaborative and multidisciplinary research in order to provide certification standards with science-based evidence and thus strengthen their reliability.
The success of a certification scheme depends also greatly on the ability of stakeholders to gain a premium price to offset the incurred costs.


Title
Soybean in China: adaptating to the liberalization

Abstract
Since 1978 and its opening, China has undergone a process of nutrition transition, animal products taking an increasing share.
Anxious to ensure a certain level of food independence, Chinese authorities have developed national livestock production.
The increase in volumes and the development of large scale breeding have increased the demand for commercial feed and thus soymeal.
Meanwhile, edible oil consumption rose sharply, accentuating the demand for soybeans.
To meet this demand, soybean imports were liberalized early, leading the country to become heavily dependent.
China has indeed made the choice to maintain its independence in cereals at the expense of other grains, such as soybeans.
Competition between corn and soybeans has turned in favor of the cereal, soybean production levelling off then regressing.
China’s dependence extends to the crushing sector, controlled by foreign companies.
Public supports in place, such as minimum prices, have resulted in increasing the price gap with imported products, leading to a reform of soybean policy in 2014.


Title
Colza en Chine

Abstract
In 2015, China was the world’s second most important producer of rapeseed after Canada, with 7.59 million hectares under cultivation and a production of 14.1 million tons.
It is also a major importer of rapeseed grain, as well as the premier consumer.
Currently, its R&D remains mainly public.


Title
State and trends of oil crops production in China

Abstract
This paper attempts to present a full picture of current situation and future trends of Chinese oil crop production.
The total oil crop production remained broadly constant during 2011–2014.
The top three oil crops are soybean, peanut and rapeseed, together accounting for more than 70% of total oil crop production.
The area under cultivation and the production of peanuts will keep steadily increasing because most Chinese like its pleasant roasted flavor.
Because of their high content in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the natural minor functional components in their oils, more attention is being paid to sunflower seed and rice bran.
The diminishing availability of arable land and concern over the security of edible oil supplies is driving both a change in cultivation structure of crops and improvements in the efficiency of oilseed production in China.


Abstract
This is why this article will also suggest some tracks of reflection for the research and expert’s communities, who would like to support this expansion, thus contributing to the future of the millions of small coconut farmers.


Abstract
This paper reviews the potential and barriers of demand-side mitigation options in the agricultural sector based on the recent academic literature and on a survey conducted on a sample of 788 respondents living in France.
The mitigation potential of such measures as reducing losses in the food supply chain and shifting diets toward less animal products is estimated to be particularly high, higher, in particular, than supply-side mitigation options.
However, to ensure that these measures do not entail a reduction in protein intake, these estimations should consider both caloric and protein units, and take into account the digestibility differentials between protein sources.
Our survey shows that people are relatively reluctant to eat more sustainably, preferring to reduce their emissions in other areas such as housing or equipment.
This relative reluctance is mainly due to individual perceptions linked to health concerns, taste or habits.
Some obstacles could easily be overcome through well-designed policies aiming to, for example, advertise a lower consumption of red meat for health benefits.
National governments are, however, rather inactive on this topic, leaving the initiative to the civil society.


Abstract
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 ω-3) is highly enriched in the brain and is required for proper brain development and function.
Its deficiency has been shown to be linked with the emergence of neurological diseases.
Dietary ω-3 fatty acid supplements including DHA have been suggested to improve neuronal development and enhance cognitive functions.
Findings suggested that DHA is better incorporated into the brain when esterified at the sn-2 position of a lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-DHA).
AceDoPC® is a structured phospholipid or acetyl-LysoPC-DHA.
As previously shown for LysoPC-DHA, AceDoPC® is a specific and preferred carrier of DHA to the brain.
When AceDoPC® was injected to rats that were subjected to an ischemic stroke, it prevents the extension of brain lesions.
Regarding the essential role of DHA for cerebral functions, targeting the brain with specific carriers of DHA might provide novel therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases.


Title
Climate change, a research challenge: the example of the 4‰ hypothesis

Abstract
Agriculture is probably the most climate-dependent human activity and is both victim and responsible for climate change, while it can also be a solution to the climate change crisis.
It is in developing countries, particularly in vulnerable ones, that the effects of climate change will be most violent.
Agriculture emits greenhouse gases but it is possible to reduce these emissions by agroecological practices, favoring the increase of organic matter in the soil.
It is also possible, through these practices, to increase atmospheric carbon capture by fixing carbon in the soil and thus contribute to mitigating climate change while improving soil properties, thereby simultaneously improving the adaptation of agriculture to climate change.
An increase in carbon content of all the world's soils of 4‰ per year would offset all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
The French international initiative “4‰, Soils for Food Security and Climate” aims to implement projects to show that it is possible to increase the carbon content of the soil in these proportions and to answer the research questions that this poses, in particular as regards measurement of the carbon content in the soil, relevant agronomic practices, the enabling socioeconomic context to this approach and finally the monitoring over time of the induced changes.


Abstract
A better adaptation of sowing dates, an improvement of lodging resistance and a limitation of the sowing density can limit the development of ascochyta blight for winter pea crops.
For spring pea, an increased use of Aphanomyces soil test could avoid to sow the crop in infested fields.
National and European projects are in course to breed new varieties more adapted to different stresses.

Breeding the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) for climate change

Abstract
Breeding the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) for climate change requires multidisciplinary and collaborative research by nature:
Molecular approaches and tools have great potential to optimize patterns of plant breeding, especially for perennial species.
Consequently the availability and sharing of such a large amount of data is currently reshaping most of oil palm breeding strategies.


Title
Pleomorphic adenoma of minor salivary gland

Objective
Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) is the most common benign neoplasm of the minor salivary glands.
A retrospective epidemiologic, clinical and therapeutic analysis is conducted.

Results
There were 1 man and 6 women having a mean age of 36,85 years.

Conclusion
Pleomorphic adenoma of minor salivary gland is generally known to be a slowgrowing tumour.
They must be evoked for each tumor developed under a healthy oral mucosa.
The surgical management is basically total resection of the tumor with a safety margin of 5 mm.
Longer follow-up was needed due to the possibility of recurrences and malignancy transformation.


Title
Medical emergencies in dental practice

Results
1344 were included.

Conclusions
Dental practitioners encounter medical emergencies, mostly benign ones but also, more rarely, life-threatening emergencies.
Efforts should be made in the education of dental practitioners regarding the management of medical emergencies during initial and continuing education.
The recommended emergency equipment for dental practices should be kept to the minimum necessary in order to increase the number of offices properly equipped.


Introduction
We report a case of bilateral ischemic necrosis of the tongue following transoral neurosurgical procedure.

Observation
A Davis-Boyle mouth gag was used for tumor exposition and the operation lasted 8 h.
However, the edema increased and necrosis of the tongue appeared 72 h after the surgery.
The patient underwent tracheotomy and the necrotic tissue was removed.
More than 15 days passed before glossal engorgement resolved.

Discussion
The etiology of tongue necrosis is likely related to tissue ischemia, secondary to venous or arterial obstruction.
Prolonged use of the Davis-Boyle mouth gag may incur greater risk of ischemic necrosis of the tongue.


Title
Rare zoster involvement of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the trigeminal nerve

Introduction
Herpes zoster or shingles is secondary to reactivation of the virus Varicella Zona (VZV) remaining latent in the nerve ganglia.
The facial involvement usually includes the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.
The elderly are more vulnerable to this disease, and especially its complications.

Clinical case
A 75-year-old patient consulted for infl ammatory and painful swelling involving the right cheek.
Because of the metameric mapping, the mucocutaneous involvement and the lack of tooth infection, the diagnosis of herpes zoster of the 2nd and 3rd branches of the trigeminal nerve was made.
The outcome was favorable under treatment.
Tooth exfoliation came two weeks after the healing.

Discussion
The simultaneous herpetic involvement of the last two branches of the trigeminal nerve has rarely been reported in the literature.
This location is accompanied by mucosal involvement and dental complications.
The classic blistering rash of shingles may be lacking in the elderly.
Early diagnosis is crucial to avoid debilitating nerve complications such as post-herpetic neuralgia.


Title
Historical ameloblastoma of the mandible.

Introduction
Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor characterized by its local aggressiveness, reaching the mandible most often.
The diagnosis is usually made before the occurrence of a mandibular swelling.
Its treatment requires surgical excision and regular monitoring because of the risk of recurrence.
We report a case history of a giant mandibular ameloblastoma diagnosed at a late stage, complicating the management and reconstruction.

Discussion-Conclusion
A giant form of ameloblastoma is a major therapeutic problem, as they require complete resection of the mandible, engaging the functional and aesthetic prognosis.
The presentation of this giant case of ameloblastoma reminds us of the difficulties of access to care and monitoring for patients in developing countries.


Introduction
Odontoma growing in the extraosseous soft tissue is very rare.

Observation
A case of peripheral odontoma arising in the mouth floor of a 1 yearold girl is reported.

Discussion
Extraosseous odontoma are rarely observed.

Conclusion
This case of peripheral odontoma occurring in the mouth floor is the first reported in the literature to our knowledge.
Possible explanations regarding its origin lie in embryological assumptions


Title
Diagnosis of syphilis and HIV from oral ulcers

Introduction
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection linked to Treponema pallidum.
The disease had declined from the mid-20th century with the development of penicillin therapy.
Since the early 2000s, cases have again been reported in France and around the world.

Observation
We report in a Crohn’s disease context a case of primary syphilis manifested by mouth ulcers.
The diagnosis revealed infection associated with HIV.


Observation
A thirty-year-old patient without sexual oro-genital activities consulted for whitish millimeter-length lesions localized in the hard palate and the left labial corners which had appeared a year ago.
The surgical excision of both lesions of the hard palate were performed, as well as a biopsy of the left labial commissure, completed by electrocoagulation.
The histological exam concluded the diagnosis of condyloma acuminata.
No recurrence was recorded during the ten months of post-operative follow-up.

Discussion
Oral lesions of condyloma acuminatum are very seldom and often secondary to contamination through direct sexual contact.
Meanwhile, other transmission pathways not related to direct sexual contact are described.
The diagnosis of condyloma acuminatum is clinical and confirmed by a histological exam.
Radical treatment based mainly on surgical excision or electrocoagulation is imperative because of the high ly contagious character of this lesion.

Conclusion
Condyloma acuminatum is very seldom localized in the oral cavity.


Title
Rare oral metastasis from a probable large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung

Observation
We reported the case of gingival hyperplasia around an upper molar in a patient with a medical history of lung adenocarcinoma treated by targeted chemotherapy.
Incisional biopsy of the intraoral lesion revealed a large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC).
New imaging assessment revealed multiple metastasis locations of the lung disease.
This case made us question the link between gingival LCNEC and the lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed through pleural cytology.
Review of cytology findings did not make it possible to identify a neuroendocrine component among adenocarcinoma cells.
Immunohistochemical tools sometimes help to differentiate primary from secondary lesions, but this was inconclusive here.

Discussion
The literature shows that in cases of lung composite carcinoma, one component may be absent on small histology samples, and therefore on cytology.
It was not possible either to rule out neuroendocrine carcinoma development under the effect of targeted chemotherapy.
We considered the diagnosis of intraoral metastasis of a composite lung carcinoma which metastasized to its neuroendocrine component in the oral cavity.


Title
Oral manifestations of erythema multiforme: case reports

Introduction
The major form presents with cutaneous and mucous (oral and/or genital) lesions and general symptoms.

Conclusion
The diagnosis of EM should be considered for recurrent oral ulcers associated with other mucous membranes.
Target lesions on the skin are characteristic of EM.


Title
Mandibular metastasis revealing a vesicular thyroid carcinoma: a case report

Observation
We report the case of a patient aged 40 who had a right mandibular mass radiologically mimicking an odontogenic tumor.
Pathological examination of the surgical resection specimen revealed mandibular metastasis of a vesicular thyroid carcinoma that was previously undiagnosed.

Discussion
Extrathyroid extension of a vesicular carcinoma, even invasive, is rare and appears late.
It is mainly intravenous, with two preferential metastatic sites: the lung and bone.
This metastatic risk is almost exclusive to angioinvasive vesicular carcinoma.
Although rare, mandibular metastasis revealing vesicular thyroid carcinoma must be kept in mind.


Introduction
Idiopathic burning mouth syndrome (iBMS) is a chronic oral pain syndrome mainly characterized by a burning sensation in the oral mucosa and an etiopathogenesis that remains unclear, with therapeutic options that are disappointing.
Any clinical observation providing insight into the disorder can therefore be of interest.
Among metabolic factors, deficiencies of vitamins have been pointed out, but only a few studies have focused on the role of vitamin B6 (vitB6) in this syndrome.
In this report, we aimed to highlight the involvement of increased but not decreased vitB6 serum levels in a subgroup of BMS Patients.

Patients and Methods
Medical files of patients who attended the chronic orofacial pain consultation, in the dental departement of the Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière (GHPS) in Paris (France) between 09/03/2008 and 12/19/2015 were retrieved from the hospital database and analyzed.

Results
There was a statistically significant correlation between pain and vitB6 levels.

Material and method
Results According to the results of statistical study, 84.6% of Moroccans patient have a good picture of the doctor dentist.
The results revealed that the quality of human relation (behavior of the doctor 69% and his communication with the patient 64% ) is the most decisive criteria of the “good” dentist, followed by the context of job 68.8%.
The fee comes then which represent 23.5%, as well as hygiene and sterilization with 16%.
Finally the personality of a dentist and the presentation of the office présent 6.5% the perception of a “good” dentist.


Results
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA:
63.30% were men.
The average age is 25 years.
PERCEPTION OF SMILING:
63.30% find the color of their normal teeth.


Material and Methods
The study consisted of a total of 220 subjects ranged from 15 to 64 years.
Occlusal contacts were examined during lateral excursions from the maximal intercuspal position to the canine to canine position.
The subjects’ occlusal schemes were classified as canine protected occlusion, group function, balanced occlusion or unclassified.
In addition, the presence of occlusal interferences during mandibular excursions was recorded.
Statistical tests were used with level of significance at P = 0.5.

Conclusion
The most common occlusal scheme was group function.


Title
Pulp stones and their impact on the quality of endodontic treatment: radiographic study

Results
Pulp stones were found in 39.6% of examined teeth.
Molars were the most affected teeth (57.63%), followed by decayed teeth (49.16%) and finally teeth with both a carious lesion and coronal restoration or with carious lesion combined to periodontal disease.
Technical quality of endodontic treatment was considered inadequate in 35.6% of teeth with pulp stones.

Hyper specialized breeds: between lock-in and local. The example of the Belgian Texel breed


Title
The standard surgical treatment is not always possible for the extended forms.
Medical treatment is controversial.
After the first two treatments, a significant partial remission of the lesions was observed.
Treatment with two new cures was performed and completed by the surgical removal of a persistent labial lesion.
The regimen is empirical and needs to be evaluated.


Title
Epidemiology of facial fractures: an analysis of 349 patients
The peak of frequency (58.2%) was recorded between 20 and 39 years and the male to female ratio was 7.1:1.
The aetiologies of the fractures were road traffic crashes (80.5%), assaults (9.7%), falls (8.3%), and sport accidents (1.5%).
In 80% of the road traffic accidents, a two-wheeled vehicle was involved and 75.9% of falls were from a tree height.


Title
Granulomatous cheilitis of Miescher: diagnostic difficulty
The etiological diagnosis was refused by the patient.
Treatment with intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg was done successfully.
The etiological diagnosis is essential.
Treatment is reported as a challenge.


Results
Two-wheel motor vehicle collisions were by far the main aetiology.
Cranial injuries and limb fractures were the most common associated injuries.
The injury severity score (ISS) ranged between 5 and 75 (mean 11.1, SD 8.3).
Severe injury, defined as ISS above 15, was recorded in 13.6% of the patients.
Death was recorded in two patients, giving a mortality rate of 1.8%.
There was a statistically significant association between the ISS and multiple facial fractures (p = 0.001).


Introduction
Rendu-Osler syndrome (ROS) is a development disorder of the vasculature transmitted in an autosomic dominant mode.
The average incidence is 1 in 5000 people.
The diagnosis is based on skin and mucosal telangiectasia, nose bleeds, visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and a familial history.

Discussion
ROS has many clinical forms.
Early detection is essential to detect arteriovenous malformations (AVM).
AVM may have many complications, depending on their size and location.
The treatment of ROS is directly dependent on the treatment of AMV.
Angiogenetic modulating molecules are a future therapeutic option.

Title
Manducatory apparatus myofascial pain and dysfunction and connected cervical spine and tongue dysfunction (3rd part)


Introduction
The oral mucosa is involved in 80% of patients with chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD).


Introduction
For this reason, the dentist is sometimes consulted first.

Observation
A female patient, 37 years old, consulted at the dental emergency unit for spontaneous gingival bleeding and intraoral mucosal lesions.
Clinical examination revealed mucocutaneous hemorrhagic syndrome with widespread bruising on the inner side of the right cheek.
The blood count carried out in the emergency unit showed severe thrombocytopenia at 4G/L associated with normocytic anemia.
The final diagnosis was immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
A treatment based on prednisolone 1mg/kg daily and IV immunoglobulin infusion (Tégéline®) allowed complete resolution of the symptoms and normalization of the platelet count.


Observation
We report the case of a PLGA of the upper lip.


Discussion
and literature review:
The diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis should be considered in trismus associated with myalgia.
The correct diagnosis of this disease allows appropriate management, but recurrences are still possible.

Palatal compound melanocytic nevus in a 3-year-old boy

Discussion
OMN and oral malignant melanoma (OMM) are localized preferentially to the palate and have a similar clinical appearance.
This is a histological diagnosis.
The potential malignant transformation of OMN has never been determined.


Discussion
This protocol appears at least as effective as those found in the literature.
The main types of complications were pain, allergic reactions and infections.
Overall, patients are satisfied with this support.
Pluridisciplinary collaboration remains the most important thing for good management.


Title
rare location of a glomus tumor in the soft palate

Discussion
A glomus tumor is a benign tumor of soft tissue usually localized on the nail and the palmar surface of the distal phalange.
This rare palatal localization involves a discussion of other clinical diagnoses.
Radiology is of diagnostic help.
Diagnosis is anatomopathological and treatment is surgical, consisting of a wide excision, avoiding recurrences, which are very rare.


Discussion
This is an unusual case of tetanus.


Title
Molluscum contagiosum of the oral mucosa: case reportand literature review

Discussion
The clinical features differ between immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients.


Introduction
Ulceration of the oral mucosa may be due to a local cause but could also be the manifestation of systemic pathologies or their treatment.
Infectious, dermatological, hematological, nutritional or malignant diseases and some medications can cause mouth ulcers, with acute or chronic evolution.
Many drugs can lead to oral ulcerations, associated or not with skin and/or other mucous lesions.

Discussion
In the presence of mucosal ulceration, the medical history and clinical examination provide diagnostic guidelines.
Additional tests allow the diagnosis of drug-induced ulceration after the exclusion of other possible etiologies.
The diagnostic approach can be difficult, especially in patients suffering from several diseases for which they are polymedicated.


Title
Wilson’s disease: case report and literature review


Discussion
The extra-oral surgical approach for dental extraction is very rare and in most cases the classical intra-oral approach dominates.
However, when intra-oral surgery of the pterygo-maxillary fossa is impossible by the conventional endobuccal method, appropriate extra-oral approaches might be useful.


Introduction
The peripheral taste sensitivity is transmitted to the brain stem by the facial nerve, via the chorda tympani, and by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.
The trigeminal nerve is also involved in the sensory analysis of food.
The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis of a modulation of taste perception by sensory afferents from the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) in humans, by measuring electrogustometricdetection thresholds (EGM) before and after anesthesia of trigeminal afferents.

Material and methods
A group A (n = 60) submitted to regional anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and a control group (n = 60) submitted to anesthesia of the maxillary nerve were compared before (stage 0) and after (stage 1) anesthesia.
EGMrecordings were performed by an examiner single blinded to the anesthesia procedure, at 9 symmetrical lingual tongue loci: tip lateral (Tr, Tl) and central (T), median dorsal (Dr, Dl), posterior lateral edges (Er, El) and posterior dorsal (Pr, Pl).
The correlation between the type of anesthesia and the EGM thresholds was calculated using the Spearman rho test and the intra- and intergroup comparisons, using Mann-Whitney tests and Wilcoxon, with a level of significance set at 0.05.


Title
Bilateral hyperplasia of the coronoid processes (Langenbeck’s disease): a case report

Observation
A histologic exam of the resected samples confirmed the diagnosis of bone hyper- plasia.


Observation
Besides several symptoms (orofacial pain, asthenia, anorexia), clinical abnormalities of the right temporal artery evoked the diagnosis of GCA.
She had been sent quickly to the rheumatology service for confirmation of the diagnosis and special care.


Conclusion
Acellular collagen sponges must be used as a local haemostatic agent.


Methods
The study used 19 rapeseed lots grown in two areas of contrasted agronomical potential harvested in 2011.
Pure fractions of hulls and germs were mechanically separated by centrifuge impacts after freezing the seeds.
Chemical composition of the whole seeds and the pure kernel and hull fractions was determined.
The results were used to calculate the seed hull content.

Results
Hull accounted for 18.2% of total seed content.
Real oil content of the hulls (8.4% dry basis) was lower than in the literature.
Hulls contained 2.9% of the oil, 11.2% of the proteins, 73% of the NDF; 80% of the ADF, 95% of the lignin and 6.0% of the glucosinolates of the whole seed.
