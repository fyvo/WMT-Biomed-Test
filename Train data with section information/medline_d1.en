Abstract
For full HIV virological suppression, three fully active antiretroviral agents are required.
New drug classes should be included to ensure that agents are fully active.
Both viral load and CD4 count responded favourably to this regimen.
The patient received support from physicians and clinic staff in the introduction and use of enfuvirtide.
To reduce injection site reactions, a needle-free injection system (Biojector) proved effective.


Abstract
Management of the HIV patient with treatment experience continues to improve and evolve.
New guidelines suggest that the goal of therapy should be maximal virological suppression.
The cases discussed demonstrate how the use of a potent regimen as salvage therapy can have good clinical, immunological and virological outcomes.
However, if the salvage regimen selected is not potent enough to achieve these goals, the durability of the response is limited.
The key lesson is that these strategies should be built on potency and agents should not be held back in case the strategy fails.


Abstract
Side effects can limit the options available to physicians for the treatment of HIV infection.
Management of these side effects is essential, to avoid cessation of treatment.


Abstract
Early treatment can help prevent end-organ damage associated with HIV replication and can decrease infectivity.
The mainstay of treatment is either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in combination with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
While effective at combating HIV, ART can produce adverse alterations of lipid parameters, with some studies suggesting a relationship between some anti-retroviral agents and cardiovascular disease.
As the HIV-positive population ages, issues such as hypertension and diabetes must be taken into account when initiating ART.
Reducing the pill burden through the use of fixed-dose antiretroviral drug combinations can facilitate adherence.


Abstract
Metrics for quantifying antimicrobial use in beef feedlots.
Accurate antimicrobial drug use data are needed to enlighten discussions regarding the impact of antimicrobial drug use in agriculture.
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the perceived accuracy and clarity of different methods for reporting antimicrobial drug use information collected regarding beef feedlots.
Producers, veterinarians, industry representatives, public health officials, and other knowledgeable beef industry leaders were invited to complete a web-based survey.
A total of 156 participants in 33 US states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 8 other countries completed the survey.
No single metric was considered universally optimal for all use circumstances or for all audiences.
To effectively communicate antimicrobial drug use data, evaluation of the target audience is critical to presenting the information.
Metrics that are most accurate need to be carefully and repeatedly explained to the audience.


Abstract
Ultrasound evaluation was performed through a lateral approach on 7 fetuses, 2 newborn calves, and 4 living calves of various ages.
The probe was positioned caudal to the vertical mandibular ramus, ventral to the base of the ear.
Three different positions of the probe were used.
The tympanic bulla and adjacent structures were successfully identified and their ultrasonographic appearance described.
Fluid within the tympanic bulla was visualized in 12 bullae in the cadavers and in 6 bullae in live calves.


Abstract
Alopecia areata and humpy-back syndrome in suckling piglets.
Both conditions were observed concurrently on the farm and occasionally in the same piglets.


Abstract
Alveolar hydatid disease (Echinococcus multilocularis) in the liver of a Canadian dog in British Columbia, a newly endemic region.
An adult dog that lived in central British Columbia was examined because of a history of lethargy and vomiting.
Histology, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination of a hepatic mass confirmed the presence of an alveolar hydatid cyst, the first description of Echinococcus multilocularis in British Columbia.
We provide recommendations for case management and remind practitioners in endemic areas of western Canada that dogs can serve as definitive and, rarely, intermediate hosts for E. multilocularis.


Abstract
Comparison of invasive and oscillometric blood pressure measurement techniques in anesthetized camelids.
This study assessed the accuracy of the oscillometric method for arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring in anesthetized camelids.
Twenty camelids were anesthetized and systolic ABP (SABP), mean ABP (MABP), and diastolic ABP (DABP) were measured directly and using the oscillometric method.
The mean difference between SABP measurements was -9.9 ± 21.9 mmHg with a range of -76 to 54 mmHg, and the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were -33 to 53 mmHg.
The difference between DABP measurements was -1.8 ± 15.6 mmHg with a range of -81 to 36 mmHg, and the 95% LOA were -32 to 29 mmHg.
The difference between MABP measurements was -2.9 ± 17.0 mmHg with a range of -81 to 36 mmHg, and the 95% LOA were -30 to 36 mmHg.
Accurate ABP monitoring in anesthetized camelids cannot be accomplished using the oscillometric method.


Abstract
Granulocytic anaplasmosis in a horse from Saskatchewan.
This report describes a case of equine granulocytic anaplasmosis in a horse from Saskatchewan.
Morulae were visualized within blood neutrophils, and the diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The organism was identified as the human pathogenic strain of Anaplasma phagocytophilum by PCR and DNA sequencing of 3 independent genes.


Abstract
Hemangiosarcoma in a geriatric Labrador retriever.
A geriatric Labrador retriever dog was presented for acute collapse.
The dog was conscious but lethargic, tachypneic, tachycardic with weak femoral pulses, occasional pulse deficits, and pale mucous membranes.
The dog was euthanized.
A necropsy, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry for CD31 and Factor VIII-related antigen cell markers supported a diagnosis of splenic hemangiosarcoma.


Abstract
Over the past 200 years, there have been periodic shifts in the terminology used to describe what is still most commonly referred to in the medical world as 'mental retardation'.
Some professionals reported being criticized for using the term.
Teaching about terminology has been variable.


Abstract
Information on the development of language, literacy and socialization are also included.


Abstract
Middle childhood, from six to 12 years of age, is often known as the 'forgotten years' of development because most research is focused on early childhood development or adolescent growth.
However, middle childhood is rich in potential for cognitive, social, emotional and physical advancements.


Abstract
Behaviour disorders are frequent in children with an intellectual disability, regardless of the underlying etiology.
They are often disabling, and can create problems in everyday life and can mask, or reveal, an organic or psychiatric illness.
Such behaviours are often chronic and more than one may be present in the same individual.
This is further complicated by the fact that parents often do not seek help for the problem, perhaps believing that it is due to the child's disability and cannot be treated.
In general, while pharmacological treatment is possible, behavioural intervention is a more effective and better tolerated form of treatment.


Abstract
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a pulmonary vasodilator that plays a major role in regulating vascular muscle tone.
It has emerged as a treatment for hypoxemic respiratory failure in newly born infants that is associated with persistent high pulmonary vascular pressure and resultant right-to-left shunting of blood (persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn).
The recommended starting dose is 20 ppm with gradual reduction of the dose following improvement in oxygenation.


Abstract
(Warren Buffett, five years ago.)
Last year's Occupy Wall Street movement suggested that people are finally catching on.
Nor is the war metaphorical.
There are real casualties, even if no body bags.
Sadly, much Canadian commentary on inequality is pitiably naïve or deliberately obfuscatory.
The 1% have captured national governments.
The astronomical cost of American elections excludes the 99%.
In Canada, parliamentary government permits one man to rule as a de facto dictator.
The 1% donot like medicare.


Abstract
Rising rates of overweight and obesity are of serious concern in Canada.
Until recently, discussion of policy options to promote healthier lifestyles has ignored the topic of direct financial incentives.
The idea of paying people to lose weight or adopt healthier behaviours is now attracting study and debate.
Some governments and companies are already experimenting with reward programs.
Targeted incentives for specific risk groups have shown more success.


Abstract
The lack of effective leadership and governance in the health sector has remained a major challenge in Nigeria and contributes to the failure of health systems and poor development of human resources.
Findings indicated that systems for human resources development exist in all participants' organizations, but the functionality of these systems was suboptimal.
More systematic and standardized processes are required to improve competencies of leadership and governance for better human resources development in low-income settings.


Abstract
The perpetual activity of the cerebral cortex is largely supported by the variety of oscillations the brain generates, spanning a number of frequencies and anatomical locations, as well as behavioral correlates.


Abstract
Data from the literature reviewed here are contradictory.
In addition, we have demonstrated a lack of effect of ELF-EMF on melatonin secretion in humans exposed to EMF (up to 20 years' exposure) which rebuts the melatonin hypothesis.
Currently, the debate concerns the effects of ELF-EMF on the risk of childhood leukemia in children chronically exposed to more than 0.4 μT.
Further research is thus needed to obtain more definite answers regarding the potential deleterious effects of ELF-EMF.


Abstract
It includes manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle such as sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance, and controlled exposure to light and dark.
The antidepressant effects of chronotherapeutics are evident in difficult-to-treat conditions such as bipolar depression, which has been associated with extremely low success rates of antidepressant drugs in naturalistic settings and with stable antidepressant response to chronotherapeutics in more than half of the patients.
Recent advances in the study of the effects of chronotherapeutics on neurotransmitter systems, and on the biological clock machinery, allow us to pinpoint its mechanism of action and to transform it from a neglected or "orphan" treatment to a powerful clinical instrument in everyday psychiatric practice.


Abstract
This archival cross-sectional investigation examined the impact of mood, reproductive status (RS), and age on polysomnographic (PSG) measures in women.
PSG was performed on 73 normal controls (NC) and 64 depressed patients (DP), in the course of studies in menstruating, pregnant, postpartum, and peri- and postmenopausal women.
A two-factor, between-subjects multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test the main effects of reproductive status (RS: menstrual vs pregnant vs postpartum vs menopausal) and diagnosis (NC vs DP), and their interaction, on PSG measures.
To further refine the analyses, a two-factor, between subjects MANOVA was used to test the main effects of age (19 to 27 vs 28 to 36 vs 37 to 45 vs 46+ years) and diagnosis on the PSG data.
Analyses revealed that in DP women, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage was significantly elevated relative to NC across both RS and age.
Significant differences in sleep efficiency, Stage 1%, and REM density were associated with RS; differences in total sleep time, Stage 2 percentage, and Stage 4 percentage were associated with differences in age.
Both RS and age were related to differences in sleep latency, Stage 3 percentage, and Delta percentage.
Finally, wake after sleep onset time, REM percentage, and REM latency did not vary with respect to RS or age.
Overall, this investigation examined three major variables (mood, RS, and age) that are known to impact sleep in women.
Of the variables, age appeared to have the greatest impact on PSG sleep measures, reflecting changes occurring across the lifespan.


Abstract
Time estimation, within a range of seconds, involves cognitive functions which depend on multiple brain regions.
Here we report on studies investigating the reproduction and production of three durations (5, 14, and 38 seconds) in four groups of patients.
The amnesic patient underproduced the length of the long durations because of episodic memory deficit following bilateral medial temporal lesions.
Further research, in neurological and psychiatric patients, is required to better understand the underlying mechanisms of time estimation.

Time has long been a major topic of study in social science, as in other sciences or in philosophy.


Abstract
Environmental light synchronizes the primary mammalian biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, as well as many peripheral clocks in tissues and cells, to the solar 24-hour day.
The beneficial effect on circadian synchronization, sleep quality, mood, and cognitive performance depends on timing, intensity, and spectral composition of light exposure.


Abstract
Diogenes syndrome (DS) is a behavioral disorder of the elderly.
To explore the phenomenon of DS in dementia we searched for the terms: "Diogenes syndrome, self-neglect, dementia. "
Researchers have underlined the frequent presence of DS (36%) in frontotemporal dementia (FTD): different neuropsychological modifications in FTD may contribute to symptoms of DS.
The initial treatment should be a behavioral program, but there is not sufficient information regarding pharmacological treatment of the syndrome.


Abstract
Low fruit and vegetable consumption is an important contributor to the global burden of disease.
In the wake of the United Nations High-level Meeting on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), held in September 2011, a rise in the consumption of fruits and vegetables is foreseeable and this increased demand will have to be met through improved supply.
The World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Bank have highlighted the potential for developing countries to benefit nutritionally and economically from the increased production and export of fruit and vegetables.
In this paper food supply chain analysis was used to show health policy-makers that Aid for Trade can provide a mechanism for increasing the supply of fruits and vegetables in developing countries.
The paper seeks to enable public health policy-makers, practitioners and advocates to improve coherence between trade and public health policies by highlighting Aid for Trade's potential role in this endeavour.


Abstract
Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research: La fécondité dans les sociétés avancées: un examen des recherches.
A secondary aim is to provide an analytical synthesis of the core determinants of fertility, grouping them within the analytical level in which they operate.
Determinants are positioned at the individual and/or couple level (micro-level), social relationships and social networks (meso-level); and, by cultural and institutional settings (macro-level).
The focus is both on the quantum and on the tempo of fertility, with a particular focus on the postponement of childbearing.
The review incorporates both theoretical and empirical contributions, with attention placed on empirically tested research and whether results support or falsify existing theoretical expectations.
Attention is also devoted to causality and endogeneity issues.
The paper concludes with an outline of the current challenges and opportunities for future research.


Abstract
KC is also beneficial for preterm infants in high-income countries.
The practice of KC should be encouraged in nurseries that care for preterm infants.
Information is available to assist in developing guidelines and protocols.


Abstract
Also known as 'cytokine inhibitors', they are proteins whose purpose is to block the action of cytokines involved in inflammation.
The desired therapeutic effect is to reduce or control inflammation.
Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors are the prototypes, but newer agents in this class target other cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-6, IL-12, and IL-23, or the proteins that target cytokine receptors on lymphocytes.
They typically act by inhibiting the normal inflammatory processes involved in the immune response, particularly for macrophages.
These agents are often used in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or steroids.
The immune-modulating effects can persist days to weeks after discontinuation.
Evidence indicates that patients treated with biologic response modifiers are at higher risk of tuberculosis infection and may be at higher risk of fungal or other infections with intracellular pathogens.


Abstract
The commonest site of contracture was the neck.
92 patients (43.19%) had received their initial burn injury management in general surgery units in tertiary care hospitals compared to 43 patients (20.18%) in district headquarter hospitals.
Only 26 patients (12.20%) were managed in plastic surgery/burn wards, and 52 patients (24.41%) received no regular treatment from any hospital.
None of the patients had the appropriate anti-deformity splintage in the affected parts or any physiotherapy during the acute phase of their burns.


Abstract
In addition, the management of burns and their sequelae is extremely expensive.
These burned children pay a costly price.


Abstract
Males were mainly affected (male to female ratio, 1.7:1).
Most of the injuries took place in the kitchen.
Age was directly related to the higher total body surface area and mortality rate.
Explosion of propane gas at home had a high incidence.
Length of hospital stay increased in relation to the burn surface area.
Infants were found to be at greatest risk for burn injuries, while older children were at higher risk for severe burns.
Before arriving at the hospital, 22 patients had received traditional therapy in the home which was not effective and caused some problems.
Pre-hospital care by emergency medicine service personnel was complete and effective.
374 patients had positive results for wound culture (42.9%).


Abstract
Length of ventilation, type and size of burn (especially inhalational burns) are related to the incidence of VAP.
Other risk factors (number of re-intubations, theatre visits) are also important.
Effective preventative strategies should be adhered to, and protocols should be implemented to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of VAP.
Clinical criteria, radiology, and broncho-alveolar lavage should be used to determine the causative organism, and there should be a low threshold for the early initiation of empiric therapy, based on the prevailing resistance patterns in the unit.
Major burns should be managed in centres where there is ready access to multidisciplinary resources and expertise.


Abstract
Chemical burns represent a major challenge for reconstructive surgeons.
They are caused by exposure to acids, alkalis or other corrosive substances which result in various degrees of injury.
This report highlights the challenges faced in managing such patients in a Nigerian teaching hospital.
The medical records of seven patients (four females and three males) treated for chemical burns injury from January 2001 to December 2010 were retrospectively reviewed.
All patients were younger than 30, with a mean age of 23.3.
Most of them (85.7%) had sustained full thickness burns ranging from 8% to 33% of their body surface area.
All cases were result of assaults.
The male to female ratio was 1:1.3, and the average duration of hospital stay was 7.5 months.
Twenty-nine surgical procedures were performed, which included nasal and lip reconstruction, ectropion release, commissuroplasty, contracture release, and wound resurfacing.
Management of chemical burns, especially in a developing country lacking specialised burn centres with appropriate facilities, is challenging.
Prevention through public awareness campaigns, legislation for control of corrosive substances, and severe punishment for perpetrators of assaults using these substances will go a long way in reducing the incidence of chemical burns.


Abstract
In extensive burns it becomes difficult for fibroblasts to migrate from the periphery of the healthy tissue and colonize the injured area.
This normal cell type is identified in keloid fibroblasts: it expresses fibrocyte markers and secretes extra cellular matrix proteins.
In-vitro collagen contraction assay reveals that fibrocytes contract collagen gels with an efficacy similar to normal fibroblasts.
The contribution of fibrocytes to the formation of keloid fibroblasts in post-burn healing is discussed.


Abstract
Of 459 burn cases, 103 (22.44%) had self-inflicted burns.
The mean total body surface area of suicide attempters was 61%, markedly higher than in other cases (20%) (P= 0.0001).
Among all self-inflicted burn cases, burns were caused by flame, while scald was the commonest cause (56.5%) in accidental burns.
Compared to all other burn cases, self-inflicted burn cases had a significantly larger mean percentage of surface body area burned (61.0±28.2 versus 20.7±15.8; P = 0.0001).
In conclusion, self-inflicted burns remain a common cause of admission to our burn unit.
The extent of burns is often large, since most suicide attempters use an accelerant that accounts for the high mortality in this group.


Abstract
This is a study of 120 patients of either sex and all ages who had sustained deep burns of up to 40% of the total body surface area.


Abstract
The contribution made by the private sector to health care in a low- or middle-income country may affect levels of physician emigration from that country.
The increasing importance of the private sector in health care in the developing world has resulted in newfound academic interest in that sector's influences on many aspects of national health systems.
The growth in physician emigration from the developing world has led to several attempts to identify both the factors that cause physicians to emigrate and the effects of physician emigration on primary care and population health in the countries that the physicians leave.
When the relevant data on the emerging economies of Ghana, India and Peru were investigated, it appeared that the proportion of physicians participating in private health-care delivery, the percentage of health-care costs financed publicly and the amount of private health-care financing per capita were each inversely related to the level of physician expatriation.
It therefore appears that private health-care delivery and financing may decrease physician emigration.
There is clearly a need for similar research in other low- and middle-income countries, and for studies to see if, at the country level, temporal trends in the contribution made to health care by the private sector can be related to the corresponding trends in physician emigration.
The ways in which private health care may be associated with access problems for the poor and therefore reduced equity also merit further investigation.
The results should be of interest to policy-makers who aim to improve health systems worldwide.


Abstract
A rare but potentially challenging complication of osteoporosis is a sternal insufficiency fracture.
The purpose of this case report is to heighten awareness around distinct characteristics of sternal fractures in osteoporotic patients.
Discussion focuses on the incidence, mechanism, associated factors and diagnostic challenge of sternal insufficiency fractures.


Abstract
This study investigates how the language of chiropractic has changed over time.
The results were compared to a corpus of recent articles from the Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association.
This permitted the identification of words which were over-represented in the historical literature and therefore likely have become somewhat archaic or represent themes which are of less import in the modern chiropractic literature.
Words which were over-represented in the historical literature often referred to anatomical, pathological and biomechanical concepts.
A detailed analysis is presented of trends in the use of the conceptually important terms subluxation and adjustment.


Abstract
The part played by various politicians, educators, entrepreneurs, legal counsel, academic administrators and historians is also discussed.


Abstract
Global surgery initiatives increasingly are focused on strengthening education and local health care systems to build surgical capacity.
We developed an 8-week teaching schedule for undergraduate students and an electronic database of clinical surgery topics.
In addition, we started teaching basic surgical skills in the operating theatre, bridging to an official and recurring workshop through a supporting international surgery organization.
The medical and assistant medical officer students reported increased satisfaction with their clinical surgery rotations and mastery of key educational subjects.
The initiation of an Essential Surgical Skills workshop through the Canadian Network for International Surgery showed students had improved comfort with basic surgical techniques.
Short-term surgical missions may appear to fill a void in the shortage of health care in the developing world.
However, we conclude that global health resources are more appropriately used through projects giving ownership to local providers and promoting education as a foundation of development.
This results in better coordination among local and visiting providers and greater impact on education and long-term growth of health care capacity.


Abstract
Paediatric research may well be the first field in which the ethical implications of next-generation sequencing (NGS) will be appreciated.
Parents must act in their 'medical' best interests.
Current policy guidance on this issue in Canada is unclear.


Abstract
RLS is associated with brain iron insufficiency and dopaminergic dysfunction.
Diagnosis requires fulfillment of diagnostic criteria, which for children are currently in evolution, and have limitations, especially in preschoolers.
A 3 mg to 6 mg elemental iron/kg/day dose for three months could be tried if the ferritin level is <50 ug/L.
Sleep hygiene and behavioural strategies are also recommended.
Iron supplementation should be safe in the absence of iron metabolism disorders, provided that transferrin saturation and ferritin levels are monitored pre-and post-treatment.


Abstract
KD is uncommon in the first year of life and is rare in the newborn period.
Additionally, the association of this clinical picture with very high serum ferritin levels raises the possibility of a link with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate hepatocyte apoptosis in dairy cows during the transition period.
Four clinically healthy, pregnant dairy cattle were used.
The cows had no clinical diseases throughout this study.
Blood samples were collected and livers were biopsied from the cows at 3 different times: 3 weeks before expected partition (wk -3); during parturition (wk 0), and 3 weeks (wk +3) after parturition.
The damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) caused by hepatocytes was evaluated by comet assay.
The apoptotic features of hepatocytes were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopic analyses.
The hepatic triglyceride content markedly increased at wk 0 and wk +3 compared with the values at wk -3.
The results of the comet assay showed increases in the mean tail moment values of hepatic cells after parturition in all cows, which suggested increased DNA damage.
Caspase-3-positive and single-stranded DNA-(ssDNA)-positive cells were first detected in the liver after parturition.
Condensation of nuclear chromatin, a typical sign of apoptosis, was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy after parturition.
These results suggest that apoptosis is induced in hepatocytes of dairy cows around parturition and may result from lipotoxicity in hepatocytes.


Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterized by a delayed and defective adaptive immune response.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to compare the effect on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane when ketamine was administered either after or without prior determination of the baseline MAC of isoflurane in rabbits.
Using a prospective randomized crossover study, 8 adult, female New Zealand rabbits were allocated to 2 treatment groups.
Anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane.
Group 1 (same-day determination) had the MAC-sparing effect of ketamine [1 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) bolus followed by a constant rate infusion (CRI) of 40 μg/kg BW per min, given by intravenous (IV)], which was determined after the baseline MAC of isoflurane was determined beforehand.
A third MAC determination was started 30 min after stopping the CRI.
Group 2 (separate-day determination) had the MAC-sparing effect of ketamine determined without previous determination of the baseline MAC of isoflurane.
A second MAC determination was started 30 min after stopping the CRI.
In group 1, the MAC of isoflurane (2.15 ± 0.09%) was significantly decreased by ketamine (1.63 ± 0.07%).
After stopping the CRI, the MAC was significantly less (2.04 ± 0.11%) than the baseline MAC of isoflurane and significantly greater than the MAC during the CRI.
In group 2, ketamine decreased isoflurane MAC (1.53 ± 0.22%) and the MAC increased significantly (1.94 ± 0.25%) after stopping the CRI.
Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values did not differ significantly between the groups either during ketamine administration or after stopping ketamine.
Under the study conditions, prior determination of the baseline isoflurane MAC did not alter the effect of ketamine on MAC.
Both methods of determining MAC seemed to be valid for research purposes.


Abstract
The effects of selenium (Se) supplementation and source on equine immune function have not been extensively studied.
This study examined the effects of oral Se supplementation and Se source on aspects of innate and adaptive immunity in horses.
Fifteen horses were assigned to 1 of 3 groups (5 horses/group): control, inorganic Se (sodium selenite), organic Se (Se yeast).
Plasma, red blood cell Se, and blood glutathione peroxidase activity were measured.
Plasma and red blood cell Se were highest in horses in the organic Se group, compared with that of inorganic Se or control groups.
Selenium supplementation increased relative neutrophil expression of IL-1 and IL-8.
Other measures of immune function were unaffected.


Abstract
Piglets with high levels of maternal PCV2 antibodies at 1 wk of age were randomly grouped into vaccinates and controls on the basis of body weight and inoculated with the vaccine or a control preparation twice, with an interval of 3 wk.
Both groups were challenged 3 wk after the booster vaccination and euthanized 3 wk after challenge.
The PCV2 antibody titers were monitored by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay throughout the experiment.


Abstract
The effects of 2 different continuous rate infusions (CRIs) of medetomidine over an 8-hour period on sedation score, selected cardiopulmonary parameters, and serum levels of medetomidine were evaluated in 6 healthy, conscious dogs using a crossover study design.
The treatment groups were: CONTROL = saline bolus followed by saline CRI; MED1 = 2 μg/kg body weight (BW) medetomidine loading dose followed by 1 μg/kg BW per hour CRI; and MED2 = 4 μg/kg BW medetomidine loading dose followed by 2 μg/kg BW per hour CRI.
Sedation score (SS), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (TEMP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), arterial and mixed venous blood gas analyses, lactate, and plasma levels of medetomidine were evaluated at baseline, at various intervals during the infusion, and 2 h after terminating the infusion.
Statistical analysis involved a repeated measures linear model.
Both infusion rates of medetomidine-induced dose-dependent increases in SS and dose-dependent decreases in HR, SAP, MAP, and DAP were measured.


Abstract
There were no significant differences among the groups for the CAdV-1 antibody titers.


Abstract
The arguments in favour of this position fall into three broad categories: Compulsory treatment centres infringe on an individual's liberty, they put human beings at risk of harm, and evidence of their effectiveness against opioid dependence has not been generated.
The United Nations statement underscores that although countries apply different criteria for sending individuals to compulsory treatment centres, detention often takes place without due process, legal safeguards or judicial review.
This clearly violates internationally recognized human rights standards.
Furthermore, people who are committed to these centres are often exposed to physical and sexual violence, forced labour and sub-standard living conditions.
They are often denied health care, despite their heightened vulnerability to HIV infection and tuberculosis.
Finally, there is no evidence, according to the statement, that these centres offer an environment that is conducive to recovery from opioid dependence or to the rehabilitation of commercial sex workers or of children who have suffered sexual exploitation, abuse or lack of care and protection.


Abstract
This is due, in large part, to reduced synaptic plasticity caused by changes in the molecular composition of the postsynaptic membrane.
This active regulation of AMPAR synthesis, targeting, synaptic dwell time, and degradation is fundamentally important for memory formation and storage.


Abstract
Cerebral aging is a complex and heterogenous process related to a large variety of molecular changes involving multiple neuronal networks, due to alterations of neurons (synapses, axons, dendrites, etc), particularly affecting strategically important regions, such as hippocampus and prefrontal areas.
Part of neuroplasticity is adult neurogenesis in specific areas of the brain, in particular the hippocampal formation important for memory function, the decline of which is common even in "healthy" aging.
To obtain further insights into the mechanisms of brain plasticity and adult neurogenesis, as the basis for prevention and potential therapeutic options, is a major challenge of modern neurosciences.


Abstract
Aging is a physiological process that can develop without the appearance of concurrent diseases.
However, very frequently, older people suffer from memory loss and an accelerated cognitive decline.
Today we know that the aging brain retains a considerable functional plasticity, and that this plasticity is positively promoted by genes activated by different lifestyle factors.
In this article some of these lifestyle factors and their mechanisms of action are reviewed, including environmental enrichment and the importance of food intake and some nutrients.
Aerobic physical exercise and reduction of chronic stress are also briefly reviewed.


Abstract
Conceptualizations of the underlying neurobiology of major depression have changed their focus from dysfunctions of neurotransmission to dysfunctions of neurogenesis and neuroprotection.
The "neurogenesis hypothesis of depression" posits that changes in the rate of neurogenesis are the underlying mechanism in the pathology and treatment of major depression.
Stress, neuroinflammation, dysfunctional insulin regulation, oxidative stress, and alterations in neurotrophic factors possibly contribute to the development of depression.
The influence of antidepressant therapies, namely pharmacotherapy and neuroprotectants, on cellular plasticity are summarized.


Abstract
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to probe cortical function and treat neuropsychiatric illnesses.
TMS has demonstrated neuroplastic effects akin to long-term potentiation and long-term depression, and therapeutic applications are in development for post-stroke recovery, Alzheimer's disease, and depression in seniors.
Here, we discuss two new directions of TMS research relevant to cerebral aging and cognition.
First, we introduce a paradigm for enhancing cognitive reserve, based on our research in sleep deprivation.
Whether in the enhancement of cognition as a treatment goal, or in the reduction of amnesia as a side effect, these approaches to the use of TMS and MST merit further exploration regarding their clinical potential.

The human brain shrinks with advancing age, but recent research suggests that it is also capable of remarkable plasticity, even in late life.
The specificity of these effects, we argue, provides a biological basis for understanding the capacity for physical activity to influence neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression.


Abstract
We note that the effect of cognitive training is surprisingly durable over time, but that the evidence that training effects transfer to other cognitive domains is relatively limited.


Abstract
A central tenet of brain aging is that "what is good for the heart is good for the brain."
At baseline and 3 years later, cognitive scores were correlated with plasma apoE levels in both E4- and E4+, and HDL level in E4-.


Abstract
The cheek and nose are common areas for skin cancers.
There are multiple approaches to surgical excision and reconstruction, depending on the size of defect, tissue quality, adjacent cosmetic units and hairline.
An effective solution to skin defects of the lateral cheek is the bilobed flap.
This flap tends to be underused in the lateral cheek area because primary closure and skin grafts are perceived to be easier methods of reconstruction.
However, the use of the bilobed flap for lateral cheek and other defect closures is encouraged.
There are several basic principles that are key when performing this flap.
These components of the procedure are highlighted.


Abstract
In China, alcohol consumption is increasing faster than anywhere else in the world.
Despite these trends, China's policies on the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages are weak compared with those of other countries in Asia.
Weakest of all are its policies on taxation, drink driving laws, alcohol sale to minors and marketing licenses.


Abstract
In theory, the removal of user fees puts health services within reach of everyone, including the very poor.
When Burkina Faso adopted the DOTS strategy for the control of tuberculosis, the intention was to provide free tuberculosis care.
In 2007-2008, interviews were used to collect information from 242 smear-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were enrolled in the national tuberculosis control programme in six rural districts.
The median direct costs associated with tuberculosis were estimated at 101 United States dollars (US$) per patient.
These costs represented 23% of the mean annual income of a patient's household.
During the course of their care, three quarters of the interviewed patients apparently faced "catastrophic" health expenditure.
Inadequacies in the health system and policies appeared to be responsible for nearly half of the direct costs (US$ 45 per patient).
Although the households of patients developed coping strategies, these had far-reaching, adverse effects on the quality of lives of the households' members and the socioeconomic stability of the households.
Each tuberculosis patient lost a median of 45 days of work as a result of the illness.
For a population living on or below the poverty line, every failure in health-care delivery increases the risk of "catastrophic" health expenditure, exacerbates socioeconomic inequalities, and reduces the probability of adequate treatment and cure.
In Burkina Faso, a policy of "free" care for tuberculosis patients has not met with complete success.
These observations should help define post-2015 global strategies for tuberculosis care, prevention and control.


Abstract
Although the 99% decrease seen in global polio incidence between 1988 and 2000 represented remarkable progress towards polio eradication, tackling the last 1% of polio has proved tantalizingly difficult.
Pockets of endemic transmission currently persist both on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
These pockets have permitted the reinfection of countries that were previously polio-free.
By paying attention to these human qualities, the stakeholders involved may be more likely to achieve global polio eradication.


Abstract
Ethical considerations are crucial when deciding on vaccine deployment.
The authors lay out the ethical issues that policy-makers need to bear in mind when considering the deployment of mass vaccination during humanitarian emergencies, including beneficence (duty of care and the rule of rescue), non-maleficence, autonomy and consent, and distributive and procedural justice.


Abstract
The World Health Organization has promoted health impact assessment (HIA) for over 20 years.
At the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), HIA was discussed as a critical method for linking health to "green economy" and "institutional framework" strategies for sustainable development.
In countries having a high human development index (HDI), HIA has been added to the overall assessment suite that typically includes potential environmental and social impacts, but it is rarely required as part of the environmental and social impact assessment for large development projects.
When they are performed, project-driven HIAs are governed by a combination of project proponent and multilateral lender performance standards rather than host country requirements.
Not surprisingly, in low-HDI countries HIA is missing from the programme and policy arena in the absence of an external project driver.
If the cloak of HIA invisibility is to be removed, it must be shown that HIA is useful and beneficial and, hence, an essential component of the 21st century's sustainable development agenda.
We analyse where and how HIA can become fully integrated into the impact assessment suite and argue that the impact of HIA must not remain obscure.


Abstract
Explanatory model of cattle death by starvation in Manitoba: forensic evaluation.
Cattle death by starvation is a persistent annual event in Manitoba.
Herds with more than 10% overwinter death loss are usually identified in the late winter or early spring.
Field and postmortem findings suggest that there is complete mobilization of fat followed by inability to maintain adequate thermoregulation and death by cardiac arrest.
Carcasses show only mild evidence of muscle catabolism and are in excellent preservation if located prior to or around the time of spring thaw.


Abstract
Fish consumption is of great importance to children's health and is essential for neurodevelopment, which begins in pregnancy and continues throughout early childhood and into adolescence.
This may be challenging to communicate.
The present review was performed to assess the current knowledge and recommendations around 'smart' fish-consumption decisions.
The current literature must attempt to handle the challenges inherent in communicating the dilemmas of children's fish consumption.
Incorporation of new knowledge translation strategies are proposed as a means to raise the level of knowledge about optimal fish consumption practices.


Abstract
Children with acute asthma exacerbations frequently present to an emergency department with signs of respiratory distress.
The most severe episodes are potentially life-threatening.
Effective treatment depends on the accurate and rapid assessment of disease severity at presentation.


Abstract
When Canadian researchers examine the subject of medical tourism, they typically focus on ethical, social, public health and health policy issues related to Canadians seeking health services in other countries.
They emphasize study of Canada as a departure point for medical tourists rather than as a potential destination for international patients.
Several influential voices have recently argued that provincial healthcare systems in Canada should market health services to international patients.


Abstract
The ratio of patients to physicians has long been used as a tool for measuring and planning healthcare resources in Canada.
Some current changes in primary care, such as enrolment of patients with physicians, make this ratio easier to calculate, while others, such as changing practice structure, make it more complex to interpret.


Abstract
"Maintaining a dynamic biopharmaceutical industry" is one of four main axes of the drug policy of Quebec's ministry of health.
However, this role of government should not take precedence over the efficient and equitable management of health resources.
We defend the legitimate and responsible choice of the Institut national d'excellence en santé et en services sociaux du Québec (INESSS) to require an acceptable cost-effectiveness ratio from expensive new drugs.


Abstract
This study examines the factors that are associated with acute care ALC days among patients with acquired brain injury (ABI).
We used the Discharge Abstract Database to identify patients with ABI using International Classification of Disease-10 codes.
From fiscal years 2007/08 to 2009/10, 17.5% of patients with traumatic and 14% of patients with non-traumatic brain injury had at least one ALC day.
Significant predictors include having a psychiatric co-morbidity, increasing age and length of stay in acute care.
These findings can inform planning for care of people with ABI in a publicly funded healthcare system.


Abstract
This paper compares the content of press articles with the content of three Canadian HTA reports that respectively assess electroconvulsive therapy, first-trimester prenatal screening for Down syndrome, and prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer.
We qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed 186 press articles addressing the same technologies.
Our results show that beyond stylistic emphasis, there is an important overlap between media coverage of these technologies and the content of HTA reports.
Findings also highlight shared interests on which both researchers and journalists could build to enhance the communication of health information to the public.


Abstract
While the use of regression is promising, finding these "best" ratios is too analytically complex for general practice.
The paper concludes by providing and evaluating an easy-to-use planning method, which we call the average flow model (AFM).
The AFM combines demand forecasts with length-of-stay estimates to produce enhanced capacity plans.
The AFM is transparent, easily implemented in a spreadsheet and well suited for "what if?" analyses.


Abstract
Using document analysis, we found that RFS programs were available in nearly all provinces and territories.
RFS bursaries fund trainees who plan to remain in the province rather than attract new trainees to the province.
These bursaries may nonetheless serve to reinforce the decisions of physicians who are predisposed to work in an underserved community.


Abstract
This first allows an exact analysis of a malunion, the development of a plan for the correction and finally the virtual performance of the operation.
The new possibilities of this ostetomy technique are presented with 4 examples/cases from the hand surgery.


Abstract
Treatment consists of statins, as well as lifestyle modifications such as body weight control and increased physical exercise.
The latter constitute the primary intervention in patients at low cardiovascular risk.


Abstract
The incidence of adverse drug events (ADE) in hospitalized patients and ambulatory care is high.
The reduction of ADE incidence is badly needed.


Abstract
A decision to hospitalize will be based on specific symptoms and signs, as well on the patient's history.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to identify a suitable alternative to the current practice of complementing the feeding of milk by-products with straw.
The influence of 5 different types of solid feeds on health and performance of Swiss veal calves was investigated in 2 production cycles of 200 veal calves each with a mean initial age of 40 days (d).
The calves were housed in groups of 40 in stalls with outside pen.
Liquid feeding consisted of a milk by-product combined with an additional skim milk powder ad libitum.
Groups were assigned to 1 of the 5 following experimental solid feeds provided ad libitum: mix (composition: soy flakes, corn, barley, wheat, oat, barley middling, plant oil, molasses), whole plant corn pellets, corn silage, hay, and wheat straw as control.
Daily dry matter intake per calf averaged 2.25 kg of the liquid food, 0.16 kg of straw, 0.33 kg of mix, 0.47 kg of corn silage, 0.38 kg of corn pellets, and 0.39 kg of hay.
Four percent of the calves were slaughtered prematurely.
Compared to the 4 other groups, calves of the straw group showed the highest prevalence of abnormal ruminal content (73 %, P < 0.05), of abnormal ruminal papillae (42 %, P < 0.05), of abomasal fundic lesions (13.5 %, P < 0.1), and the lowest number of chewing movements per bolus (45, P < 0.05).
The duration of the fattening period averaged 114 d, slaughter age 157 d, and carcass weight 122 kg.
The average daily weight gain (ADG) was highest in the control group straw (1.35 kg), and lowest in the hay group (1.22 kg, P < 0.01).
No significant differences between groups were found in meat color (P > 0.1): 73 % of the carcasses were assessed as pale (267/364), 18 % as pink (66/364), and 9 % (31/364) as red.
The results reveal that whole-plant corn pellets are most consistent with an optimal result combining the calves' health and fattening performance.
Therefore, it can be recommended as an additional solid feed for veal calves under Swiss conditions.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to identify a suitable alternative to the current practice of complementing the feeding of whole milk with straw.
The influence of 3 different solid supplements on the health and performance of Swiss veal calves was investigated during 3 production cycles of 90 veal calves each with a mean initial age of 42 days and a mean initial weight of 68.7 kg.
The calves were housed in groups of 30 in stalls strewn with wheat straw without outside pen.
Liquid feeding consisted of whole milk combined with an additional skim milk powder ad libitum.
Calves of the straw group showed significantly more abomasal lesions in the fundic part as compared to the pellet mix and corn pellets groups (P < 0.001), the prevalence of insufficient papillae was highest (P < 0.05), and ruminating behavior was unsatisfactory.
In contrast to the pellet mix and straw groups, performance of calves in the corn pellets group was good.
Additionally, prevalence of abomasal fundic lesions was lowest (P < 0.001), and rumen development was best in calves of the corn pellets group (P < 0.01).


Abstract
Quantitative RT-PCR for pestivirus detection and an ELISA to detect pestivirus antibodies were used in 2'384 and 2'291 ovine blood samples, respectively.
The flock seroprevalence ranged from 0.0 to 73.9 %.


Abstract
The World Health Organization (WHO) constitution states: "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."
More than 450 million people suffer from mental disorders worldwide.


Abstract
Mary Main proposed a D classification and interpreted such behaviour as a breakdown in an ABC strategy caused by a conflict between a disposition to approach and flee from the caregiver.
Patricia Crittenden extended the subtypes of A and C, using a developmental model of information processing, and observed that they could be used together in A/C combinations.
These letters offer insight into Ainsworth's intellectual rationale for encouraging both Main and Crittenden in their conflicting endeavours.


Abstract
Check-up is a frequent motivation for patients to see their general practitioner.
The challenge lies in the choice of screening tools to accomplish an efficient, individual and age-adapted approach.


Abstract
Diarrhea is a frequent and complex entity which is caused by a large number of infectious and non-infectious reasons.
A detailed clinical and epidemiological history will define whether an additional laboratory work-up and treatment is indicated.
The key element of treatment of acute diarrhea is rehydration.


Abstract
Acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) were first described for use in breast surgery in 2001.
The present article reviews the history of ADM use in breast surgery and the outcomes reported to date.
Common techniques for placement of ADMs in aesthetic revisionary and breast reconstruction surgery are provided, and use in the setting of chest wall irradiation and capsular contracture is discussed.
Finally, the authors comment on the cost implications of these products in the Canadian and American health care systems.


Abstract
A detailed literature review is also included.


Abstract
The donor site area of the dorsum of the foot was grafted, and deambulation was reassumed three weeks later.
Advantages, limits and anatomical consideration regarding the viability of the flap are also discussed.


Abstract
Except in very few specific medical situations, breastfeeding should be universally encouraged for all mothers and infants.
To improve worldwide breastfeeding initiation and duration rates, the WHO and UNICEF launched the Baby-Friendly Initiative (BFI) in 1991.
Health care practitioners have a unique and influential role in promoting and supporting breastfeeding.
Provincial and territorial government leadership is essential to ensuring implementation of the BFI in all health care facilities delivering services to families with young children.


Abstract
There is a problem with sleep initiation and maintenance in 15% to 25% of children and adolescents.
These studies demonstrate benefit with minimal side effects.
However, all studies have involved small numbers of subjects and address only short-term use of melatonin.
There are no good data concerning the safety and efficacy of long-term melatonin use.
Further studies are needed to confirm the usefulness and safety of melatonin for sleep disorders in children and adolescents.


Abstract
Albumin, a serum transport protein, provides 80% of colloid osmotic pressure.
Congenital analbuminemia (CAA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by absence of serum albumin.
Fifty cases of CAA have been reported throughout the world; however, little is known about its clinical impact.
Most reported cases have few clinical signs and symptoms.
Twelve local cases from the northwestern central plains region in Saskatchewan were identified and reviewed to ascertain morbidity and mortality related with CAA.
All the cases are from two remote First Nations communities.
Cases had frequent hospital admissions and recurrent respiratory tract infections.
Placental abnormalities included hydropic placentas, placental infarcts and microcalcifications.
One-half of the cases were born preterm and one-quarter were small for their gestational age.
There were three mortalities in the case series.
The present case series suggests increased morbidity and mortality during infancy in patients with CAA.


Abstract
In the present report, the first reported case of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated enterocolic fistula in an HIV/AIDS patient is described.
CMV colitis is the second most common presentation of CMV infection in immunocompromised patients.
CMV-associated enteric fistulae are an exceedingly rare complication, with only four previous cases described: a gastrocolic, an enterocutaneous, a rectovaginal and a colocutaneous fistula.
Management of these patient demonstrates the importance of treating the precipitating viral infection before considering surgical intervention of the enterocolic fistula.


Abstract
Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the predominant cause of bovine intra-mammary infections.
They can lead to chronic infections and were reported to significantly increase milk somatic cell counts.
The goal of our study was to determine the species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of CNS in bovine mastitis milk samples in Switzerland.
Between March 2011 and February 2012, a total of 120 CNS were isolated from mastitis milk samples from 117 different animals at 77 farms.
The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and subsequently tested for sensitivity to various antibiotic agents by disk diffusion.
Antimicrobial agents were selected mainly based on their relevance to the treatment of bovine mastitis in Switzerland.
MALDI-TOF MS assigned the 120 isolates to 12 different staphylococcal species - S. chromogenes (33 %), S. xylosus (28 %), S. sciuri (13 %), S. haemolyticus (9 %), S. epidermidis (4 %), S. simulans (4 %), S. warneri (3 %), S. equorum (2 %), S. hyicus (2 %), S. cohnii (1 %), S. succinus (1 %), and S. fleuretti (1 %).
Resistance rates in CNS were high, with 39% of isolates exhibiting resistance to ampicillin and penicillin, 6% of isolates being resistant to amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, cephalothin, and cefoxitin, and 5 % being resistant to erythromycin.
In rare cases resistance to gentamicin (2 %), kanamycin (2 %), and kanamycin-cefalexin (1 %) was detected.


Abstract
Resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides was also detected in the strains tested.


Abstract
The antibiotics were chosen on the basis of their licenses for intramammary application in Switzerland.
Genetic analysis grouped most of the strains (87 %) into phylogenetic groups A and B1.


Abstract
Although 5 strains were phenotypically resistant to penicillin, the other 5 (all belonging the clonal complex 8) were penicillin susceptible.
PCR amplification confirmed the presence of the blaZ, blaR and blaI genes in all 5 strains.
Additionally single nucleotide insertions and deletions were detected in blaR of 3 strains.


Abstract
The average body weights at treatment were 16 kg (piglets) and 29 kg (fatteners).
Calculated PIDvet on a given day was 180.9 for the whole population, 297.6 for piglets and 83.2 for fatteners.


Abstract
The use of ultrasound is already routine in contraceptive procedures.
One of the best examples is the transvaginal assessment of the IUD position.


Abstract
Ultrasound-diagnostic plays a major role in identifying intrahepatic or extrahepatic jaundice.
Moreover, the consequences of liver enzyme elevations including further diagnostic procedures, are highlighted.
Finally, possibilities and limitations of modern diagnostic tests for liver fibrosis are briefly overviewed.


Abstract
The focal renal lesions are altogether common.
Most frequently are found Columna Bertini hypertrophies (so called pseudotumors) and simple renal cysts.
The role of sonography in the practice is to distinguish pseudotumors from real renal tumors, and simple renal cysts from complex cysts.
The real tumors can be differentiated from certain focal non-tumorous changes based on the ultrasound and clinic.
In all uncertain or unclear cases, therefore, an open or ultrasound-guided biopsy is useful.


Abstract
We report a case of transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) in a 59-year-old man including the clinical presentation, diagnostic studies, management and clinical progress.
TOH is a rare self-limiting condition that typically affects middle-aged men or, less frequently, women in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Affected individuals present clinically with acute hip pain, limping gait, and limited ranges of hip motion.
TOH may begin spontaneously or after a minor trauma.
Radiographs are typically unremarkable but MR imaging studies yield findings consistent with bone marrow edema.
TOH is referred to as regional migratory osteoporosis if it travels to other joints or the contralateral hip.
TOH often resembles osteonecrosis but the two conditions must be differentiated due to different prognoses and management approaches.
The term TOH is often used interchangeably and synonymously with transient bone marrow edema.


Abstract
Peri-articular fractures after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery are rare.
To our knowledge, this case documents the first insufficiency fracture of the tibial plateau after ACL reconstruction, which presented three weeks after the procedure.
Good functional outcome was achieved after conservative management, with minimal loss of terminal knee extension and minimal pain at 22-month follow-up.


Abstract
Straight Back Syndrome (SBS) has been recognized for over 50 years.
Not to be confused with flat back syndrome in the lumbar spine, SBS patients present with an obvious loss of the thoracic kyphosis accompanied by apparent heart symptoms.
The use of diagnostic and laboratory tests are essential to differentially diagnose cardiac disease from SBS.
Genesis and incidence of this condition is also discussed as well as roentgenometric analysis.
A suggested diagnostic algorithm is presented as well.


Abstract
Fractures of the scapula are relatively uncommon.
Fractures specific to the scapular body comprise 35-65% of these fractures.
We present the conservative management of three patients with comminuted fractures involving the scapular body that were managed in chiropractic settings.
Residual disabilities in these three patients as measured by a standardized outcome tool were 2%, 5% and 23% after 3 years, 2 years, and 6 years respectively.


Abstract
Public health authorities have been alarmed by the progressive rise in rates of Caesarean section in Canada, approaching one birth in three in several provinces.
We aimed therefore to consider what were preventable obstetrical interventions in women with a low-risk pregnancy and to propose an analytic framework for the reduction of the rate of CS.
We obtained statistical variations of CS rates over time, across regions, and within professional practices from MED-ÉCHO, the Quebec hospitalization database, from 1969 to 2009.
Data were extracted from a recent systematic review of the cascade of obstetrical interventions to calculate the population-attributable fractions for each intervention associated with an increased probability of CS.
We thereby identified expectant management (as an alternative to labour induction) and planned vaginal birth after CS as the leading strategies for potentially reducing rates of CS in women at low risk.
For vaginal birth after CS, an increase to its 1995 level could lower the current CS rate of 23.2% (2009 to 2010) to 21.0%.
We believe, therefore, that the concept of preventable CS is supported by empirical evidence, and we identified realistic strategies to maintain a CS rate in Quebec near 20%.


Abstract
Behavioural addictions share characteristics with substance and alcohol abuse, and in areas such as natural history, phenomenology, and adverse consequences.
Few studies have examined the efficacy of pharmacological and psychological treatment for the various behavioural addictions, and therefore, currently, no treatment recommendations can be made.


Abstract
This review summarizes neurobiological and genetic findings in behavioural addictions, draws parallels with findings pertaining to substance use disorders, and offers suggestions for future research.
Articles concerning brain function, neurotransmitter activity, and family history and (or) genetic findings for behavioural addictions involving gambling, Internet use, video game playing, shopping, kleptomania, and sexual activity were reviewed.
Behavioural addictions involve dysfunction in several brain regions, particularly the frontal cortex and striatum.
Findings from imaging studies incorporating cognitive tasks have arguably been more consistent than cue-induction studies.
Early results suggest white and grey matter differences.
Neurochemical findings suggest roles for dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, but results from clinical trials seem more equivocal.
While limited, family history and genetic data support heritability for pathological gambling and that people with behavioural addictions are more likely to have a close family member with some form of psychopathology.
Parallels exist between neurobiological and genetic and family history findings in substance and nonsubstance addictions, suggesting that compulsive engagement in these behaviours may constitute addictions.
To date, findings are limited, particularly for shopping, kleptomania, and sexual behaviour.
Genetic understandings are at an early stage.
Future research directions are offered.


Abstract
Burn injuries in both developed and developing countries cause long-term disability, mortality, and socio-economic costs that are imposed on patients, families, and societies.
This study was carried out to investigate the epidemiology, outcome, and cost of hospitalization of 388 burn patients admitted to the Imam Khomeini Hospital Burn Center in Kermanshah, Iran, between 21 March 2011 and 20 March 2012.
The data about demographics, cause of burns, degree of burns, outcome of burns, burned body surface (BBS), length of stay (LOS), and cost of hospitalization were collected by reviewing medical records and analysed by SPSS 16.
The patients' mean age was 27 years.
The male/female ratio in burn patients was 1.14/1.
The mean BBS was 36.06%.
The mean LOS was 9.04 days.
Flame (67.0%) and hot liquids (21.9%) were the major causes of burn.
11.6% of patients had all the regions involved.
The fatality rate was 18.8%.
The mean cost per patient was 20,463,227 Iran Rials (IRR).
The cost per one percentage of burn and one day of hospitalization was 562,632 IRR and 2,263,631 IRR, respectively.
The main factors relevant to death were identified including the extent of burn, gender, age, causes, and degree of burn.
In addition, LOS proved to have a higher impact on costs than burn percentage.


Abstract
Easter is the most important holiday for the Greek Church.
It is rich in traditions and rituals but during the Greek Easter festivities, especially at midnight Mass on Easter Saturday night, it is customary to throw fireworks around.
These fireworks are not part of the true Easter tradition and they are potentially fatal.
Unfortunately, in the past few years, the custom has become more and more popular in Greece.
There are some local variations, mainly in the Aegean islands, where homemade rockets are used to have a "rocket war".
The rockets consist of wooden sticks loaded with an explosive mixture containing gunpowder and launched from special platforms.
Many severe injuries involving loss of sight and limbs as well as major burns are also caused by the use of illegal fireworks at Easter.
Every year numerous burn victims are hospitalized.
The most affected areas are the face, the upper extremities, and the chest, often in association with slight or severe wounds and injuries.
This study presents our department's experience with incidents due to the use of fireworks during Easter festivities.


Abstract
Burns represent an important health and economic problem in Africa and in the developing countries.
Prevention programs in the developing countries are still at an infant phase.
It is well known that prevention includes surveillance with data analysis and reporting.
The aim of this paper is to identify the risk factors in communities in order to implement communitybased burn prevention strategies, not only on the African continent but also in other developing countries.
Effective prevention programs are highlighted.
Three examples are discussed where political commitment is mobilised to ensure regulatory action.
Other programs are cost-effective and have long-lasting effects, but they take time.
Cochrane database system reviews highlighted the problems when people were encouraged to change their lifestyle.
NGOs play a definite role in developing countries, and in Bangladesh and Pakistan efforts are being made to curb acid-throwing violence.
Communities consist of many groups.


Abstract
The Burn Specific Health Scale - Brief (BSHS-B) is one of the most commonly used instruments for the evaluation of quality of life after burn injury.
It can be self-administered, and it is useful in evaluating psychopathological symptoms in burn victims.
The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the BSHS-B into Greek, assessing its internal consistency and validity.
The cultural adaptation included forward and backward translation, reconciliation, and a pilot study.
The Greek version was administered to a sample of 40 adult burn victims admitted to our Burn Centre.
Internal consistency was verified using Cronbach's alpha, and construct validity was evaluated through correlation with the Short Form of Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) using Spearman analysis.
The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the questionnaire's total score was 0.954, demonstrating that the internal consistency of the Greek version was very high.
The test-retest coefficient using kappa correlation was 0.830 (p < 0.001).
Significant correlations were identified between BSHS-B subscales and the SF-36 subscales - Physical and Social Functioning, and Emotional Role.
Despite the limited size of the sample, the Greek version of the BSHS-B shows good reliability and construct validity and can be used in clinical practice for further evaluations of burn patients' quality of life.


Abstract
This study addresses maternal and foetal complications in pregnant women hospitalized for burn injuries in 2003-2008.
It was a retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study, carried out in pregnant women hospitalized in the burn ward of Imam- Khomeini Hospital, Iran, in 2003-2008 (burn injury rate, 1.88%, 39 cases; mean age, 23.51 ± 4.78 yr).
The pregnant woman death rate was 66.7%: 26 patients died because of burn complications and 13 patients (23.3%) survived.
The causes and circumstances of the fatalities are reported.
There was a statistically significant relationship between burn severity and foetal and maternal mortality rates (p < 0.02).
Burn severity was not statistically related to premature delivery and mode of delivery.
The factors affecting prognosis and the maternal and foetal death rates were the total burn area, continuous clinical surveillance of the mother and foetus, and employment of appropriate treatment protocols.


Abstract
Hairdressing-related burns are preventable and therefore each case is one too many.
The wound on the nape of the neck required surgical debridement and skin grafting.
The grafted area resulted in subsequent scar formation.


Abstract
This may serve as a reminder to professionals to be cautious about the pitfalls that lead to such preventable injuries.


Abstract
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a volume of plasma fraction of autologous blood having platelet concentrations above baseline whole-blood values due to processing and concentration.
PRP is used in various surgical fields to enhance soft-tissue and bone healing by delivering supra-physiological concentrations of autologous platelets at the site of tissue damage.
These preparations may provide a good cellular source of various growth factors and cytokines, and modulate tissue response to injury.
Common clinically available materials for blood preparations combined with a two-step centrifugation protocol at 280g each, to ensure cellular component integrity, provided platelet preparations which were concentrated 2-3 fold over total blood values.
Costs were shown to be lower than those of other methods which require specific equipment and high-cost disposables, while safety and traceability can be increased.
PRP can be used for the treatment of wounds of all types including burns and also of split-thickness skin graft donor sites, which are frequently used in burn management.
The procedure can be standardized and is easy to adapt in clinical settings with minimal infrastructure, thus enabling large numbers of patients to benefit from a form of cellular therapy.


Abstract
Criminal attacks by burns on women in Jordan are highlighted in this retrospective study carried out of all proved cases of criminal burns in female patients treated at the burn unit of the Royal Rehabilitation Center in Jordan between January 2005 and June 2012.
Thirteen patients were included in our study, out of a total of 550 patients admitted, all in the age range of 16-45 yr.
The mean hospital stay was 33 days and the mortality rate was 3/13, i.e. 23%.
Violence against women exists in Jordanian society, yet burning assaults are rare.
Of these, burning by throwing acid is the most common and most disfiguring act, with a higher mortality rate in domestic environments.


Abstract
Cognitive remediation (CR) for schizophrenia is a learning-based behavioural skills training intervention designed to enhance neuro and (or) social cognitive skills, with the ultimate goal of generalization to improve psychosocial outcomes.
This review summarizes conceptual approaches to CR for schizophrenia and the evidence for efficacy in clinical research settings.
In response to these issues, 3 prominent research trends have emerged: the rise of a new generation of computerized restorative cognitive training, the integration of CR with skills training to promote generalization, and the application of techniques to enhance motivation and learning during CR.
As data on the neural basis of learning in people with schizophrenia become available, new technologies that harness the ability of the brain to make sustainable, functional changes may be integrated within a therapeutic context that promotes a personalized approach to learning.
The development of transportable and scalable methods of CR that maximize the ability of people with schizophrenia to improve cognition will help them achieve personal goals for recovery.


Abstract
People with mood disorders experience cognitive impairments that are predictive of functional disability.
Cognitive remediation (CR) is an empirically validated intervention that is designed to remediate neurocognitive deficits and improve functioning.
Our review aims to examine the profile and magnitude of cognitive impairments in mood disorders, review the evidence in support of CR for this population, and discuss future research directions in CR.


Abstract
Careful and accurate diagnosis is essential.


Abstract
Early detection of kidney disease plays a key role in preventing and progression of kidney disease.
Thus, general practitioner can greatly contribute to early recognition and assessment of renal disease.
Proteinuria may be benign or suggestive of glomerular disease.
Patients with persistent proteinuria should be referred to a nephrologist for decisions regarding further management including renal biopsy.
The standard urine dipstick detects only albumin and is not sensitive enough to detect non-albumins.
Estimation of daily protein excretion using the total protein-to-creatinine ratio widely replaced the 24-hour urine measurement.


Abstract
Although bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is common in post-weaning cattle, BRDC prediction models are seldom analyzed.
The objectives of this study were to assess the ability to predict cumulative cohort-level BRDC morbidity using on-arrival risk factors and to evaluate whether or not adding BRDC risk classification and daily BRDC morbidity and mortality data to the models enhanced their predictive ability.
Retrospective cohort-level and individual animal health data were used to create mixed negative binomial regression (MNBR) models for predicting cumulative risk of BRDC morbidity.
Logistic regression models were used to illustrate that the percentage of correctly (within |5%| of actual) classified cohorts increased across days, but the effect of day was modified by arrival weight, arrival month, and feedlot.
Cattle arriving in April had the highest (77%) number of lots correctly classified at arrival and cattle arriving in December had the lowest (28%).
Classification accuracy at arrival varied according to initial weight, ranging from 17% (< 182 kg) to 91% (> 409 kg).
Predictive accuracy of the models improved from 64% at arrival to 74% at 8 days on feed (DOF) when risk code was known compared to 56% accuracy at arrival and 69% at 8 DOF when risk classification was not known.
The results of this study demonstrate how the predictive ability of models can be improved by utilizing more refined data on the prior history of cohorts, thus making these models more useful to operators of commercial feedlots.


Abstract
This study investigated epigenetic mechanisms by which DNA methylation affects the function of bovine adaptive immune system cells, particularly during the peripartum period, when shifts in type 1 and type 2 immune response (IR) biases are thought to occur.
ConA stimulation increased the production of both cytokines before and after parturition.
It decreased DNA methylation in the IFN-γ promoter region but increased for IL-4 promoter region.
Parturition was associated with an increase in IFN-γ production in ConA-stimulated cells that approached significance.
Overall, DNA methylation in both promoter regions increased between the prepartum and postpartum periods, although this did not correlate with secreted cytokine concentrations.
Dexamethasone treated cells acted in a manner consistent with the glucocorticoid's immunosuppressive activity, which mimicked the change at the IFN-γ promoter region observed during parturition.
These results support pregnancy as type 2 IR biased, with increases of IFN-γ occurring after parturition and an increase in IL-4 production before calving.
It is likely that these changes may be epigenetically controlled.


Abstract
A small population of resident T-lymphocytes is present in the normal epidermis of skin from humans, mice, sheep, and cattle.
The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of lymphocytes, CD3+ cells (T-lymphocytes) and CD79a+ cells (B-lymphocytes and plasma cells), in the epidermis and adnexal epithelia of alpacas.
Skin-biopsy specimens from the normal skin of the dorsolateral thorax of 31 alpacas were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for the presence of CD3+ cells and CD79a+ cells in the epidermis and adnexal epithelia.
CD3+ T-lymphocytes, but not CD79a+ cells, were present in the epidermis and adnexal epithelia.
Therefore, in the absence of other signs of inflammation, the presence of lymphocytes in these structures in skin-biopsy specimens should be considered normal.


Abstract
This study aimed to establish the effect of a diet enriched with green-lipped mussel (GLM) on pain and functional outcomes in osteoarthritic dogs.
Motor activity (MA) was continuously recorded in 7 dogs for 12 wk.
Concentrations of plasma omega-3 fatty acids were quantified as indicative of diet change.
Statistical analyses were linear-mixed models and multinomial logistic regression for repeated measures.


Abstract
OCD sufferers generally recognize their obsessions and compulsions as irrational.
Without treatment, OCD often takes a chronic course.


Abstract
Thereafter the ewes were kept together with rams for 60 days, ewes in estrus were recorded and the fertility was assessed after lambing.
Blood progesterone concentration was measured at device application, withdrawal and 14 days later.
Results show that neither treatment nor parity had an influence on estrus rate (Group L 91.7 %, Group K 93.8 %, nulli- and pluriparous animals 96.9 % and 90.8 %, respectively).
In conclusion, the overall lambing rate was higher after long-term compared to short progesterone treatment and nulliparous ewes were less suitable for estrus induction outside the breeding season.


Abstract
The study was conducted in 24 Brown Swiss farms in the Engadine (Swiss mountain region).
In addition, milk recording data of the first 6 milk testing were included in the evaluations.


Abstract
The problem of how to mitigate the impact of pharmaceutical patents on the delivery of essential medicines to the world's poor is as far from being resolved as it has ever been.
Extensive academic commentary and policy debate have achieved little in terms of practical outcomes.
Although international instruments are now in place allowing countries to enact legislation that permits the generic manufacture of patented pharmaceuticals, many countries have not yet enacted appropriate legislation and most of those that have yet to make use of it.
One major problem is that the requirements of international instruments and implementing legislation are seen as being so stringent as to be unworkable.
It argues that high-income nations should refocus on their moral obligation to enact appropriate legislative mechanisms and provide appropriate incentives for their use.
Draft legislation currently being considered in Australia is used to illustrate how workable legislative frameworks can be developed.


Abstract
Chronic pelvic pain presents difficulties for women suffering its complex presentation.
It also presents difficulties for clinicians involved in diagnosing and managing the problem.
We review here clinically relevant information related to visceral pathology and its association with peripheral and central aspects of pain hypersensitivity.
We address why surgery appears to be successful in some cases but less than successful in others, and what cautionary indicators should be taken into account.
A categorization of chronic pelvic pain based on our understanding of pain physiology and mechanisms involved is proposed.
The benefits of multidimensional sensory and pain testing in gynaecological care are reviewed.


Abstract
In June 2012, the Canadian House of Commons passed the so-called omnibus budget bill, making several important changes to the governance of assisted reproduction in Canada.
The bill (Bill C-38) was widely criticized for its unwieldy size and rapid passage through Parliament, preventing adequate parliamentary debate and public scrutiny.
In this commentary, we address some of the more significant changes made by Bill C-38 to the regulation of reproductive medicine in Canada.
We identify the benefits and challenges of closing Assisted Human Reproduction Canada, noting that doing so eliminates a much-needed forum for stakeholder consultation in this field.


Abstract
The aim of HIPEC is eradication of microscopic tumor cells after radical surgery.
Perioperative morbidity and mortality are comparable with other major surgical procedures.


Abstract
Hemoptysis is defined as sputum with blood or streaks of blood during a coughing fit.
The list of possible differential diagnoses is long and depends on the origin of the patient.
However, affected patients should be managed as soon as possible by a multidisciplinary team that includes pulmonologists, intensivists/anesthesiologists, interventional radiologists and thoracic surgeons.


Abstract
Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has become an established standard of care in the management of surgical diseases of the spleen.
We review the indications and contraindications for LS as well as preoperative considerations.


Abstract
Asthma is a serious health problem for First Nations and Inuit children.
In children younger than one year of age, asthma needs to be distinguished from viral bronchiolitis, which is unusually common in Canadian Aboriginal children.
In children younger than six years of age, the diagnosis depends on the presence of typical symptoms, the absence of atypical features and the documentation of response to therapy - particularly a rapid, transient response to bronchodilators.
Clients and their families should receive asthma education.
Control should be regularly reassessed at follow-up visits in health centres, with therapy adjusted to the lowest level capable of maintaining good control.


Abstract
First Nations and Inuit Children are disproportionately affected by respiratory infections such as viral bronchiolitis, pneumonia and tuberculosis.
Rates of long-term lung disease following severe respiratory infections early in life, such as bronchiectasis, are also elevated.
In contrast, rates of asthma may be somewhat less than in other Canadian children, although rates of poor asthma control are increased.
Causes for the high rates of infections include poverty, overcrowding, housing in need of major repairs and better ventilation, and increased exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.


Abstract
Aboriginal children's well-being is vital to the health and success of our future nations.
A change that will impact individuals, communities and nations, a change that will last beyond seven generations, is required.
Applying a social determinants of health framework to health inequities experienced by Aboriginal children can create that change.


Abstract
The diagnostic evaluation not later than after six months increases the prospects for a successful allergic evaluation.


Abstract
Correct diagnosis is the main problem at the beginning of Parkinson's disease.
Treatment is symptomatic and begins with levodopa or dopamine agonists, depending on age and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
Deep brain stimulation is an option when a satisfactory mobility cannot be reached without inacceptable side effects.


Abstract
In Switzerland, in 2011, 4463 patients underwent pacemaker implantation.
This review article focusses on basic pacemaker functions, some fundamental remarks on pacemaker therapy and especially indications and pacemaker models.
Very rare indications (congenital heart disease, bradycardia after heart transplantation) are not discussed.

The use of monitoring devices was essential to guarantee adequate management of these complications.


Abstract
All countries seek to improve equity in the use of health services, service quality and financial protection for their populations.
Hence, the pursuit of UHC is relevant to every country.
The unit of analysis for goals and objectives must be the population and health system as a whole.
What matters is not how a particular financing scheme affects its individual members, but rather, how it influences progress towards UHC at the population level.
Concern only with specific schemes is incompatible with a universal coverage approach and may even undermine UHC, particularly in terms of equity.
Conversely, if a scheme is fully oriented towards system-level goals and objectives, it can further progress towards UHC.
Policy and policy analysis need to shift from the scheme to the system level.


Abstract
A major source of limitation to the real effectiveness of antipsychotics is the high rate of patient nonadherence or, more frequently, partial adherence.
Using long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations is likely to reduce the impact of such adherence problems.
Conversely, the use of LAIs in Canada remains low relative to many other jurisdictions.
These are also based on the experience of many clinicians and clinician scientists.
Their application in clinical settings is illustrated in our report through several case examples highlighting the large variation across patients and different phases of illness.
It is recommended that LAIs should be considered as a treatment option for psychotic disorders across all phases, including the first 2 to 5 critical years.


Abstract
Our findings show that women's employment clearly conflicts with childbearing in Italy, while in Poland women tend to combine the two activities, despite the similar difficulties they face.
Overall, our study provides thus foundations for explaining the variation in the relationship between women's employment and fertility in an enlarged Europe.


Abstract
Planning criteria exist but only in general terms and are often inadequate, so the preparation should based principally on experience.


Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) show an increase of prevalence in Switzerland.
Industrialization and urbanisation correlate with an increase of incidence.
IBD are the result of a continuum of interactions between genetic factors, the intestinal microbial flora, the immune system as well as environmental factors.


Abstract
General practitioners take care of most of the affected patients.
Patient management focuses on longer survival and higher quality of life.


Abstract
The medical records for all the patients and the database of the "Clinical Microbiology and Surveillance of Infections" National Information System were reviewed and analyzed to identify the microbial pathogens isolated in our burns Clinic.


Abstract
One of the most common complications worldwide is renal failure.
This article reviews the various aspects of renal failure management in burn patients.
Two different types of renal failures develop in these patients.
A good understanding and an effective assessment of the problem help to reduce both morbidity and mortality in burn management.


Abstract
It results from a complex interplay of various cellular and neuro-humoral changes affecting burn patients.


Abstract
The use of the micrografting technique resulted in 99.8% of the 1:3 (1:2.99 ± 0.09), 93.6% of the 1:4 (1:3.74 ± 0.12) and 93.8% of the 1:6 (1:5.63 ± 0.12) claimed expansion rates, respectively.
In general the surgeons overestimated the achievable expansion rates.
In general the achieved expansion rate was lower than the estimated and claimed expansion rates.


Abstract
Our society has empowered parents to care for their children and take legally binding decisions on their behalf.
One of the areas where such decision making is required is in medical care when a child's health is at stake.
Three cases of child abuse and neglect were identified and reported.
Literature searches were done to identify cases of child abuse in Kuwait using Medline and PubMed.
News of child abuse was searched for using search engines (bbc.co.uk, cnn.com, and foxnews.com).
The British Child Protection Act and the Kuwaiti Criminal Prosecution Code were studied.
Child abuse and neglect exist in Kuwait and are probably underreported.
It is reported that 75% of those responsible for child abuse are the parents.


Abstract
of patients who commit suicide by burning.
Usually these people are suffering from stress and have been diagnosed as mentally ill.
Schizophrenia, depression, and personality disorders are the most frequently diagnosed conditions.
The psychological problems appear to have been overlooked by the family or not to have been presented to them.
The aim of this study is to present the clinical features, characteristics, and outcomes of patients burned during a suicide attempt.
The role of the psychiatrist is important, starting in the emergency room.
The incidence of patients committing self-injury by burning appears to be higher in women burn patients.
Deceased patients usually have a larger extent of burns and a higher incidence of other injuries and require more surgical procedures and longer hospitalization times.
The problems for burn unit staff and qualified psychiatric care are discussed.


Abstract
First described by Ramazzini in his book "De Morbis Artificia Diatriba" in 1700, the effect of cement on the skin was presumed to be due to contact dermatitis.
The first cement burns case was published by Rowe and Williams in 1963.
Cement handling has been found to be responsible for many cases of occupational burns (generally full-thickness) usually affecting a limited TBSA, rarely greater than 5%, with localization especially in the lower limbs.
We describe an unusual case of a self-inflicted cement burn involving 75% TBSA.
A 28-yr-old building worker attempted suicide by jumping into a cement mixer in a truck.
Upon arrival at our burn centre, clinical examination revealed extensive burn (75% TBSA - 40% full-thickness) involving face, back, abdomen, upper limbs and circumferentially lower limbs, sparing the hands and feet.
The patient was sedated, mechanically ventilated, and subjected to escharotomy of the lower limbs in the emergency room.
The following day, the deep burns in the lower limbs were excised down to the fascia and covered with meshed allografts.
Owing to probable intestinal and skin absorption of cement, metal toxicity was suspected and dialysis and forced diuresis were therefore initiated on day 3.
The patient's clinical conditions gradually worsened and he died on day 13 from the multi-organ failure syndrome.


Abstract
On December 5, 2012 a fire broke out in a primary school in Iran, causing injuries to 26 children and two deaths.
The fire came from an oil stove.
Rather than evacuate the classroom and use the fire extinguisher, the teacher attempted to remove the stove itself from the classroom.
During this process an explosion occurred resulting in a haphazard attempt at evacuation.
This tragedy highlights gaps in both the policy and practice of fire safety.
From 2005 to 2012, Iran experienced six large school fires that led to 67 injuries and five deaths.
Five events were related to oil stoves.
About 30% of Iran's classrooms use oil stoves for heating during the winter with 3.4 million students and 150,000 teachers at risk.
Iran's Ministry of Education has mandated that regular training of school personnel in fire safety measures should be organized but no safety officer is tasked to prepare and conduct this training.
Instead, the task is delegated to the Fire Departments, which fall under municipal administrations; however, such departments do not exist in 93% of the rural areas of Iran.
School fires are not unique to Iran.
Similar tragic events have occurred in several middle-income countries (India, Kenya, Russia) over the last decade.


Abstract
The most crucial aspect of an effective disaster response is pre-hospital triage at the scene.
In most major burns disasters, victims mostly have combined trauma burn injuries and form a heterogeneous group with a broad range of devastating injuries.
Are these victims primarily burn patients or trauma patients?
Should they be taken care of in a burn center or in a trauma center or only in a combined burns-trauma center?
Who makes the decision?
The present review is aimed at answering some of these questions.


Abstract
Malignant lesions in the human breast, prostate, thyroid and lymph nodes show significantly reduced elasticity.
No significant associations with contrast-enhanced ultrasound results were found.
Real-time elastography, therefore, does not appear a useful tool for the differentiation of splenic nodules in the dog.


Abstract
Pododermatitis is a worldwide problem in captive flamingos.
A scoring system was used to determine the prevalence and types of lesions and severity.
Cracks and nodules developed as early as 3 months of age and papillomatous growths as early as 6 to 7 months of age in captivity.
Nodules with ulceration occurred significantly more often in birds older than 31 years and heavier than 4 kg.
None of the free-ranging flamingos, which live on a muddy underground, showed any lesion.
This study demonstrates that flooring, weight and age are important in the onset and progression of pododermatitis in flamingos.

This paper reviews the story of two childhood friends, Dr. Wm.
Lloyd Stackhouse and Dr. Robert E.


Abstract
The objective of the present study was to determine whether it is possible to consistently and reliably teach medical students and resident learners how to administer local anesthetics in an almost painless manner.
The learner then independently administered the anesthesia to the next patient who then scored the learner's ability to inject the local anesthetic from a pain perspective.
The teaching technique is demonstrated in an accompanying online video.
The learners were consistently capable of administering local anesthetics with minimal pain.
During the injection process, the patients only felt pain once ('hole-in-one') 76% of the time.
This pain was attributed to the first 27-gauge needle poke.
The other 24% of the time, patients felt pain twice (eagle) during the 5 min injection process.
All 25 patients rated the entire pain experience to be less than 2/10.
Eighty-four per cent of the patients indicated that the experience was better than local anesthetic given at the dentist's office.


Abstract
Increased spending and reduced funding for health care is forcing decision makers to prioritize procedures and redistribute funds.
Additionally, the five steps in undertaking a cost-utility (effectiveness) analysis are outlined.


Abstract
A healthy young man presented three days after suffering a punch to the face resulting in minimally displaced mandibular fractures.
History revealed an episode of anterograde amnesia and a delayed episode of dysphonia.
Apart from the fractured mandible, the physical examination was otherwise noncontributory.
Imaging revealed severe luminal narrowing of the left cervical internal carotid artery distal to the carotid bifurcation, consistent with carotid dissection; and two focal hypodensities in the left frontal and parietal cortices, highly suggestive of acute secondary embolic infarcts.
The patient was treated with systemic anticoagulation for three months and experienced no further neurological symptoms.
His mandibular fractures, treated conservatively, healed without any complications.
Angiographic imaging is essential for the diagnosis and classification of injury characteristics (eg, type, location, etc).
Treatment must be considered on an individual patient basis depending on the presentation, grade and morphology of the lesion.


Abstract
A 54-year-old woman presented to the emergency department 24 h after undergoing abdominal liposuction, bilateral breast augmentation and facial fat grafting at a private plastic surgery clinic.
She presented with the classic evolution of a bowel perforation secondary to abdominal liposuction.
A computed tomography (CT) scan found free air in her abdominal cavity.
Based on the CT scan and the persistent pain experienced by the patient, an abdominal laparatomy was urgently performed.
A jejunum perforation was found and was treated with a resection of the affected segment followed by intestinal anastomosis.
The patient had a successful recovery and was discharged seven days later.
The present article also reviews the classical presentation of a bowel perforation following abdominal liposuction.


Abstract
Upper eyelid loading with a gold weight is a generally well-tolerated procedure that helps reduce corneal exposure in patients with lagophthalmos.
Complications of this procedure are infrequent.
The authors present a rare case of a noninfectious inflammatory response to an eyelid gold weight implant in a 48-year-old woman and summarize all previously published cases.
This particular patient presented with incomplete left eyelid closure secondary to a trauma.
Although rare, this reaction poses a serious management issue, because it does not respond to antibiotics or short-term steroid use and, in most cases, requires removal of the gold implant.


Abstract
An important alternative to free tissue transfer in patients requiring correction of soft tissue chin defects are local and regional flaps, such as the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and deltopectoral flap.
The use of an expanded deltopectoral flap for a staged reconstruction of the chin in a patient with cancer recurrences, concomitant resections, radiation and multiple reconstructions is reported.


Abstract
Giant fibrolipomas involving the upper extremities are rare tumours.


Abstract
Intraneural lipomas of the ulnar nerve or its branches are rare benign tumours.
In the majority of cases these tumours can be enucleated without damage to the nerve fibres.


Abstract
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly evolving, potentially fatal infection.
Current recommendations advocate antibiotic administration and early aggressive surgical debridement.
Aggressive surgery is associated with significant morbidity, leaving patients with substantial tissue loss and complex wounds.
A case of suspected necrotizing fasciitis treated with minimal surgery is described.
A previously healthy 48-year-old man presented with increased erythema, swelling and blistering of his left upper extremity.
Despite a benign systemic clinical presentation, the hand and forearm were suspicious for necrotizing fasciitis, prompting surgical treatment.
Surgical exploration found a significant amount of intradermal and subdermal clear fluid.
It was decided to limit the amount of debridement.
The diagnosis was Wells syndrome, eosinophilic cellulitis.
Treated with steroids, the wounds healed uneventfully.
It is important to consider the complete clinical picture before aggressive surgical treatment.
A negative history for diabetes, atypical clinical presentation and benign operative findings are suggestive of a more benign diagnosis.


Abstract
Diagnosing latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) in dialysis patients is complicated by poor response to tuberculin skin testing (TST), but the role of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in the dialysis population remains uncertain.
Seventy-nine patients were recruited to compare conventional diagnosis (CD) with the results of two IGRA tests in a dialysis unit.
IGRA testing identified 22 (QuantiFERON Gold IT, Cellestis, USA) and 23 (T-spot.
TB, Oxford Immunotec, United Kingdom) LTBI patients.
IGRA and CD correlated moderately (κ=0.59).
IGRA results correlated with history of TB, TB contact and birth in an endemic country.
TST was not helpful in identifying LTBI patients in this population.
The tendency for IGRAs to correlate with risk factors for TB, active TB infection and history of TB argues for their superiority over TST in dialysis patients.
There was no superiority of one IGRA test over another.


Abstract
The patient was cured completely after reoperation.


Abstract
Abdominal and pelvic structures were only minimally inflamed, as was the appendix.
Peritoneal fluid and blood cultures both grew pure cultures of GAS.
The patient's course was complicated by streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
She fortunately made a full recovery.
The present report highlights the diagnostic and treatment dilemmas associated with GAS primary peritonitis.


Abstract
Malignant breast masses are very rare, mostly fibroadenoma or cysts are found.


Abstract
One hour later, the same sites of one hand were injected with phentolamine (1 mg in 1 mL), and the other hand was injected with saline.
Phentolamine consistently and reliably reversed adrenaline-induced vasoconstriction in the finger.


Abstract
Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the source of substantial workers' compensation claims in industrialized countries.
Its pathogenesis, however, continues to be questioned.
Sixty-seven plastic surgeons were asked to read a clinical scenario and respond whether they would support a WCB claim for CTS.
Provincial WCB offices were contacted and asked to provide statistics surrounding CTS claims for 1997 to 2001.
Fifty-eight per cent (39 of 67) of surgeons surveyed felt that CTS should be covered as a WCB claim, while 42% (28 of 67) felt that it should not be covered by WCB.
In British Columbia, 50% (six of 12) of surgeons were in support of the claim compared to 92% (11 of 12) of those from Alberta, 55% (17 of 31) of those from the Central Provinces and 42% (five of 12) of those from the Maritime Provinces.


Abstract
Typically, it affects a single site.
The present report describes three patients with scrotal EMPD.
Based on literature search, the etiopathology, diagnosis and management of these lesions is discussed.
Reconstructive options, with special emphasis on scrotal lesions, are also discussed.


Abstract
A 35-year-old patient presented with a minimally displaced jaw fracture with normal occlusion.
The occupational therapist easily fabricated this splint for a second patient, who also found it very helpful.


Abstract
Radial artery catheter fracture is a very rare complication.
A review of the English language literature revealed only one reported case.


Abstract
Nasal reconstruction requires a good aesthetic outcome because the nose is located in the centre of the face.
Two problems commonly occur after reconstruction of the nose: abnormal appearance of the new nose, and nasal airway obstruction.
The nasal dorsum should be treated as a separate unit.
The authors believe that the distant V-Y plasty is an effective alternative to the current techniques in reconstruction of the nasal dorsum.


Abstract
Sarcopenia is an age-related generalized loss of muscle mass and muscle strength resulting in low physical performance.
It can be observed in up to 50% of >80 year old men and women.
Sarcopenia is strongly linked to frailty and causes physical disability, falls and institutionalization.
If gait speed is below 0,8 m/s, further diagnostics are indicated.
Muscle mass can be assessed for instance by using DEXA (Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry), Muscle strength with the "Handgrip Strength Test" and physical performance using a clinical test survey ("Chair Stand Test").
Studies showed that the best way to improve sarcopenia is the combination of power or high velocity resistance training with leucin-rich protein supplementation.


Abstract
Recent advances in cancer therapy have resulted in an increased number of long-term cancer survivors.
Infertility, however, might be the consequence of an efficient cancer treatment.
For young patients affected by cancer accesses to the partly established and partly still experimental options to preserve fertility are crucial.
Due to the complexity of the topic a multidisciplinary approach considering experts' recommendations is indispensable.

Abstract
The incidence of obesity in Canada is increasing.
Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a relatively new and effective procedure for weight loss.
Delayed complications include strictures, nutritional deficiencies and gastresophageal reflux disease.
We discuss the principles involved in the management of each complication.


Abstract
The current study tested the benefit of commercially available spray-dried bovine colostrum (The Saskatoon Colostrum Company, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) in raising snatch-farrowed, porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pigs.
In experiment 1, 12 SF-pCD pigs received a liquid diet composed mainly of bovine colostrum from birth to day 10; 6 remained on the same liquid diet (COL), and the other 6 were fed a diet composed mainly of milk replacer (RPL) until weaning.
In experiment 2, 12 SF-pCD pigs were fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning; after weaning, 6 were fed a starter diet containing 20% (w/w) bovine colostrum powder (STARTER-COL), and the other 6 were fed a starter diet without any bovine colostrum (STARTER-CTRL) until termination (day 42 or day 49).
In experiment 1 the COL pigs had significantly fewer fever-days than did the RPL pigs.
In experiment 2 diarrhea, typhlocolitis, and pancreatic degeneration developed in 4 of the STARTER-COL pigs after weaning.
In both experiments all the pigs fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning survived until termination.
All pigs tested free of swine influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine parvovirus.
In experiment 2 all the pigs tested free of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but some in both groups tested positive for Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2.
In conclusion, with the use of snatch-farrowing and bovine colostrum, pigs can be raised in the absence of porcine maternal antibodies with 100% survival and freedom from most porcine pathogens of biologic relevance.
This model is potentially suitable for animal disease research.


Abstract
Seventy-eight critically ill calves between 1 and 13 days old were selected from 1 farm.
For each assay 4 models were built: without covariates, with age, with age and clinical covariates (infection and dehydration status), and with age and laboratory covariates (fibrinogen concentration and packed cell volume).


Abstract
In aerobiology, dose-response studies are used to estimate the risk of infection to a susceptible host presented by exposure to a specific dose of an airborne pathogen.
By definition, quantification of viable airborne pathogens is based on the culture of micro-organisms, but some airborne pathogens are transmissible at concentrations below the threshold of quantification by culture.
In this paper we present an approach to the calculation of exposure dose at microbiologically unquantifiable levels using an application of the "continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model" and the validation of this approach using rhodamine B dye as a surrogate for aerosolized microbial pathogens in a dynamic aerosol toroid (DAT).


Abstract
The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of 3 levels of supplemental xylooligosaccharides (XOS) from straw on the growth performance, endocrine metabolism, and immune response of broiler chickens.
Day-old, healthy Arbor Acres broilers (n = 192) received a basal diet of maize-soybean meal and, depending on the group to which they were allocated, no additive (control group) or the following experimental treatments for 59 d: treatment 1: 5 g XOS/kg; treatment 2: 10 g XOS/kg; and treatment 3: 20 g XOS/kg.


Abstract
Oxidative stress is a key component in the immunosuppression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and neutrophil function may be impaired by oxidative stress.
Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured with a spectrophotometer and commercial reagents, superoxide production with a hydroethidine probe, and the viability and apoptosis of neutrophils with capillary flow cytometry and the annexin V-PE system.


Abstract
Abundant lymphocyte infiltration is frequently found in canine malignant mammary tumors, but the pathological features and immunophenotypes associated with the infiltration remain to be elucidated.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to characterize the highly elevated levels of clotting factor VIII (FVIII) in camel plasma.
Whole blood was collected from healthy camels and factor VIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) assays were conducted using both the clotting and the chromogenic techniques.
The anticoagulant citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) produced the highest harvest of FVIII:C, the level of plasma factor VIII, compared to heparin:saline and heparin:CPDA anticoagulants.
Camel FVIII can be concentrated 2 to 3 times in cryoprecipitate.
There was a significant loss of camel FVIII when comparing levels of FVIII in camel plasma after 1 h of incubation at 37°C (533%), 40°C (364%), and 50°C (223%).
Thrombin generation of camel plasma is comparable to that of human plasma.
It was concluded that camel plasma contains very elevated levels of FVIII:C, approaching 8 times the levels in human plasma, and that these elevated levels could not be attributed to excessive thrombin generation.
Unlike human FVIII:C, camel FVIII:C is remarkably heat stable.
Taken together, these unique features of camel FVIII could be part of the physiological adaptation of hemostasis of the Arabian camel in order to survive in the hot desert environment.


Abstract
The present report describes a case involving a 16-year-old girl with oligomenorrhea who was found to have celiac disease and liver cirrhosis of unknown etiology.
Subsequent evaluation revealed cardiac dysfunction consistent with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, a rare finding in the paediatric population.
This patient's unusual presentation permits an exploration of several conditions uncommonly reported in conjunction with celiac disease.


Abstract
Growth monitoring is an essential part of paediatric health care, from birth through adolescence.
Growth and nutritional problems often occur between 18 months and three years of age.


Abstract
The majority of children between one and five years of age who are brought in by their parents for refusing to eat are healthy and have an appetite that is appropriate for their age and growth rate.
Unrealistic parental expectations may result in unnecessary concern, and inappropriate threats or punishments may aggravate a child's refusal to eat.
A detailed history and general physical examination are necessary to rule out acute and chronic illnesses.
A food diary and assessment of parental expectations about eating behaviour should be completed.
Where the child's 'refusal' to eat is found to be related to unrealistic expectations, parents should be reassured and counselled about the normal growth and development of children at this age.


Abstract
Diabetic Nephropathy is the most common cause of end stage renal disease in Western countries.
An increased urinary albumin excretion represents a characteristic sign of diabetic kidney damage.
Regular screening for microalbuminuria allows early detection and timely intervention.
In overt diabetic nephropathy, quantification of albuminuria helps monitoring disease progression.
Therapeutic interventions to reduce albuminuria retard progression of nephropathy and reduce cardiovacular mortality, since albuminuria represents an independent cardiovascular risk factor.
This review article describes the natural history of diabetic nephropathy and discusses practical issues for the measurement of albuminuria.
Available prophylactic and therapeutic measures, particularly glycemic control and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, are reviewed using an evidence based approach.


Abstract
Nevertheless, a correct diagnosis is required to exclude other pathologies.
In addition to neurogenic causes other urological differential diagnoses can be clarified and treated.
If diagnosis of benign prostatic syndrome is confirmed, various medical and surgical treatment options are available.

Abstract
Esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis is a rare pathology whose etiology is unknown, but which is frequently associated with three highly prevalent entities: esophageal reflux disease, esophageal candidosis and alcoholic esophagitis.
With conservative treatment the course of these pathologies is usually benign.
However, some severe cases are resistant to conservative treatment and may require more aggressive management.


Abstract
For our investigation 16 bitches of different breeds with an average age of 9.7 years were used.
They have been presented to the clinic due to different gynecological symptoms.
The leading symptom was in 87.5 % of the cases a chronic vaginal secretion.
In addition to a detailed anamnesis a clinical examination was performed including vaginalcytologic, sonographic, hematologic and hormonal findings (progesterone P4, 17β estradiol E2).
As basic diagnoses could be made: Cycle aberrations (n = 8), pyometra endometritis complex (n = 4), vaginal tumor (n = 4).
In addition 3 patients were presented with alopecia.
All patients were ovariohysterectomized without prior conservative treatment and the ovaries histologically examined and classified.
Based on sonographic findings before and macroscopic evaluation the ovaries after surgery, the OCS could be divided into an oligocystic and polycystic syndrome.
There were predominating (94 %) follicle theca cysts.
Based on present data the diagnosis of OCS of the bitch by means of peripheral P4 and E2 values is not possible.


Abstract
Trilostane is used to treat dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH).

Abstract
The diagnosis had been confirmed by the detection of specific anti-Leishmania antibodies and/or Leihmania-DNA.
22 dogs had clinical signs (skin lesions, lameness or lack of fitness) and 9 dogs were asymptomatic but showed abnormal laboratory parameters.
Under treatment with allopurinol the symptoms disappeared within 1 - 5 months in 20 dogs.


Abstract
Recently, neuroimaging-based diagnoses and clinical predictions derived from machine learning analysis have shown significant potential for clinical translation.
This review introduces the key concepts of this approach, including how the multivariate integration of patterns of brain abnormalities is a crucial component.
We survey recent findings that have potential application for diagnosis, in particular early and differential diagnoses in Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia, and the prediction of clinical response to treatment in depression.
We discuss the specific clinical opportunities and the challenges for developing biomarkers for psychiatry in the absence of a diagnostic gold standard.
We propose that longitudinal outcomes, such as early diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, offer definite opportunities for progress.
We propose that efforts should be directed toward clinically challenging predictions in which neuroimaging may have added value, compared with the existing standard assessment.
We conclude that diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers will be developed through the joint application of expert psychiatric knowledge in addition to advanced methods of analysis.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is primarily characterized by decreased affect and accompanying behavioural consequences, but it is also associated with cognitive dysfunction.
Assessment of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and associated event-related potentials (ERPs; derived from averaged EEG activity in response to a stimulus) in the context of MDD has provided insights into the electrocortical abnormalities associated with the disorder.
Importantly, EEG and ERPs also have emerged as candidates for predicting and optimizing antidepressant (AD) treatment outcome.
This is critical in light of relatively low remission rates or a limited response to initial AD interventions.
In contrast to other neuroimaging approaches, EEG and ERPs may be superior for predicting and monitoring AD response, as electrocortical measures are relatively inexpensive, easy to use, and have excellent temporal (that is, millisecond) resolution, enabling fine-grained assessment of basic cognitive and emotive processes.
This review aims to highlight the most consistently noted EEG and ERP features in MDD, which may one day assist with diagnostic confirmation, as well as the potential clinical utility of specific electrocortical measures in aiding with response prediction.


Abstract
The risk of sexually transmitted infections that accompanies sexual relations and the risk of death and morbidity associated with pregnancy have long been recognized and have stimulated major control efforts that are finally yielding positive results.
Much less attention has been focused, however, on how experiences in early life can affect women's health in adulthood.
Breast and cervical cancers kill more women than any other types of cancer in all parts of the developing world.
In most of Asia and Latin America and some African countries, deaths from these two forms of cancer now outnumber pregnancy-related deaths.


Abstract
Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a widespread bovine pathogen capable of causing disease affecting multiple body systems.
Previous studies have shown 2-(2-benzimidazolyl)-5-[4-(2-imidazolino)phenyl]furan dihydrochloride (DB772) effectively prevents BVDV infection in cell culture.
The aim of this project was to assess the efficacy of DB772 for the prevention of acute BVDV infection.
Four calves seronegative to BVDV were treated with DB772 and another 4 calves were treated with diluent only on the same dosing schedule.
Each calf was subsequently challenged intranasally with BVDV.
Virus was isolated consistently from untreated calves on days 4 to 8, while treated calves remained negative by virus isolation during this period.
Azotemia was exhibited by all treated calves on day 4 resulting in the euthanasia of 1 calf on day 10 and the death of another on day 13.
Virus was isolated from the 2 remaining treated calves on day 14 or 21.
On day 21, both remaining treated calves and all 4 untreated calves had anti-BVDV antibody titers > 1:2048.
This pilot study indicates that DB772 temporarily prevented acute disease due to BVDV, but carries a significant concern of renal toxicity.

Abstract
Septic synovitis is a potentially debilitating and life-threatening disorder in horses.
We hypothesized that a universal bacterial real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay would have improved sensitivity and decreased turn-around time for detection of bacteria in synovial fluid (SF) samples.
Forty-eight SF samples were collected from 36 horses that presented to two referral institutions with suspected septic synovitis.
Universal RT-PCR, bacterial culture and SF analysis were performed on all samples, and an interpretation on the sample being septic or not was derived by three board certified specialists from the history, clinical assessment and SF characteristics.
RT-PCR results were compared to a composite standard comprised of positive culture and interpretation by all three specialists of samples as "septic".
For 41 of 48 samples (85%), culture and RT-PCR results were concordant.
Compared to the composite standard, 83% of samples were correctly classified by RT-PCR (turn-around time of approximately 4 hours).
Relative sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were 87% and 72% respectively, and 56% and 86% for culture.
Hence, universal RT-PCR was a rapid and highly sensitive test, which may accelerate diagnosis and improve outcome for horses with septic synovitis.


Abstract
Most of the metabolic diseases of dairy cows occur within the first 2 wk after calving, and cows with a metabolic disease are prone to infectious diseases.
Although metabolic diseases are generally recognized as a risk factor for infectious diseases owing to the associated decrease in immune function, the difference in immune status between cows with milk fever (MF) or displaced abomasum (DA) during the lactation period has not been clarified.
Therefore, the peripheral blood leukocyte populations in 38 multiparous Holstein cows from 1 herd were analyzed after calving.


Abstract
The efficacy of a piglet-specific inactivated Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccine was evaluated with clinical field trials, as recommended by the Republic of Korea's Animal, Plant & Fisheries Quarantine & Inspection Agency.
Three farms were selected on the basis of their history of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
On each farm 60, 1-week-old pigs were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups: vaccination at 1 and 3 wk of age or no vaccination.
The 2-dose schedule of vaccination with inactivated PCV2 vaccine improved the average daily weight gain from birth to 16 wk of age, the PCV2 load in the blood, and the frequency and severity of lymph node lesions.
Inactivated PCV2 vaccine seems to be very effective in controlling PCV2 infection under field conditions.

Abstract
Although the early benefits of endoscopic carpal tunnel release have been demonstrated, there is great controversy regarding the risks and safety of the technique.
The present study reports early major complications in a series of 1278 consecutive cases performed by a single surgeon over a seven-year period.
All procedures were performed under local anaesthesia on an outpatient basis using the Agee single portal technique.
Mean follow-up was three months.
No vascular, tendon or permanent nerve injuries were documented.
Recurrent or persistent symptoms occurred in 7% of patients for which 20 of 89 underwent subsequent open carpal tunnel release.
No nerve injuries were found on re-exploration.
Other complications were consistent with previously reported incidences.
This is the largest reported case series by a single surgeon and represents an accumulation of surgical experience at the upper end of the learning curve.
Endoscopic carpal tunnel release is a safe procedure in this experienced single surgeon series.


Abstract
A total of 84 consecutive patients were included and were divided into two groups (42 in each group) according to the recipient vessels.
The overall vessel thrombosis rate was 6% (five of 84 cases) and the overall flap loss rate was 2.4% (two of 84 cases) yielding a flap salvage rate of 60%.
Vessel thrombosis occurred in three cases of the smaller vessels group and in two cases of the large cervical vessels group.
This was not statistically significant.

Abstract
Lymphangioma is a rare benign proliferative lymphatic lesion that appears in chronic lymphedematous states in a variety of settings.
Lymphangioma circumscriptum consists of clinically thin-walled, translucent vesicles appearing in groups most commonly located on the axilla, chest, mouth, and tongue.
A 12-year-old male patient had been suffering from itching, pink-red colored, translucent vesicular lesions overlying the anterior axilla since birth.
The lesions had slowly grown in size and number over the years.
The patient had no history of trauma, or cellulites.
The physical examination revealed clusters of pink-red colored vesicles, which released a clear exudate when punctured.
The lesion was 50×120 mm in size.
Histopathological examination revealed slight epidermal acanthosis and enlarged lymph in the upper dermis, impinging directly onto the epidermis.
These lymphatics were lined only by endothelium.
The lower dermis and sub-cutis contained abnormally large muscle-coated vessels containing a proteinaceous fluid.
Six months later, there was no recurrence and a cosmetically and functionally acceptable postoperative result was obtained.


Abstract
Multiple techniques exist to evaluate the poorly projecting chin, but most are imprecise when it comes to choosing the proper implant size.
This choice is further complicated by the impracticality of commercially available chin implants.
The present paper discusses a new approach to precise sizing of the chin implant, based primarily on the degree of chin convexity (curvature of the chin pad) in the profile view.
Examples of mentoplasties performed using the chin convexity principle are presented.

Abstract
The use of ketamine as an intravenous sedation agent has enjoyed some popularity, but this has been far from universal.
Its reputation for producing psychological sequelae such as nightmares, flashbacks and schizophrenic-like reactions have made many anesthesiologists and plastic surgeons reluctant to use this drug.
The authors' experience using a ketamine/diazepam protocol with approximately 11,400 patients since 1971 at the Cosmetic Surgery Hospital in Woodbridge, Ontario is presented.
The methodology consists of intravenous diazepam followed with low-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg to a maximum of 40 mg) 2 min later.
This provides the surgeon with a period of profound amnesia to allow for infiltration of the local anesthetic.
It is this local anesthetic delivered during the dissociative state that provides prolonged analgesia throughout the surgery.
The patient is maintained throughout the procedure with increments of diazepam and midazolam.
This protocol is found to be effective, reliable and reproducible, and the experience of the patient and plastic surgeon has been overwhelmingly favourable.

The diagnosis was made from the patient's symptoms and radiographs.


Abstract
Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening, fulminant disease that is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.
Presenting with a triad of findings including progressive erythema, severe dermatological edema and severe pain disproportionate to the physical findings, this disease is a surgical emergency.
Delayed diagnosis and surgical debridement lead to higher mortality.
Early extensive surgical debridement, aggressive antibiotic therapy, invasive monitoring and intensive care management determine the outcome in most cases.
In patients who fail to demonstrate clinical improvement, profound sepsis and its sequela -systemic inflammatory response - have frequently been implicated.
It is these patients that need to be carefully re-evaluated for 'hidden' foci of infection that may be the real cause of the patient's decline.
Once detected, these occult foci can be surgically debrided, resulting in dramatic improvement.


Abstract
The extensor tendons to the index, long, ring and small fingers are motored by the common extensor digitorum communis muscle body.
Improper management of this clinical entity may lead to an abnormal pathomechanical kinematic chain imbalance.
Early identification and treatment is critical to address this entity appropriately.


Abstract
The most frequently used method in two-stage reconstruction of a tendon is the placement of a silicone rod, forming a canal where the tendon can glide easily, that is subsequently replaced with a tendon graft.
In the present report, the authors evaluated the effects of tetracycline on the time period required for the formation of a qualified gliding canal in rats after the placement of a silicone rod.
Tetracycline was administered through an 18 gauge needle inserted into the silicone rod in the test side (right) and saline solution was administered in the same fashion to the control side (left) in each rat.
Histopathological and macroscopic examinations at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 after the operation showed that a significantly thicker and more mature sheath was formed after two weeks in the sides that had been treated with tetracycline.


Abstract
Capsular contracture is one of the major complications of augmentation mammaplasty.
Each patient received a pair of smooth saline-filled implants (Mentor, USA) placed in the submuscular space through an inframammary incision.
In all operated breasts, many of the known measures commonly used for capsular contracture prevention were implemented.
As well, a dependent drain was used as the final hemostatic step to prevent blood accumulation in the pocket.

Abstract
A case of a 67-year-old man with recurrent basal cell carcinoma of the nasal tip and an incidental symptom of epiphora (volunteered by the patient) is presented.
Epiphora is an abnormal overflow of tears that fail to drain into the inferior nasal meatus via the nasolacrimal system.
Within the differential diagnosis of epiphora and nasolacrimal obstruction is neoplasm - primary, secondary or metastatic.
On further investigation, including computed tomography imaging, he was subsequently found to have invasive disease extending along the left embryological cleavage plane superiorly to the medial canthal tendon.
An excision attempt using Mohs technique by the dermatological surgeon was unsuccessful in adequately clearing the margins, and revealed a diagnosis of morphea-like basal cell cancer.
This failure, taken together with the extent of disease identified by computed tomography scan, resulted in significant alteration of the operative approach.
The patient underwent extensive tumour extirpation and nasal reconstruction using a forehead flap.
The present case alerts surgeons involved in the management of skin cancers to the importance of the anatomical relationship of the nasolacrimal apparatus to embryological soft tissue cleavage planes when dealing with recurrent and aggressive lesions.
In addition, it serves as a reminder to inquire about the signs and symptoms associated with nasolacrimal obstruction.
Moreover, when preparing for surgical excision of recurrent aggressive basal cell carcinoma, high-quality imaging is essential to tailor the operative plan.

Abstract
Risk-based surveillance is becoming increasingly important in the veterinary and public health fields.
It serves as a means of increasing surveillance sensitivity and improving cost-effectiveness in an increasingly resource-limited environment.
Our approach for developing a tool for the risk-based geographical surveillance of contagious diseases of swine incorporates information about animal density and external biosecurity practices within swine herds in southern Ontario.
The objectives of this study were to group the sample of herds into discrete biosecurity groups, to develop a map of southern Ontario that can be used as a tool in the risk-based geographical surveillance of contagious swine diseases, and to identify significant predictors of biosecurity group membership.
A subset of external biosecurity variables was selected for 2-step cluster analysis and latent class analysis (LCA).
It was determined that 4 was the best number of groups to describe the data, using both analytical approaches.
The authors named these groups: i) high biosecurity herds that were open with respect to replacement animals; ii) high biosecurity herds that were closed with respect to replacement animals; iii) moderate biosecurity herds; and iv) low biosecurity herds.
The risk map was developed using information about the geographic distribution of herds in the biosecurity groups, as well as the density of swine sites and of grower-finisher pigs in the study region.
Finally, multinomial logistic regression identified heat production units (HPUs), number of incoming pig shipments per month, and herd type as significant predictors of biosecurity group membership.


Abstract
The objectives of this study were to determine the analgesic and motor effects of a high-volume intercoccygeal epidural injection of bupivacaine at 2 concentrations in cows.
A prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover trial was conducted on 6 adult cows.
An indwelling epidural catheter was placed in the first intercoccygeal space and advanced 10 cm cranially.
All the cows received 3 treatments with a washout period of 48 h: saline (control), 0.125% bupivacaine (high dose), or 0.0625% bupivacaine (low dose), at a final volume of 0.15 mL per kilogram of body weight, infused manually into the epidural space over a period of 15 min.
The anal and tail tone and motor deficits of the pelvic limbs were evaluated in 5 of the cows with use of a numerical rating scale and a visual analogue scale (VAS).
Sensory block was assessed in 4 of the cows by the response to needle pricks in different regions with the use of a VAS.
Measurements were obtained before and at different time points after injection, up to 360 min.
Analysis of variance for repeated measures and post-hoc Tukey's and Dunnett's tests were used.
Differences were considered significant when the P-value was ≤ 0.05.
One cow became recumbent 6 h after injection.
Anal and tail tones were significantly decreased and motor deficits of the pelvic limbs were significantly increased after bupivacaine treatment compared with control treatment.
The overall mean VASpain scores ± standard deviation were 66 ± 8 after control treatment, 52 ± 5 after low-dose bupivacaine treatment, and 43 ± 5 after high-dose bupivacaine treatment.
The pain scores were significantly lower in caudal regions up to the saphenous nerve after high-dose bupivacaine treatment compared with control treatment and significantly lower in the anus, vulva, and tail after low-dose bupivacaine treatment compared with control treatment.
Thus, analgesia with moderate motor deficits of the pelvic limbs may be obtained with 0.125% bupivacaine administered epidurally.


Abstract
The objectives of this study were to determine if percutaneous lung biopsy can be used to characterize early pathologic changes in bovine lung associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD), to determine if specific infectious respiratory pathogens can be identified in association with these changes, and to determine whether pulmonary pathology at arrival and at the time of initial diagnosis are associated with health and production outcomes.
One hundred auction-market derived crossbred steer calves from a commercial feedlot in southern Alberta were included in this study.
A percutaneous lung biopsy technique was used to obtain lung samples from the right middle lung.
Steers were sampled 295 times yielding 283 samples with 210 (74%) containing lung tissue.
Overall, histopathological changes were observed in 20 (9.5%) of lung biopsy samples.
There were too few samples with pathology to reveal an association between lung pathology and subsequent health events.
In general, percutaneous lung biopsy can be done safely on feedlot steers in a commercial feedlot setting with few clinical side effects.
This technique did not prove useful as a diagnostic tool or prognostic indicator for early BRD.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a concentrated combination of tiletamine-zolazepam [TZ, 0.53 mg/kg body weight (BW)], ketamine (Ket, 0.53 mg/kg BW), and detomidine (Det, 0.04 mg/kg BW) in the immobilization of free-range cattle for clinical procedures.
The combination was administered intramuscularly to 53 animals.

Abstract
The objectives of this study were to establish a reference interval for canine cerebrospinal fluid lactate (CSFL) and to compare CSFL and plasma lactate (PL) concentrations in anesthetized dogs with and without intracranial disease.
Dogs were anesthetized for the procedures using different anesthetic protocols.
The CSFL reference interval [90% confidence interval (CI) for lower and upper limits] was 1.1 (1.0 to 1.2) to 2.0 (2.0 to 2.1) mmol/L.


Abstract
A sandwich-dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot ELISA) was developed for the detection of canine distemper virus (CDV).
In 56 dogs suspected to have CD the rates of detection of CDV antigen in samples of blood lymphocytes and palpebral conjunctiva by dot ELISA and ELISA were, respectively, 91% (49/54) and 81% (44/54) for the lymphocyte samples and 88% (28/32) and 75% (24/32) for the conjunctival samples.
The CDV detection limits were 10 ng/50 μL for dot ELISA and 40 ng/50 μL for ELISA.
The results indicate that the dot ELISA developed can serve as a reliable rapid diagnostic test in suspected cases of CD and also be useful for epidemiologic surveillance of the disease.


Abstract
A needle-free delivery system was assessed as a route for providing quick, safe, and effective vaccination against avian influenza (AI).

Abstract
For each of two years, at the beginning of period 1 (mid-December), 72 beef cows, calving in January or February, were assigned to diets supplemented with roasted flaxseed (Flax) or roasted soybean (Soybean).
For each of two years, after 11 wk (end of period 1), 18 cows of 36 in the Flax group were switched to the soybean supplement and 18 cows of 36 in the Soybean group were switched to the flax supplement (start of Period 2).
Cows were bred by timed artificial insemination (TAI) in week 5 of period 2.
The FA composition of the milk reflected the FA profile of the oilseed supplements.
There were no differences in pregnancy rates among the 4 groups.

Abstract
Heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; HFpEF) is a common type of heart failure in the elderly, and it typically represents advanced hypertensive heart disease.
The left ventricle in patients with HFpEF is characterized by concentric remodeling, normal LVEF, but reduced left longitudinal shortening, and importantly diastolic dysfunction.
Dyspnoe and fatigue in patients with HFpEF are due to impaired left ventricular filling with a rapid increase in filling pressures and the lack of an increase in stroke volume during exercise.
The diagnosis of HFpEF requires the careful exclusion of non-cardiac causes of dyspnoe as well as cardiac causes of dyspnoe associated with preserved LVEF other than HFpEF, primarily coronary artery disease and valve disease.
In contrast to patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF there is still no established treatment for patients with HFpEF, which prolongs survival or reduces the rate of hospitalizations for heart failure.
There is currently however intense research going on in this field, and results from large trials evaluating the effects of various interventions on clinical endpoints are expected within the next years.

Abstract
It is generally agreed among burn care specialists that pruritus (itching) is a very common and distressing complication of burn injuries that results in extreme discomfort.
There is no consensus on treatment modality worldwide but there are generally accepted methods of managing amelioration.
This survey aims to study the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Nigerian burn specialists who manage various degrees of burn injuries in our environment.
The purpose is to find out whether there are any uniform modalities of care for these patients, with the view of possibly providing standardization.
To this end, a structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to plastic surgeons from across Nigeria.
Findings showed that 88.6% of the plastic surgeons had no form of assessment tool or method for evaluating post-burn pruritus, leaving only 11.4% believing they had a method of assessing the severity of post-burn pruritus.
85.7% of these plastic surgeons and burn care specialists did not have any form of anti-pruritic regimen, as only 14.3% indicated having this.
Hence, there is no standardization in the management of pruritus in Nigeria and there is an urgent need for a management protocol.


Abstract
The epidemiological pattern and risk factors of burns and burn infections varies widely in different parts of the world.
This study aims to determine the epidemiologic pattern of burn injuries and possible risk factors associated with burn infections in burn units of Gaza strip hospitals.
A total of 118 patients were included in the study.
The data collected included: patient age and gender, the causes, site, degree, and TBSA of the burns, as well as surgical operations, length of hospital stay, and microbiological profile of samples collected from patients, the environment, and from health care staff.
Pediatric and adult patients accounted for 72% and 28% respectively.
58.5% of all patients were male and 41.5% were female.
The most common etiological factors in children were scalding, while in adults these were open fire and flammable liquids.
The mean TBSA was 12% with a range from 1-90%.
Second and third degree burns accounted for 78% and 22% respectively.
The area of the body most often affected was the torso (39%), followed by the lower limb (29.7%), and upper limb (17.8%).


Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most common organisms associated with infections among burn patients and has shown a frequent and rapid development of antibiotic resistance.
The presence of genes encoding aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) and tetracycline resistance were detected by PCR and multiplex-PCR.
Among the 151 S. aureus isolates recovered from the burn patients, 96 (63.6%) were detected to have mecA gene.
The rate of tetracycline resistance genes associated with mecA was 61% (92/151).
Most of the strains which harboured the mecA gene also contained the tet and AME genes.


Abstract
Traumatic injury resulting in isolated dysfunction of the hypoglossal nerve is relatively rare and described in few case reports.
We present a patient with isolated unilateral palsy of the twelfth cranial nerve (CN XII) resulting from recurrent airway intervention following extensive burn injuries.
The differential diagnosis for paralysis of the CN XII is also discussed herein.
This case illustrates the significance of comprehensive diagnostic evaluation and the need for refined airway manipulation in patients that require multiple endotracheal intubations.

Abstract
Collagen based dressings for acute burn wound management have been extensively used in India, particularly in the city of Chennai.
Due to the high levels of humidity in our city, closed dressings become infected and treatment with topical antimicrobials, like Silver Sulfadiazine cream, quickly become desiccated.
Collagen membrane dressings were manufactured by the biomaterial laboratory of the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Government of India in Chennai, and then the process was patented.
Collagen was extracted from bovine skin and Achilles tendons, and then reconstituted.
This was used on burn wounds as dressings after clearance from the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committees of the Hospital and CLRI.
Continued research in this field to enable resulted in the design of silver sulphadiazine loaded alginate microspheres which were embedded in the reconstituted collagen.
Controlled delivery of silver sulphadiazine.
This collagen membrane was used in chronic infected burns.
Low molecular weight heparin was given subcutaneously to improve wound healing in burn injuries and collagen membrane dressings were also applied.
After several trials the process technology was patented.
The advantages and disadvantages of the collagen membrane cover is elaborated in a group of 487 pediatric burn patients.
The trial was conducted at the burn unit of Kanchi Kamakoti Childs Trust Hospital (KKCTH) in Chennai, India.

Fads in psychiatry are little more than bad ideas with short half-lives.
They have arisen because of the great discontinuities that have swept psychiatry unlike other specialties in the 20th century: the transition in the 1920s from asylum-based biological psychiatry to psychoanalysis, and the transition in the 1960s from psychoanalysis to a biological model based on psychopharmacology.
In no other medical specialty has the knowledge base been scrapped and rebuilt, and then again scrapped and rebuilt.
In these great transitions, when psychiatry each time has had to reconstruct from scratch, bad ideas have crept in with good.
Psychiatry, in its heavy use of consensus conferences, is often unable to employ science as a means of discarding fads, which, once installed, are often difficult to remove.
Only when psychiatry becomes firmly linked to the neurosciences will its subjugation to the turbulence of faddism be moderated.


Abstract
The main reason is that mental illness is poorly understood and can be difficult to treat.
Most diagnostic fads have involved the extension of well-known categories into broader spectra.
The best antidote to fads is a commitment to evidence-based psychiatry.


Abstract
Concurrently, a NSAID should be administered intravenously (ketoprofen, 3 mg/kg of bodyweight) and Tetanus-serum subcutaneously (off label use).
The toxic dose of 4 mg lidocaine/kg BW (corresponds to 1 ml lidocaine 2 % per lamb of 5 kg BW) should not be exceeded.
Concurrently, a NSAID (off label use) and Tetanus-serum should be administered systemically.
Immunization against GnRH represents an animal-friendly and economically feasible alternative to rubber ring castration.
With two immunizations at an interval of 3 - 4 weeks testicular development can be inhibited for at least 3 months and the onset of puberty clearly delayed.
However, a specific vaccine for use in ruminants is currently registered neither in Switzerland nor in Europe.


Abstract
Additionally, 45 cases transmitted by the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre in Zürich were processed.

Abstract
The medical care and evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease before valve surgery, but also the post-operative treatment is complex and managed by general practitioners, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons.
In this mini-review we will first discuss the preoperative assessment of the two most common valvulopathies, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.


Abstract
It is clinically important to recognize both bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD) in patients seeking treatment for depression, and it is important to distinguish between the two.
We reviewed the most studied question on the relationship between BPD and bipolar disorder: their diagnostic concordance.
Across studies, approximately 10% of patients with BPD had bipolar I disorder and another 10% had bipolar II disorder.
Likewise, approximately 20% of bipolar II patients were diagnosed with BPD, though only 10% of bipolar I patients were diagnosed with BPD.
While the comorbidity rates are substantial, each disorder is nontheless diagnosed in the absence of the other in the vast majority of cases (80% to 90%).
In studies examining personality disorders broadly, other personality disorders were more commonly diagnosed in bipolar patients than was BPD.
Likewise, the converse is also true: other axis I disorders such as major depression, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder are also more commonly diagnosed in patients with BPD than is bipolar disorder.
These findings challenge the notion that BPD is part of the bipolar spectrum.

Psychopathy is a developmental disorder marked by emotional deficits and an increased risk for antisocial behavior.
Dysfunction within the amygdala's role in reinforcement learning and the role of ventromedial frontal cortex in the representation of reinforcement value is stressed.


Abstract
Linking psychoanalytic studies with neuroscience has proven increasingly productive for identifying and understanding personality functioning.
This article focuses on pathological narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), with the aim of exploring two clinically relevant aspects of narcissistic functioning also recognized in psychoanalysis: fear and decision-making.
Attention can play a crucial role in moderating fear and self-regulatory deficits, and the interaction between experience and emotion can be central for decision-making.
Understanding the processes and neurological underpinnings of fear and decision-making can potentially influence both the diagnosis and treatment of NPD.

Abstract
We review critical trends in imaging genetics as applied to schizophrenia research, and then discuss some future directions of the field.
The results of many studies support this assumption, most of which show single genetic variants to be associated with changes in activity of localized brain regions, as determined by select cognitive controlled tasks.
The genetic association approaches applied to imaging genetics have also progressed to more sophisticated multivariate effects, including incorporation of two-way and three-way epistatic interactions, and most recently polygenic risk models.
Imaging genetics is a unique and powerful strategy for understanding the neural mechanisms of genetic risk for complex CNS disorders at the human brain level.


Abstract
The term "brain (or neural) oscillations" refers to the rhythmic and/or repetitive electrical activity generated spontaneously and in response to stimuli by neural tissue in the central nervous system.
The importance of brain oscillations in sensory-cognitive processes has become increasingly evident.
This review discusses methods such as evoked/event-related oscillations and spectra, coherence analysis, and phase locking.
It gives examples of applications of essential methods and concepts in bipolar disorder that provide a basis for fundamental notions regarding neurophysiologic biomarkers in cognitive impairment.
The take-home message is that in the development of diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic strategies, neurophysiologic data should be analyzed in a framework that uses a multiplicity of methods and frequency bands.


Abstract
Neural oscillations at low- and high-frequency ranges are a fundamental feature of large-scale networks.
Recent evidence has indicated that schizophrenia is associated with abnormal amplitude and synchrony of oscillatory activity, in particular, at high (beta/gamma) frequencies.
These abnormalities are observed during task-related and spontaneous neuronal activity which may be important for understanding the pathophysiology of the syndrome.
In this paper, we shall review the current evidence for impaired beta/gamma-band oscillations and their involvement in cognitive functions and certain symptoms of the disorder.
In the first part, we will provide an update on neural oscillations during normal brain functions and discuss underlying mechanisms.
This will be followed by a review of studies that have examined high-frequency oscillatory activity in schizophrenia and discuss evidence that relates abnormalities of oscillatory activity to disturbed excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance.
Finally, we shall identify critical issues for future research in this area.


Abstract
Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder of unknown cause or characteristic pathology.
Clinical neuroscientists increasingly postulate that schizophrenia is a disorder of brain network organization.
In this article we discuss the conceptual framework of this dysconnection hypothesis, describe the predominant methodological paradigm for testing this hypothesis, and review recent evidence for disruption of central/hub brain regions, as a promising example of this hypothesis.


Abstract
The brain's default network is a set of regions that is spontaneously active during passive moments.
The network is also active during directed tasks that require participants to remember past events or imagine upcoming events.
One hypothesis is that the network facilitates construction of mental models (simulations) that can be used adaptively in many contexts.
Nonetheless, some intriguing recent findings suggest that dysfunctional interactions between front-oparietal control systems and the default network contribute to psychosis.
Psychosis may be a network disturbance that manifests as disordered thought partly because it disrupts the fragile balance between the default network and competing brain systems.


Abstract
In the course of development, the brain undergoes a remarkable process of restructuring as it adapts to the environment and becomes more efficient in processing information.
A variety of brain imaging methods can be used to probe how anatomy, connectivity, and function change in the developing brain.
Here we review recent discoveries regarding these brain changes in both typically developing individuals and individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.
We begin with typical development, summarizing research on changes in regional brain volume and tissue density, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and functional connectivity.


Abstract
Progress in the understanding of normal and disturbed brain function is critically dependent on the methodological approach that is applied.
Both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are extremely efficient methods for the assessment of human brain function.
FMRI is an indirect measurement of neural activity and based on hemodynamic changes, and offers high spatial resolution.


Abstract
Burns in young infants have long been recognized as a potential cause of nonaccidental injury.


Abstract
These injuries commonly result from a fall from an elevated surface or an overturning of the CRS.
The incidence of death from these events, however, is not well documented.
Two such fatalities were identified.
In both instances, infants had been placed in a CRS overnight and, in both cases, the CRS was found overturned, resulting in asphyxiation.
The history and pathological findings of both cases are summarized.

Abstract
An unusual case of a patient who presented with a subcutaneous soft tissue lesion of the back is described.
The patient had no preceding history of cutaneous malignancy or local trauma.
Excision of the lesion revealed a diagnosis consistent with basal cell carcinoma with deep infiltration.
The site was re-excised with a generous margin to ensure complete removal.
There has been no recurrence for 18 months.
This case is presented to underscore the rarity and importance of its existence.

Abstract
The most common standardized cup size was seven, representing bra sizes 34 F, 36 E, 38 D, 40 C, etc.
The range of preoperative cup sizes was five (34 D) to 17 (42 L).
The mass of tissue removed from each breast was averaged for each patient and ranged from 147 g to 2453 g (mean 522 g).


Abstract
Significant adhesions and scarring around the median nerve can render it relatively ischemic.
A number of vascular flaps have been described to provide vascular coverage in attempts to decrease further cicatricial adhesions and to improve local blood supply around the median nerve.
The anomalous muscle was distal to the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon and inserted in the palmar fascia on the ulnar aspect of the hand.
Referring branches from the ulnar artery provided vascular supply to the anomalous muscle.
The muscle on these vascular pedicles was transposed over the median nerve, providing good, stable, unscarred coverage.
The patient had an excellent result with resolution of the carpal tunnel symptoms.

Abstract
A one-stage procedure to reconstruct complete and incomplete unilateral/bilateral cleft lip and nose deformities is presented.
No dental or orthodontic treatment was available or performed in this older population.
Emphasis was on primary closure of the muscles, using the rotation advancement principle.
The repair that was performed was near anatomical, reconstructing the labial sulcus, the nostril floor, the alveolar cleft and the nasal deformity all in one stage.
There was a high level of satisfaction both from the patient's and surgeon's point of view.


Abstract
Exteriorization of the vascular pedicle of a reverse radial forearm flap allows a greater arc of movement of the flap for more distal coverage, and avoids the potential vascular compromise of tunnelling under a tight skin bridge.
Two-stage transfer of a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap on a wrist carrier pedicle may be useful in circumstances when local recipient vessels are inadequate for free flap transfer.
Although both of these vascular pedicle modifications have drawbacks, they may be of value in limited circumstances.
Their advantages and limitations are discussed.


Abstract
This headrest can also be used during reconstruction of the neck.


Abstract
One of the most important functions of skin is thermoregulation.
The alterations in the patterns of blood flow in skin is one of the main physiological processes responsible for thermoregulatory control.
The mechanisms governing the thermoregulatory control of cutaneous blood flow are mainly neural and chemical in nature.
At present, there is a lack of studies in the literature looking at the relationship between reinnervation and the blood flow pattern of skin grafts.
The present study uses Laser Doppler flowmetry and the immunohistochemical stains protein gene product 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P to identify nerve fibres, and antibodies to CD31 and von Willebrand factor to identify endothelial tissues.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the patterns of blood flow and nerve tissue regeneration in split-skin grafts up to 15 years following the original procedure.
Thirty-two split-skin grafts were studied and these were placed into two groups based on the nature of the bed of excision: group I consisted of patients who underwent tangential excision and split-skin grafting (n=17), and group II consisted of patients with split-skin grafts placed onto fascial beds (n=15).
Each subpopulation of patients was further divided into three groups based on the length of time following grafting: one to three years, four to six years and seven to 15 years.
These divisions were arbitrarily chosen and called A1, A2 and A3, respectively.
In the Laser Doppler flowmetry arm of the study, the grafts were assessed at various stages after heating, cooling and further reheating.
The Laser Doppler flowmetry studies showed that, on subjecting the skin grafts in both groups I and II to heating and cooling followed by reheating, the overall response of the blood flow to changes in the temperature was slower.
The immunohistochemical analysis showed that in all graft types and graft ages, protein gene product 9.5, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P stains demonstrated a relative lack of the presence of nerve fibres in the split-skin grafts compared with the control ('normal' skin).
However, von Willebrand factor and CD31 immunological staining demonstrated that vessels were present in the split-skin grafts, with no significant difference in size or quantity from the control samples.


Abstract
The operative procedure frequently used to narrow the nasal pyramid in the context of a regular rhinoplasty is well known to all rhinoplastic surgeons.
It consists of hump removal, followed by lateral osteotomies and medialization of the nasal bones.
The present article describes a simplified approach to the 'nasal plateau resection', a technique that allows the creation of an open nasal roof, without hump removal and without compromising dorsal projection.
This permits the medialization of the lateral nasal bones and the subsequent narrowing of the wide pyramid, while preserving the height of the nasal dorsum as viewed in profile.


Abstract
The authors outline the principles of local anesthesia, surgeon-controlled tourniquet techniques, and a number of new instruments which allow a surgeon to work in comfort and safety, unassisted.
There are significant cost savings and efficiency when hand procedures are undertaken in the emergency and outpatient clinic settings.


Abstract
Because of the severe damage to the soft and bony tissues, the reconstructive options are very limited.
Healing was uneventful at two-year follow-up, with superior patient satisfaction.
Nasal dorsum skin expansion should be considered as an option in the reconstruction of moderately sized soft tissue deficits of the nose.


Abstract
Necrotizing soft tissue infections are often associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Early surgical excision along with antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of management.
Salvage of these extremities is often difficult due to loss of soft tissues, tendons, nerves and blood vessels.
Skin grafting of the granulating wound is the common method of closure in these patients.
Use of various flaps has improved reconstructive options in these extremities.
A case of salvage of upper extremity using a groin flap following extensive debridement is reported.


Abstract
In a three-phase trial, the anesthetic properties of lidocaine, bupivacaine and ropivicaine were compared in carpal tunnel release surgery.
In phase I, two groups of 25 sequential patients were injected with either lidocaine plain 2% or lidocaine 2% with adrenaline 1:100,000 (E), as the local anesthetic for outpatient carpal tunnel release surgery.
Subjective injection pain, postoperative pain at 2 h increments and the number of analgesic pills taken were recorded.
Postoperative pain scores and analgesic pills taken were compared using nonparametric statistical tests.
During the first 4 h there was a slight benefit in the duration of the anesthetic and fewer pain pills were used in the bupivacaine group.
Phase III was a randomized double-blind comparison of ropivicaine and lidocaine E 2% in 72 patients.
There was a slight decrease in pain scores and fewer analgesic pills required during the first 6 h in the ropivicaine group.
Lidocaine plain 2% provided significantly inferior analgesic and anesthetic properties compared with lidocaine E 2%, bupivacaine or ropivicaine.
Sequential randomized comparisons between lidocaine E and bupivacaine and ropivicaine showed clinical equivalence.
The present study showed lidocaine E 2% to be a satisfactory and comparatively cost-effective anesthetic for outpatient carpal tunnel surgery.


Abstract
Surgical managment of soft tissue loss in the wrist consists of suitable coverage for the protection of vascular, nervous and tendinous structures.
The fasciocutaneous cubital flap covers wrist defects, providing safe support over the nerves, tendons and vessels.
Reported here is five cases of wrist defects by different etiology (extravasations, autolysis, trauma and neuritis).
A fasciocutaneous cubital flap successfully covered the soft tissue loss in all cases.
This flap is applied in an easy, one-stage procedure and it maintains the major arteries of the forearm.


Abstract
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and biologically aggressive neuroendocrine tumour of the skin.
Recent analysis of a surveillance, epidemiology and end results program has shown a statistically significant increase of 8% per year in the age-adjusted rates for MCC of the skin over the past 15 years.
MCC commonly presents as a painless, rapidly growing, single red or purple cutaneous nodule.
Diagnosis is often delayed until histopathological examination due to the relative rarity of the disease.
MCC-specific immunohistochemical markers are available for definitive diagnosis, including anticytokeratin-20-positive stain and thyroid transcription factor-1-negative stains.


Abstract
Acute median nerve compression usually occurs from increased pressure within the compartments.
During tissue expansion of the forearm, the interstitial pressure increases, which usually decreases following the relaxation of tissue.
Clinical diagnosis of acute neuropathy is usually made from the history and clinical signs and symptoms.

Abstract
False positives arise when people without disorders are diagnosed as having disorders.
Various approaches for avoiding false positives have been suggested.
This review critically assesses the roles of zones of rarity, the threshold problem (the problem of determining the boundary of disorder in cases that shade into normality), and the
The lack of zones of rarity in much of psychiatry gives rise to the threshold problem.
The DSM harm criterion is frequently presented as offering a solution to the threshold problem.
However, I argue that the harm criterion cannot offer a general solution to the threshold problem, as harm is not always correlated with the intensity and frequency of symptoms.
Still, the harm criterion is essential to ensure that people who are merely different are not diagnosed as having a disorder.
The threshold problem can be addressed by selecting symptom-based cut-off points to distinguish between disorder and normality.
These cut-off points are frequently arbitrary in the sense that they often reflect no natural division between disorder and normal, but they may be more or less wisely chosen.
Where possible, the thresholds should be set so that the advantages of diagnosis can be expected to outweigh the disadvantages.


Abstract
Criticisms of psychiatry for overdiagnosing, for pathologizing normality, are not new, dating at least from the antipsychiatry critiques in the 1960s.
It is proposed in this In Review paper that a useful and valid principle for use in these debates is the tight conceptual linkage between illness and distress and impairment of day-to-day functioning.
This linkage is fundamental to the conceptualization of mental disorder in the DSM-IV and can still serve to reduce overdiagnosis by excluding cases where distress and impairment are absent or minimal.
The same conceptual linkage provides a way of understanding how conditions may warrant a diagnosis even though they are not associated with current distress or impairment, namely, if they carry risk for such in the future.
For these conditions, assessments of costs and benefits of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis depend crucially on high-quality, replicated data on the sensitivity and specificity of the early diagnostic test.


Abstract
The In Review articles in this issue on normality and disorder by Dr Rachel Cooper and Dr Derek Bolton explore the importance of a value component of harm in the concept of mental disorder.
As Dr Bolton argues, harm in the form of distress or role impairment has always been intimately tied to the concept of disorder and treatment decisions; as Dr Cooper argues, without the harm requirement, any disliked anomaly may be labelled a disorder.
Moreover, as Cooper argues, a harm requirement is not incompatible with a natural kinds approach to distinguishing among disorders or to a categorical approach to disorder; the lack of zones of rarity on the harm continuum does not preclude categorical underlying causal processes.
However, neither paper systematically develops arguments regarding the other component of disorder, the requirement that the harm must be caused by underlying dysfunction.
The dysfunction component distinguishes disorders from the many other negative conditions in life.
Cooper's identification of dysfunction with symptom severity ignores the fact that normal suffering can be severe, and Bolton's attempt to encompass risk of harm within harm yields an implausibly expansive conception of disorder.
While the harm component is essential, clarification of the dysfunction component of the concept of disorder, pursued in part 2 of this In Review in the December 2013 issue, is also essential to establishing a coherent and plausibly limited domain of psychiatric disorder within the broader arena of harmful conditions.


Abstract
The human genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain 20 000-25 000 genes.
Monogenic diseases are caused by disturbances in a single gene, and currently only targeted diagnostic testing is available following a specific clinical suspicion.
Chromosomal disorders usually involve multiple genes, so that the symptoms are often less specific.
In Switzerland, specific legal principles and ethical guidelines must be taken into account.

Abstract
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1:5000 people.
Typical manifestations affect the cardiovascular system, eyes, skeleton, lungs, skin and dura mater.
Most patients have a so-called marfanoid habitus with tall stature, long and narrow limbs, a long and narrow head shape and other skeletal abnormalities.
However, the most dangerous complication is acute dissection of the ascending aorta, which is usually the result of a slowly progressive aortic dilatation.
With the introduction of therapies the average life expectancy of previously just 32 years could be raised to above 60 years.

Abstract
Negative suction drainage is commonly used for the prevention of seromas or hematomas in auricular reconstruction surgery; however, there are few reports regarding the quantitative measurement of negative suction and its relation to disposed time, patient age or microtia type.
In the present study, the authors recorded the volume of suction exudate in microtia reconstruction and elaborate on the relevant details of controlling negative suction.
A negative suction drainage system was applied in 96 microtia patients between 2007 and 2010.
Two small polyethylene drains were inserted adjacent to the concha and the scapha, respectively.
The volume of exudate was recorded for three days after surgery and was analyzed according to disposed time, patient age and microtia type.
The drains were removed on the third postoperative day, when only a small amount of exudate remained.
A significant change in drainage was observed over three days postoperatively, and the quantity decreased progressively on the third postoperative day.
Comparison of age groups showed that the volume of drainage from adults was greater than that from children or adolescents in the first two postoperative days, regardless of whether the drains were inserted in the scapha or concha.
No statistical differences were found on the third postoperative day.
A comparison of drain types revealed no statistically significant differences between scapha and concha drains three days postoperatively.
The analysis demonstrated that drainage quantity is related to disposed time and patient age, but not to microtia type.
The authors recommend removal of suction drains on the third postoperative day.
Moreover, individualized negative suction treatment according to age or microtia type provides a safe and consistent approach to achieving acceptable results and fewer complications.


Abstract
Commonly, the operated skin tends to rebuild scar in the area of surgery.
Assuming local ischemia as an etiological factor, two cases in which topical nitroglycerin was used following surgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease are presented.
In these patients, no raised scar formation developed during healing.
At least six months after surgery, disease recurrence was not noted and the patients and surgeon reported improved skin quality.
In the present study, the use of topical nitroglycerin, a local vasodilator, appeared to prevent recurrent scar formation, possibly through prevention of local ischemia.
Further study and follow-up is necessary.

Abstract
In Canada, the status of CF transition has not been previously reported.
The aim of the present study was to describe the transition from paediatric to adult health care for CF patients in Canada, specifically: availability of adult CF clinic services; average age of transfer from paediatric to adult CF health care; and existing CF transition practices.
Results show that access to appropriate adult CF health care in Canada is universal; however, the availability, quantity and quality of CF transition care vary among CF clinics.
Over a four-year period, the number of CF clinics using formal transition protocols almost doubled, but more work remains to be performed.

Abstract
Amid numerous complications that plague the health and quality of life of people living with HIV, neurocognitive and psychiatric illnesses pose unique challenges.
While there remains uncertainty with respect to the pathophysiology surrounding these disorders, their adverse implications are increasingly recognized.
Left undetected, they have the potential to significantly impact patient well being, adherence to antiretroviral treatment and overall health outcomes.
Adequate understanding and usage of these screening mechanisms can ensure effective use of resources by distinguishing patients who require referral for more extensive diagnostic procedures from those who likely do not.

Abstract
The present article addresses the use of antiviral drugs in the management of seasonal influenza illness for the 2012/2013 season.
It updates the previous document published in 2011 (1).
Noteworthy guidance updates since 2011 include the following: Seasonal influenza in 2012/2013 is predicted to be caused by two human influenza A and one influenza B strain, all of which are anticipated to remain generally susceptible to oseltamivir.
The predicted strains are A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (Yamagata lineage).
All are included in the seasonal influenza vaccine and are susceptible to oseltamivir.
Swine-variant H3N2v, which has rarely caused infection in humans exposed to infected swine within the past year in the United States, is susceptible to oseltamivir.
It is not included in the current seasonal influenza vaccine.
It is still considered that initiation of antiviral therapy more than 36 h to 48 h after onset of symptoms is beneficial in patients hospitalized with complicated influenza and severe illness.
Oseltamivir continues to be recommended for the treatment of influenza in pregnant women.
The use of antiviral drugs among measures to control outbreaks of influenza in closed facilities such as correctional institutions is now included in the present document.


Abstract
44 % of the visited farmers administered analgetics during anaesthesia or less than 10 minutes before castration.
14 % of the piglets were insufficiently anaesthetised (moving or vocalising) and 18 % showed stronger bleeding tendency after castration.
The mortality rate was less than 0.1 %.
22 % of the swine farmers reported headache or dizziness during or after castration work.
The Isoflurane level on 2 farms was above the Swiss safety limits.
The time needed for castration was with 4.3 minutes clearly above the time necessary without anaesthesia.
The additional financial costs and time are at the moment not adequately compensated to the farmers.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to describe the practical implementation of the painless castration under injection anaesthesia in Switzerland.
30 swine farms were visited and 60 farmers answered a questionnaire.
The anaesthesia may be improved by using butorphanol in addition to the combination of ketamine and azaperone.
Increased bleeding can be controlled by using an emasculator.

Abstract
Results were then compared to adult Taekwondo Olympic athletes in 2000, 2004 and 2008.
Data on 96 Taekwondo athletes were obtained from the official Youth Olympic website.
A LOGIT analysis was performed on the following six independent variables: height, body mass, body mass index, gender, techniques used to score, and warnings obtained during a match.
The study did find some differences between winners and non-winners for males and female, although none of the differences were statistically significant.
Consequently, training personnel may enhance winning potential of Taekwondo competitors by focusing on offensive versus defensive techniques and improving the quality of punching.


Abstract
Chronic recurrent mutlifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an extremely rare skeletal disorder in the younger population.
It presents with multifocal bony lesions that often mimic more sinister diagnoses such as infection or neoplasm.
The cause of this condition remains unknown and there is limited evidence on effective treatments.
In this case, a 13-year-old female athlete presented to a sports chiropractic clinic with non-traumatic onset of right ankle pain.
After failed conservative management, radiographs and MRI were obtained exhibiting a bony lesion of the distal tibia resembling osteomyelitis.
The patient was non-responsive to antibiotics, which lead to the diagnosis of CRMO.
CRMO should be considered as a differential diagnosis for chronic bone pain with affinity for the long bones of the lower extremity in children and adolescents.
The role of the primary clinician in cases of CRMO is primarily that of recognition and referral for further diagnostic investigations.

Abstract
There have been advances in the cognitive-affective science of human categorization, and it is timely to consider implications for our understanding of the category of psychiatric disorder.
The category of mental disorder has graded boundaries, and conditions within this category can be conceptualized using MEDICAL or MORAL metaphors.
One key set of constructs used in MEDICAL metaphors relates to the notion of dysfunction, and it may, in turn, be useful to conceptualize such dysfunction in evolutionary terms.
Rational arguments can be brought to bear to help decide whether particular entities should be included in our nosologies, and, if so, what their boundaries should be.
The perspective here can be illustrated using many nosological debates within the anxiety disorders and the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, including the question of delineating normal from abnormal anxiety, of deciding whether anxiety is psychiatric or medical, and the debate about the optimal meta-structure for anxiety disorders.


Abstract
According to the introduction to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), 5th edition, each disorder must meet the definition of a mental disorder, which requires the presence of harm and dysfunction.
Constructing criteria sets to require harm is relatively straightforward.
However, establishing the presence of dysfunction is necessarily inferential because of the lack of knowledge of internal psychological and biological processes and their functions and dysfunctions.
Given that virtually every psychiatric symptom characteristic of a DSM disorder can occur under some circumstances in a normally functioning person, diagnostic criteria based on symptoms must be constructed so that the symptoms indicate an internal dysfunction, and are thus inherently pathosuggestive.
In this paper, we review strategies used in DSM criteria sets for increasing the pathosuggestiveness of symptoms to ensure that the disorder meets the requirements of the definition of mental disorder.
We propose that future revisions of the DSM consider systematic implementation of these strategies in the construction and revision of criteria sets, with the goal of maximizing the pathosuggestiveness of diagnostic criteria to reduce the potential for diagnostic false positives.


Abstract
Early life adversity is associated with long-tem impacts on behaviour and physical and mental health.
The mechanisms mediating the impact of early life environment on the phenotype are proposed to involve a change in the state of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and, as a consequence, in the stable programming of gene expression.
Recent studies suggest that the changes in DNA methylation affect broad genomic regions, as well as peripheral tissues in addition to brain regions.
Although the data are still scarce, it points to the possibility that DNA methylation is a mechanism of genome adaptation to signals from early life social environment.
This modulation of the DNA methylation pattern is proposed to result in long-term impact on the phenotype that could become maladaptive under certain contexts later in life.
This model has implications on our understanding of behavioural and mental health pathologies, as well as their diagnosis and therapeutics.


Abstract
The maldistribution of health workers between urban and rural areas is a policy concern in virtually all countries.
It prevents equitable access to health services, can contribute to increased health-care costs and underutilization of health professional skills in urban areas, and is a barrier to universal health coverage.
To address this long-standing concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued global recommendations to improve the rural recruitment and retention of the health workforce.
This paper presents experiences with local and regional adaptation and adoption of WHO recommendations.
It highlights challenges and lessons learnt in implementation in two countries - the Lao People's Democratic Republic and South Africa - and provides a broader perspective in two regions - Asia and Europe.
At country level, the use of the recommendations facilitated a more structured and focused policy dialogue, which resulted in the development and adoption of more relevant and evidence-based policies.
At regional level, the recommendations sparked a more sustained effort for cross-country policy assessment and joint learning.
There is a need for impact assessment and evaluation that focus on the links between the rural availability of health workers and universal health coverage.
The effects of any health-financing reforms on incentive structures for health workers will also have to be assessed if the central role of more equitably distributed health workers in achieving universal health coverage is to be supported.


Abstract
Human resources for health have been recognized as essential to the development of responsive and effective health systems.
Although much has been written about the human resource crisis in the health sector, labour economic frameworks have seldom been applied to analyse the situation and little is known or understood about the operation of labour markets in low- and middle-income countries.
However, this approach neglects other important factors that influence human resource capacity, including labour market dynamics and the behavioural responses and preferences of the health workers themselves.
The premise is that a better understanding of the impact of health policies on health labour markets, and subsequently on the employment conditions of health workers, would be helpful in identifying an effective strategy towards the progressive attainment of universal health coverage.


Abstract
To achieve universal health coverage, health systems will have to reach into every community, including the poorest and hardest to access.
Scaling up and maintaining CHW programmes is fraught with a host of challenges: poor planning; multiple competing actors with little coordination; fragmented, disease-specific training; donor-driven management and funding; tenuous linkage with the health system; poor coordination, supervision and support, and under-recognition of CHWs' contribution.
The current drive towards universal health coverage (UHC) presents an opportunity to enhance people's access to health services and their trust, demand and use of such services through CHWs.
For their potential to be fully realized, however, CHWs will need to be better integrated into national health-care systems in terms of employment, supervision, support and career development.
Partners at the global, national and district levels will have to harmonize and synchronize their engagement in CHW support while maintaining enough flexibility for programmes to innovate and respond to local needs.
Strong leadership from the public sector will be needed to facilitate alignment with national policy frameworks and country-led coordination and to achieve synergies and accountability, universal coverage and sustainability.
In moving towards UHC, much can be gained by investing in building CHWs' skills and supporting them as valued members of the health team.
Stand-alone investments in CHWs are no shortcut to progress.


Abstract
Human resources for health and universal health coverage: fostering equity and effective coverage.
The findings inform key principles for evidence-based decision-making on HRH in support of UHC.
Facing the unprecedented health and development challenges that affect all countries and transforming HRH evidence into policy and practice must be at the heart of UHC and the post-2015 development agenda.
It is a political imperative requiring national commitment and leadership to maximize the impact of available financial and human resources, and improve healthy life expectancy, with the recognition that improvements in health care are enabled by a health workforce that is fit for purpose.


Abstract
Human resources for health (HRH) will have to be strengthened if universal health coverage (UHC) is to be achieved.
Existing health workforce benchmarks focus exclusively on the density of physicians, nurses and midwives and were developed with the objective of attaining relatively high coverage of skilled birth attendance and other essential health services of relevance to the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
However, the attainment of UHC will depend not only on the availability of adequate numbers of health workers, but also on the distribution, quality and performance of the available health workforce.
In addition, as noncommunicable diseases grow in relative importance, the inputs required from health workers are changing.
New, broader health-workforce benchmarks - and a corresponding monitoring framework - therefore need to be developed and included in the agenda for UHC to catalyse attention and investment in this critical area of health systems.
The new benchmarks need to reflect the more diverse composition of the health workforce and the participation of community health workers and mid-level health workers, and they must capture the multifaceted nature and complexities of HRH development, including equity in accessibility, sex composition and quality.


Abstract
Population-based disease prevalence surveys raise ethical questions, including whether participants should be routinely told their test results.
Ethical guidelines call for informing survey participants of any clinically relevant finding to enable appropriate management.
This is aimed at minimizing survey participation bias.
Those who opt out of being given their HIV test results and who do not seek their results miss the opportunity to receive life-saving antiretroviral therapy.
The justification for HIV surveys without routine feedback of results to participants is based on a public health utility argument: that the benefits of more rigorous survey methods - reduced participation bias - outweigh the benefits to individuals of knowing their HIV status.
However, people with HIV infection have a strong immediate interest in knowing their HIV status.
In consideration of the ethical value of showing respect for people and thereby alleviating suffering, an argument based on public health utility is not an appropriate justification.
In anonymous HIV surveys as well as other prevalence surveys of treatable conditions in any setting, participation should be on the basis of routine individual feedback of results as an integral part of fully informed participation.
Ensuring that surveys are ethically sound may stimulate participation, increase a broader uptake of HIV testing and reduce stigmatization of people who are HIV-positive.


Abstract
Oral health is a fundamental component of overall health.
All children and youth should have access to preventive and treatment-based dental care.
Canadian children continue to have a high rate of dental disease, and this burden of illness is disproportionately represented by children of lower socioeconomic status, those in Aboriginal communities and new immigrants.
In Canada, the proportion of public funding for dental care has been decreasing.
This financial pressure has most affected low-income families, who are also less likely to have dental insurance.
Paediatricians and family physicians play an important role in identifying children at high risk for dental disease and in advocating for more comprehensive and universal dental care for children.


Abstract
During the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) asked all Member States to provide case-based data on at least the first 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases to generate an early understanding of the pandemic and provide appropriate guidance to affected countries.
In reviewing the pandemic surveillance strategy, we evaluated the utility of case-based data collection and the challenges in interpreting these data at the global level.
To do this, we assessed compliance with the surveillance recommendation and data completeness of submitted case records and described the epidemiological characteristics of up to the first 110 reported cases from each country, aggregated into regions.
From April 2009 to August 2011, WHO received over 18 000 case records from 84 countries.
Data reached WHO at different time intervals, in different formats and without information on collection methods.
Just over half of the 18 000 records gave the date of symptom onset, which made it difficult to assess whether the cases were among the earliest to be confirmed.
Descriptive epidemiological analyses were limited to summarizing age, sex and hospitalization ratios.
Centralized analysis of case-based data had little value in describing key features of the pandemic.
Results were difficult to interpret and would have been misleading if viewed in isolation.
A better approach would be to identify critical questions, standardize data elements and methods of investigation, and create efficient channels for communication between countries and the international public health community.
Regular exchange of routine surveillance data will help to consolidate these essential channels of communication.


Abstract
Fewer than 20% of patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis are receiving treatment and there is an urgent need to scale up treatment programmes.
One of the biggest barriers to scale-up is the treatment regimen, which is lengthy, complex, ineffective, poorly tolerated and expensive.
For the first time in over 50 years, new drugs have been developed specifically to treat tuberculosis, with bedaquiline and potentially delamanid expected to be available soon for treatment of MDR cases.
However, if the new drugs are merely added to the current treatment regimen, the new regimen will be at least as lengthy, cumbersome and toxic as the existing one.
There is an urgent need for strategy and evidence on how to maximize the potential of the new drugs to improve outcomes and shorten treatment.
We devised eight key principles for designing future treatment regimens to ensure that, once they are proven safe in clinical trials, they will be clinically effective and programmatically practicable.

There is no personalized anticancer treatment without individualized dosing.
Clearly, BSA-based chemotherapy dosing does not improve the substantial pharmacokinetic variability of individual drugs.
Therapeutic drug monitoring and genotyping may allow more individualized dosing of anticancer compounds in the future.


Abstract
The objective of this pilot study was to determine the efficacy of inactivated (1 or 2 dose) and live-attenuated chimeric porcine circovirus (PCV)1-2 vaccines in sows using the PCV2-spiked semen model.
Thirty-five sows were randomly divided into 6 groups: negative and positive controls, 1 dose inactivated PCV1-2 vaccine challenged (1-VAC-PCV2), 2 dose inactivated PCV1-2 vaccine challenged (2-VAC-PCV2), 1 dose live-attenuated PCV1-2 vaccine unchallenged (1-LIVE-VAC), and 1 dose live-attenuated PCV1-2 vaccine challenged (1-LIVE-VAC-PCV2).
The inactivated PCV1-2 vaccine induced higher levels of PCV2-specific antibodies in dams.
All vaccination strategies provided good protection against PCV2 viremia in dams, whereas the majority of the unvaccinated sows were viremic.
Four of the 35 dams became pregnant: a negative control, a positive control, a 2-VAC-PCV2 sow, and a 1-LIVE-VAC-PCV2 sow.
The PCV2 DNA was detected in 100%, 67%, and 29% of the fetuses obtained from the positive control, inactivated vaccinated, or live-attenuated vaccinated dams, respectively.
The PCV2 antigen in hearts was only detectable in the positive control litter (23% of the fetuses).
The PCV1-2 DNA was detected in 29% of the fetuses in the litter from the 1-LIVE-VAC-PCV2 dam.
Under the conditions of this pilot study, both vaccines protected against PCV2 viremia in breeding age animals; however, vertical transmission was not prevented.

Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) of the metacarpophalangeal joint is the most common articular disease in polo ponies leading to early retirement.
A biomarker that would discriminate between pathological and physiological changes secondary to exercise could be helpful in OA prevention.
Nucleated cells, soluble protein, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), glycosaminoglycans (GAG), and urea were measured.


Abstract
Impaired abomasal motility is common in cattle with abomasal disorders.
The macrolide erythromycin has been demonstrated to be an effective prokinetic agent in healthy calves and in adult cattle with abomasal volvulus or left displaced abomasum.
We hypothesized that 2 structurally related macrolides, spiramycin and tulathromycin, would also be effective prokinetic agents in cattle.
Six milk-fed, male, Holstein-Friesian calves were administered each of the following 4 treatments: spiramycin, 75 000 IU/kg BW, IM, this dose approximates 25 mg/kg BW, IM; tulathromycin, 2.5 mg/kg BW, SC; 2 mL of 0.9% NaCl (negative control); and erythromycin, 8.8 mg/kg BW, IM (positive control).
Calves were fed 2 L of cow's milk containing acetaminophen (50 mg/kg body weight) 30 min after each treatment was administered and jugular venous blood samples were obtained periodically after the start of sucking.
Abomasal emptying rate was assessed by the time to maximal plasma acetaminophen concentration.
Spiramycin, tulathromycin, and the positive control erythromycin increased abomasal emptying rate compared to the negative control.
We conclude that the labeled antimicrobial dose of spiramycin and tulathromycin increases the abomasal emptying rate in healthy milk-fed calves.


Abstract
The transverse upper gracilis free flap is a well-described option for breast reconstruction.
The technique is a secondary choice for autologous breast reconstruction because the abdomen remains the primary donor site for breast reconstruction.
However, in appropriately selected patients, the authors believe that the transverse upper gracilis flap remains a reliable flap for breast reconstruction.
Its consistent anatomy, potentially reasonable donor site scar, limited functional morbidity and simultaneous two-team surgical approach make this flap a viable option for many patients.
The technique, however, is not without drawbacks - known numbness of the medial thigh and the potential for chronic lymphedema of the lower leg, contour deformities of the medial thigh, and widening of the medial thigh scar need to be considered.
The current article presents a harvest technique that is reliable, rapid and addresses each of the above-mentioned limitations with specific changes in the traditional technique.
The article provides video documentation of the modified harvest technique using only monopolar cautery for the dissection.

Abstract
There are currently numerous techniques described in the literature that attempt to optimize wound closure following a fasciotomy.
However, primary closure of fasciotomy wounds continues to be difficult to accomplish successfully because of the underlying edema sustained from the compartment syndrome.
The approach described in the present report is simple and physiologically sound, and addresses the underlying pathology.
The authors focus on alleviating edema by strictly elevating the limb, followed by primary closure.
Twelve consecutive fasciotomy wounds, referred from 2005 to 2012, were closed using this approach.
The average wound closure time was 3.4 days (range three to five days) following the initial consultation.
All 12 fasciotomy wounds responded with no revisions, complications, failures or loss of skin sensation.
The approach was successful in all anatomical locations that were closed and conversion to any techniques currently available in the literature was not necessary.
There are no costs associated with this approach, making it practical in settings with limited resources.
It has a high success rate, superior cosmetic results and, most importantly, it achieves an efficient closure time.
Therefore, this approach is superior to current techniques and should be a part of a plastic surgeon's armamentarium.

Abstract
The authors describe the case of a five-month-old girl who was taken to the emergency room because of burns on her abdomen.
The child was reported to have spilled two small bottles of beauty nail adhesive on her clothes while her mother was preparing dinner.
After undressing the infant, the mother discovered several lesions on the child's abdomen and quickly sought medical attention.
Given the unusual circumstances of the presentation, the child was hospitalized for both treatment and supervision.
The beauty nail adhesive contained cyanoacrylate.
In addition to its well-appreciated adhesive capacity, cyanoacrylate, in the presence of cotton or other tissues, is known to produce an exothermic reaction that may cause burns.
Cyanoacrylate-based products, due to their possible adverse effects, should be kept away from children as advised.
Odd injuries should always raise concerns about the possibility of inflicted injury.

Abstract
The present article summarizes the results from the Active Healthy Kids Canada 2012 Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth.
The Report Card assessed the physical activity levels of Canadian children and youth nationally, and the initiatives of public and nongovernment sectors to promote and facilitate physical activity opportunities for children and youth in Canada.
Based on a comprehensive collection of data that were analyzed and/or published in 2011, 24 indicators relating to physical activity were graded.
The Physical Activity Levels indicator, the core indicator of the Report Card, was graded an 'F' for the sixth consecutive year.
Although the majority of grades remained unchanged from the previous year, four grades improved and two worsened.


Abstract
Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is commonly prescribed for upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children.
Azithromycin should be avoided in patients with a significant risk of bacteremia.
It is associated with pneumococcal resistance and, with stated exceptions, is generally not recommended for the treatment of acute pharyngitis, acute otitis media or pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia in the paediatric population.

Abstract
Fungal osteomyelitis is rare in immunocompetent patients and is often difficult to cure, even with optimal medical and surgical management.
The authors present two cases of fungal osteomyelitis in which the common swimming pool cleaner, polyhexamethylene biguanide, was used successfully as an adjunct to standard surgical and medical treatment.
Also presented is a literature review on the use of polyhexamethylene biguanide for this indication.
The authors recommend that this safe and well-tolerated compound be considered as part of the treatment for fungal osteomyelitis.

Abstract
Using a standardized case report form, treating physicians reported children hospitalized due to MRSA infections in Canadian hospitals through the Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program in a 24-month period (2008 to 2010).
Of 155 cases reported, 70% were ≤4 years of age and approximately one-third had an underlying medical condition.
The most common clinical infections involved skin and soft tissue (69%), the lower respiratory tract (12%), and bone and joint (10%).
Almost one-third had had contact with the health care environment in the previous year and 18% had a known household member with MRSA.
Initial therapy with a beta-lactam alone occurred in 65%, while 22% included vancomycin.
No child in this cohort died but 14% required admission to the intensive care unit.
Of 143 reports of individual isolates, 93% were reported susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 63% to clindamycin and 50% to mupirocin.
The present study involved only children hospitalized with MRSA infections.
It may not be representative of the children treated as outpatients nor children in selected areas of Canada where MRSA infections may be more endemic.
Further targeted surveillance to identify risks and treatment practices in these populations may be important.


Abstract
The current standard of care in Canadian obstetrical practice is to offer pregnant women the opportunity for prenatal investigation to diagnose congenital abnormalities.
Prenatal amniocentesis is Canada's most commonly practiced invasive procedure for the diagnosis of chromosomal and single gene disorders.
The potential risk of intrapartum HIV transmission during amniocentesis raises several ethical concerns and limits the availability of prenatal genetic testing for HIV-positive pregnant women.
Complete virological suppression with antiretroviral therapy may alleviate the risk of mother-to-child transmission during amniocentesis and increase accessibility of this important diagnostic tool in the HIV-positive population.


Abstract
The nonspecific clinical presentation and possible post-therapeutic complications lead to problems for the diagnosis of this infection and the support of the patient.

Abstract
Childhood maltreatment represents a significant risk factor for the development of a number of mental and physical health outcomes.
Converging evidence suggests that early adversity induces significant and persistent biological changes in individuals ('biological embedding').
The present review focuses on the impact of childhood maltreatment on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune system function in both children and adults.
Furthermore, childhood maltreatment is associated with disruptions in various immune system markers including pro- and anti-inflammatory substances, and markers of cell-mediated immunity.
The potential of interventions to reduce these negative biological effects in maltreated children is also discussed.

It concludes with specific guidance for the clinician.


Abstract
When collected systematically using common definitions, information regarding deaths in children and youth can help with understanding the scope of problems.
Information about the context of a death can inform potential prevention or intervention activities.
CDR can improve medical and mental health best practices, child welfare policies and procedures, and legislation and education relevant to public health and safety.
In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, CDR processes are mandated by legislation.
In Canada, death review teams have diverse structures and functions, and the CDR system is less well developed.
The present statement addresses the need for formal, organized child and youth death review in Canada to help strengthen and systemize injury and death prevention efforts.

Abstract
There appears to be increased use of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the preoperative planning of autologous perforator flap breast reconstruction.
Despite the advantages of providing superior anatomical detail, concerns regarding cost and radiation exposure of this technique remain.
In the current study, a paper-based survey was distributed to 44 plastic surgeons with a special interest in breast reconstruction at 19 different centres across Canada to collect their perspectives and practice characteristics with respect to the use of CTA as a preoperative imaging modality in breast reconstruction.
The response rate of the survey was 75%.
The majority of respondents commonly use perforator flap breast reconstruction and CTA in their breast reconstruction practice.
Surgeons identified particular benefits of CTA in patients who had previously undergone abdominal surgery.
However, more than one-half of the overall cohort was concerned about radiation exposure associated with CTA.
A review of the literature suggests that it may be worthwhile to reduce the unnecessary risks of additional radiation exposure to the breast cancer population.
A prospective study may help to better define the group of patients in whom CTA will provide optimal benefits in terms of reducing perioperative microvascular morbidity.


Abstract
Women with hypertrophic breasts often experience body pain and posture problems, which tend to be reduced or even eliminated after reduction mammoplasty.
The present study aimed to analyze the effects of reduction mammoplasty on anthropometric variables, body posture and pain in women with breast hypertrophy.
Eleven women (mean [± SD] age 31.3±10.4 years) participated in the present study.
Anthropometric variables, body posture and pain perception were evaluated pretest, and 60 (post60) and 90 (post90) days after reduction mammoplasty.
There were no significant differences in anthropometric variables among the assessments.
There were significant reductions in pain at post60 and post90 in the neck, cervical spine, back, shoulder and arm (P<0.05).
Following mammoplasty, an improvement in body posture, primarily in the alignment of shoulders, trunk and pelvis, and a decrease in pain in the upper limbs and spine, were observed.

The reversed palmaris longus muscle represents a structure that is tendinous proximally and muscular distally (opposite of the normal palmaris longus).


Abstract
Creation of an aesthetically pleasing nipple plays a significant role in breast reconstruction as a determining factor in patient satisfaction.
The goals for nipple reconstruction include minimal donor site morbidity and appropriate, long-lasting projection.
Currently, the most popular techniques used are associated with a significant loss of projection postoperatively.
Accordingly, the authors introduce the angel flap, which is designed to achieve nipple projection with lasting results.

Abstract
The evolution has focused on limiting morbidity of the donor site.
The transition from the transverse rectus abdominus muscle free flap to the muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominus muscle free flap to the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator free flap has markedly improved abdominal-based autologous breast reconstruction.
However, all of these flaps involve an incision through the anterior rectus fascia and potential damage of intercostal motor and sensory nerves.
The superficial inferior epigastric artery flap (SIEA) reliably perfuses the ipsilateral hemiabdomen, yet does not violate the fascia or any motor nerves.
As a result, the incidence of hernia, abdominal wall weakness and bulging is essentially eliminated.
Nevertheless, use of the SIEA flap remains marginal.
Vessel size, dissection difficulties and lack of understanding of the relevant anatomy have limited its acceptance.
The present article describes a rapid, reliable and safe dissection technique with an algorithm for harvesting the SIEA flap in autologous breast reconstruction.


Abstract
Schizophrenia is characterized by significant heterogeneity in outcome.
The last decades have witnessed a significant interest in identifying factors that can moderate or influence clinical and functional outcomes in people with schizophrenia.
One factor of particular interest is neurocognition, as performance on various measures of cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and executive functions, have been consistently related to functional outcome and, to a lesser extent, clinical outcome.
This review aims to provide an up-to-date description of recent studies examining the association between neurocognition and clinical and (or) functional outcomes.
In the first section, studies examining neurocognitive performance in relation to clinical outcome are examined.
When clinical outcome is defined dichotomously (for example, comparing remitted and nonremitted), verbal memory performance consistently exhibits a strong association with clinical status, with the poor outcome group showing the largest deficits.
In the second section, studies exploring the relation between neurocognition and various dimensions of functional outcome are reviewed.
These dimensions include independent living, social functioning, and vocational functioning, among others.
Again, a strong link between neurocognitive deficits and impairments in several aspects of functioning clearly emerges from this review.
Addressing these measurement issues will be key to studies examining the development of effective interventions targeting neurocognitive functions and their impact on clinical and functional outcomes.


Abstract
This paper aims to review longitudinal studies assessing the impact of cognition on function in patients with schizophrenia.
PubMed and Scholars Portal were searched using search terms related to schizophrenia, cognition, function, and longitudinal studies.
Some functional abilities have been studied more than others.
Some studies suggest that the impact of cognition on function depends on the severity of baseline cognitive deficits.
Other studies suggest that the impact of cognition on function depend on what phase of the illness the patient is in or what stage in that particular function the patient is involved in.
Finally, few studies assessed interactions between cognition and other aspects of schizophrenia in predicting function, such as functional capacity, insight, motivation, and negative symptoms.
More longitudinal and comprehensive studies are needed.
A focus on community living is of high public significance as patients with schizophrenia continue to grow old.
Future studies should also focus on the longitudinal interactions between cognition and other dimensions of schizophrenia as well as on the biological factors that underlie these interactions.


Abstract
These principles have been studied since the inception of behavioral science, and more recently neuroscience has helped understand brain systems and mechanisms responsible for enabling aspects of memory.
Here we outline the history of work on memory and its neural underpinning, and describe the major dimensions of memory processing that have been evaluated by cognitive neuroscience, focusing on episodic memory.
We then describe deficits associated with schizophrenia.
Impairment in schizophrenia is more severe in patients with negative symptoms-especially flat affect-who also show deficits in measures of social cognition.
This evidence implicates medial temporal and frontal regions in schizophrenia.


Abstract
This review examines the evidence for a neurobiological explanation of executive functions of working memory.


Abstract
Deficits in brain networks that support cognitive regulatory functions are prevalent in many psychiatric disorders.
Findings across neuropsychology and neuroimaging point to broad-based impairments that cross traditional diagnostic boundaries.
These dysfunctions are largely separate from the classical symptoms of the disorders, and manifest in regulatory problems in both traditional cognitive and emotional domains.
Advances in cognitive neuroscience now allow us to ground an understanding of these cognitive regulatory deficits in the function and interaction of key brain networks.


Abstract
Each of these types of drug-induced modifications can be viewed as a form of "cellular or molecular memory."
The goal of these studies which aim to explicate the molecular and cellular basis of drug addiction is to eventually develop biologically based diagnostic tests, as well as more effective treatments for addiction disorders.


Abstract
Loss of memory is among the first symptoms reported by patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and by their caretakers.
Working memory and long-term declarative memory are affected early during the course of the disease.
The individual pattern of impaired memory functions correlates with parameters of structural or functional brain integrity.
AD pathology interferes with the formation of memories from the molecular level to the framework of neural networks.
The investigation of AD memory loss helps to identify the involved neural structures, such as the default mode network, the influence of epigenetic and genetic factors, such as ApoE4 status, and evolutionary aspects of human cognition.
Clinically, the analysis of memory assists the definition of AD subtypes, disease grading, and prognostic predictions.
Despite new AD criteria that allow the earlier diagnosis of the disease by inclusion of biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid or hippocampal volume analysis, neuropsychological testing remains at the core of AD diagnosis.


Abstract
Plasticity is found throughout the nervous system and is thought to underlie key aspects of development, learning and memory, and repair.
Neuropiastic processes include synaptic plasticity, cellular growth and remodeling, and neurogenesis.
Dysregulation of these processes can contribute to a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases.
In this review we explore three different ways in which dysregulation of neuropiastic and mnemonic processes can contribute to psychiatric illness.
First, impairment of the mechanisms of plasticity can lead to cognitive deficits; this is most obvious in dementia and amnesia, but is also seen in more subtle forms in other conditions.
We explore the relationship between stress, major depression, and impaired neuroplasticity in some detail.
Second, enhanced memories can be pathogenic; we explore the example of post-traumatic stress disorder, in which intrusive trauma associated memories, accompanied by hyperactivity of the normal fear learning circuitry, are core aspects of the pathology.
Together, these examples illustrate how different abnormalities in the mechanisms of neuroplasticity and memory formation can contribute to various forms of psychopathology.
It is hoped that a growing understanding of these relationships, and of the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity in the normal brain, will pave the way for new understandings of the mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disease and the development of novel treatment strategies.


Abstract
AM retrieval encompasses a large neural network including the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, and limbic structures.
All these regions subserve the cognitive processes (episodic remembering, cognitive control, self-processing, and scene construction) at play during memory retrieval.
We emphasize the specific role of medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus in self-processing during autobiographical memory retrieval.
Overall, these data call for further studies in psychiatric patients, to investigate the neural underpinnings of autobiographical memory and self-representation in mental disorders.

Abstract
Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) can be used to identify bacteria directly from positive blood and sterile fluid cultures.
Correct identification to the genus and species levels was obtained in 75 of 80 (93.8%) and 39 of 50 (78%) blood culture broths, respectively.
MALDI-TOF MS is a promising tool for the direct identification of organisms cultured from sterile sites.


Abstract
HIV-1 tropism assays play a crucial role in determining the response to CCR5 receptor antagonists.
Initially, phenotypic tests were used, but limited access to these tests prompted the development of alternative strategies.
Recently, genotyping tropism has been validated using a Canadian technology in clinical trials investigating the use of maraviroc in both experienced and treatment-naive patients.
The present guidelines review the evidence supporting the use of genotypic assays and provide recommendations regarding tropism testing in daily clinical management.


Abstract
In North America, experience with artesunate is limited.
With the pressure to discharge patients early, administration of the essential oral partner drug is often left to the discretion of the patient.
Thus, treatment failure may be commonplace if nonadherence is a factor, as was observed in the case described in the present report.


Abstract
Recent experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the negative effects of nicotine on the viability of skin flaps.
Necrotic damage to skin flaps can result in significant complications including delayed wound healing, dehiscence and wound contraction.
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil citrate, have a protective effect in ischemic injuries of the brain, kidney, myocardium, spinal cord, ileum and testes.
In the present study, the authors evaluated the effect of sildenafil citrate on the viability of skin exposed to nicotine-induced ischemia in Sprague Dawley rats.
In the preoperative period, the rats were divided into three groups of 10 rats each.
Group C was treated with subcutaneous saline and group S and group N were treated with 2 mg/kg nicotine, administered subcutaneously twice per day for 28 days.
McFarlane flaps were created in all experimental animals using an incision measuring 7 cm × 3 cm.
Postoperative treatment varied among the groups: group S was treated with 20 mg/kg/day sildenafil citrate, while group C and group N were treated with equivalent doses of saline for seven days.
A laser Doppler flow meter was used to monitor the microvasculature.
Preoperative measurements of the microvasculature revealed decreased blood flow in group N and group S, both of which were treated with subcutaneous nicotine.
During the postoperative evaluation, a trend toward increased blood flow was observed in group S compared with the group with nicotine-induced ischemia treated with saline alone postoperatively (group N).
A visual fluorescein dye test was used to predict skin viability and demonstrated diminished skin viability in group N and group S (P<0.05) during the preoperative period.
Following treatment with sildenafil for seven days, a statically significant improvement in skin viability was observed in group S (P<0.05).
Nicotine decreased blood flow within the skin and impaired skin viability, while postoperative application of sildenafil significantly ameliorated the ischemic effects of nicotine and improved skin viability.
Future studies will be required to evaluate the clinical use of sildenafil for the improvement of blood flow in ischemic injury of the skin.


Abstract
The management of incidental findings of reduction mammoplasty specimens.
Occasionally, there are findings reported by pathologists that are unfamiliar to the treating surgeon.
The aim of the present study was to determine the types of pathologies encountered in reduction mammoplasty specimens.
From this list of diagnoses, a best practice guideline for management will be organized to better assist plastic surgeons in the management of patients with incidental findings on pathology reports.
A total of 441 pathology reports from patients who underwent bilateral or unilateral reduction mammoplasty in the past three years were identified.
A list of 21 different pathologies was generated from the pathology reports, along with supplemental data from recent texts and articles.
Occult carcinomas were encountered in two cases (0.45%) and high-risk lesions were found in three cases (0.68%) at the authors' institution.
An algorithm was then constructed to organize the pathologies according to risk of malignancy and assign them to a management guideline.
There are many different lesions encountered incidentally in reduction mammoplasty specimens that may or may not confer some cancer risk.
It is important for plastic surgeons to know which lesions need closer follow-up to provide the best care for their patients.

Abstract
A case involving a retired, elderly male war veteran with a symptomatic peroneus brevis muscle hernia causing superficial peroneal nerve compression with chosen surgical management is presented.
Symptomatic muscle hernias of the extremities occur most commonly in the leg and are a rare cause of chronic leg pain.
Historically, treating military surgeons pioneered the early documentation of leg hernias observed in active military recruits.
A focal fascial defect can cause a muscle to herniate, forming a variable palpable subcutaneous mass, and causing pain and potentially neuropathic symptoms with nerve involvement.
While the true incidence is not known, the etiology has been classified as secondary to a congenital (or constitutional) fascial weakness, or acquired fascial defect, usually secondary to direct or indirect trauma.
The highest occurrence is believed to be in young, physically active males.
Involvement of the tibialis anterior is most common, although other muscles have been reported.
Dynamic ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging is often used to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment.
Most symptomatic cases respond successfully to conservative treatment, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.
A variety of surgical techniques have been described, ranging from fasciotomy to anatomical repair of the fascial defect, with no consensus on optimal treatment.
Clinicians must remember to consider muscle hernias in their repertoire of differential diagnoses for chronic leg pain or neuropathy.
A comprehensive review of muscle hernias of the leg is presented to highlight their history, occurrence, presentation, diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract
The burden of chronic disease is placing pressure on the Canadian health care system.
These patients present a challenge to community providers who are expected to provide holistic care and manage complex issues, often with a paucity of services and supports.
Alternative models of care may address the complex needs of this population.
In addition, strategies can be implemented in community practices that may assist with the care of children with medical complexity such as collaborative care, engagement of key workers, focus on goal-directed care and use of care plans.


Abstract
The effect of active video games (AVGs) on acute energy expenditure has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.
The present article outlines the process and outcomes of the development of the AHKC's position on active video games for children and youth.
In light of the available evidence, AHKC does not recommend AVGs as a strategy to help children be more physically active.

Abstract
The renal parenchymal cone (RPC) is an important differential diagnosis to the real kidney tumors.
The aim of this prospective study was to determine the frequency of CB-RPC and the L-RPC.
At least one RPC was found in 53 patients.
27 RPC were on both sides.
CB-RPC was present in 27,5% of the kidneys, a L-RPC in 12,5%.
The high frequency of RPC underlines its importance in the diagnosis of focal renal parenchymal changes.

Abstract
In this review, we examine the evidence supporting the tubal origin hypothesis for HGSC, and discuss the clinical implications of our improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer.
Articles and findings were summarized descriptively.
A step-wise transformation from normal epithelium to a lesion with the ability to invade and metastasize has been demonstrated within the fallopian tube.
Intraepithelial or early invasive carcinoma of the fallopian tube is frequently identified in BRCA mutation carriers who undergo prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.
In both BRCA mutation carriers and women from the general population, pre-invasive changes within the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube appear in association with early HGSC.
Molecular and genetic studies, as well as in vitro and animal models, have also supported a tubal origin for HGSC.
Whether the removal of fallopian tubes (salpingectomy) at the time of pelvic surgery for other reasons will lead to reductions in mortality from ovarian cancer is currently unknown, but it is an important area for future clinical research.

We discuss here the rationale and the evidence for the use of customized growth percentiles for the purpose of distinguishing between the fetus with true IUGR and the fetus with constitutional SGA.


Abstract
Through the years, the burn injury has been described using a variety of labels.
These labels have ranged from one word terms to phrases including degrees of injury or more descriptive terms.
A search was conducted relying on a common general internet search engine.
After multiple searches varying the keywords, the top 100 searches identified the most prevalent terms or phrases, ranging from the common to the more obscure.
The search was repeated using the most prevalent terms or phrases identified in the common internet search engine, focusing on either the title or abstract for all papers indexed in PubMed.
This process narrowed the attention to the most common terms or phrases used by the academics in their published work.
This work therefore focused on measuring the specific terms being used today and their frequency of use in the peer reviewed papers indexed in the PubMed system.
It is difficult to focus on the unique aspects of any given profession when there is confusion surrounding a common vocabulary.
By identifying and noting in the academic literature the most commonly used labels, a point of reference can be created for future work.
Furthermore, having a common and accurate set of labels that are uniformly applied across the profession is critical for academia to include in training and education programs for physicians, nurses, and paramedical staff.


Abstract
A common factor among these latter 5 patients was that they were injured by overhead high electrical voltage cables.
Their management was labour intensive and highly costly.
In this report, the type of accident, the electrical voltage that produced burns and the treatment details are elaborated.
Findings included similarities in age and type of accident, and failure to implement safety procedures and apply standard norms of high voltage transmission feeder lines.


Abstract
Pneumonia is common among critically ill burn patients and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among them.
Prediction of mortality in patients with severe burns remains unreliable.
The aim of this research is to study the incidence, early diagnosis and management of nosocomial pneumonia, and to discuss the relationship between pneumonia and death in burn patients.
This prospective study was carried out on 80 burn patients (35 males and 45 females) admitted to Menoufiya University Hospital Burn Center and Chest Department, Egypt, from September 2011 to March 2012.
Our findings showed an overall burn patient mortality rate of 26.25 % (21/80), 15% (12/80) incidence of pneumonia, and a 50% (6/12) mortality rate among patients with pneumonia compared to 22 % (15/68) for those without pneumonia.
The incidence of pneumonia was twice as high in the subset of patients with inhalation injury as among those without inhalation injury (P< 0.001).
It was found that the presence of pneumonia, inhalation injury, increased burn size, and advanced age were all associated with increased mortality (P< 0.001).
In the late onset pneumonia, other associated factors also contributed to mortality.
Severity of disease, severity of illness (APACHE score), organ failure, underlying co-morbidities, and VAP PIRO score all have significant correlations with mortality rate.
Pneumonia was an important factor for predicting burn patient mortality.
Early detection and management of pneumonia are absolutely essential.


Abstract
Split skin grafting is a widely used technique for reconstructing skin defects.
Although a vast number of different coverage options for donor sites have become available in daily clinical practice, no optimum dressing material has been found to date.
A total of 69 respondents from 34 countries took part in the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 13.8% (69/500) over a 1-month period.
With regard to the design of the dressing material, the majority of participants preferred a one-piece (composite) dressing product (44/69, 63.8%).
The majority of respondents also denied the current availability of an "ideal" donor site dressing (49/69, 71%).
The strength of this study was the remarkable geographic distribution of responses; all parts of the world were included and participated.


Abstract
Autografting is limited, however, by availability in very extensive burns, despite the use of expanded (meshed) skin.
Alternatives have therefore been required, and deceased donor allograft is considered the gold standard.
Fresh allograft use is limited by supply, and legislative and cultural restrictions have significantly influenced availability, despite evidence of its efficacy.
This necessitates the establishment of a deceased donor skin bank in South Africa, with a mandate to procure and store allograft for distribution to burns units when required.


Abstract
Burn wound infections remain the most important factor limiting survival in burn intensive care units.
Faced with challenging fluid resuscitation, wound excision and cardiopulmonary stabilization, mycosis in burns are likely to be underestimated.
Diagnostic performance can sometimes be delayed because clinical signs are unspecific and differentiation between colonization and infection is difficult.
This review aims to highlight the main important aspects of fungal infections in burns including incidence, infection control, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, prognosis and outcomes.


Abstract
Various types of wound care products abound for the treatment of burn injuries.
Most of these products are rather expensive and beyond the means of many patients in poorer countries.
The aim of this study is to review the outcome of our burn patients managed with topical silver sulphadiazine dressing in terms of time to wound healing and length of hospital stay.
Consecutive burn patients admitted over a four year period were included in the study.
The patients were resuscitated along standard protocols and their wounds were dressed daily with dermazin.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were retrieved and analyzed using the SPSS version 16.
The primary outcome measure for the study was the time to complete re-epithelialization of the wounds and discharge of the patients.
144 patients with a M: F ratio of 2.3: 1 were managed during the period.
The age range was 4 months to 81.9 years with a median age of 26 years.
The TBSA range was 1 to 99% with a median of 28.5%.
The mean duration from time of injury to wound healing was 21.5 days with a median of 17 days.
Open burn wound dressing with silver sulphadiazine offers a satisfactory outcome and should be considered for burn dressing in low resource settings.


Abstract
Necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is a rare but potentially fatal infection.
It usually complicates skin traumas, such as lacerations, scratches, insect bites, burns and recent surgeries.
Rapid diagnosis is crucial for a favourable prognosis.
NSTI is an emergency surgical condition and every delay in the operative treatment has a proven negative effect.
Recently, a rare case presented to us with a late diagnosis of NSTI complicating a scald burn of the lower limb.
The patient's injury was initially treated as a burn case but unfortunately ended in an above knee amputation.
We report our management experience in this case, with a review of the literature.

Abstract
Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is defined as attacks of blanking, subsequent cyanosis and rubeosis of fingers due to vasospasms in response to cold or emotional stimuli.
Primary RP has no known underlying cause and occurs mainly in young and otherwise healthy women.
Related affections are acrocyanosis and finger artery occlusions either due to arteriosclerosis or vasculitis.
Also spontaneous finger hematoma may provoke an episode of RP.
Therapeutically strict cold protection and avoidance of possible noxa is recommended besides the treatment of underlying diseases.
No standard vasoactive drug has proven ideal for RP due to side effects.
In cases with rest pain or ulcerations the same principles are applied as in ischemic diseases with no possibility for revascularization.

Abstract
It can be challenging to detect syringomyelia in patients with scoliosis, as some cases are mildly symptomatic with little to no neurological deficits.
However, a timely diagnosis of syringomyelia is needed to facilitate important treatment considerations.
This case report details an 11-year-old female with mild scoliosis and a two-year history of spinal pain that had short-term symptomatic relief from chiropractic treatment.
Subtle neurological signs were detected only at re-evaluation, which prompted further investigation with radiographs and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MRI revealed a non-expansile syrinx measuring 3 mm at its widest diameter that extended from C5 to the conus medullaris.
The aim of this case is to heighten awareness of the potential diagnostic challenges in patients with syringomyelia and scoliosis.
The incidence, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of syringomyelia will be presented to help primary contact providers with appropriate referral and co-management of these patients.


Abstract
The lumbar part of the diaphragm arises from the lumbar vertebrae by right and left crura.
The duplication of crura of the diaphragm is rarely reported in the past.
The right crus of the diaphragm was duplicated completely and presented two separate crura; medial right crus & lateral right crus.
The lateral right crus attached only to the intervertebral disc between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.
These two crura bordered a retrocrural space in the inferior posterior mediastinum.
The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves entered the abdomen by passing through this space.
No duplication was observed in the left crus.
The muscle fibres of medial right crus contributed to the formation of the esophageal opening.
Knowledge of variations in the diaphragmatic crural anatomy is useful in the diagnosis of disease processes in the retrocrural space and also might help while performing the surgical repair of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Abstract
Atlantoaxial subluxation that is not related to traumatic, congenital, or rheumatological conditions is rare and can be a diagnostic challenge.
This case report details a case of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation in an 83-year-old female without history of trauma, congenital, or rheumatological conditions.
She presented to the chiropractor with insidious neck pain and headaches, without neurological deficits.
Radiographs revealed a widened atlantodental space (measuring 6 mm) indicating anterior atlantoaxial subluxation and potential sagittal atlantoaxial instability.
Prompt detection and appropriate conservative management resulted in favourable long-term outcome at 13-months follow-up.
Conservative management included education, mobilizations, soft tissue therapy, monitoring for neurological progression, and co-management with the family physician.
The purpose of this case report is to heighten awareness of the clinical presentation of idiopathic anterior atlantoaxial subluxation without neurological deficits.
Discussion will focus on the incidence, mechanism, clinical presentation, and conservative management of a complex case of anterior atlantoaxial subluxation.

Abstract
Canadian and international guidelines address the ethical conduct of health research in general and the issues affecting Indigenous populations in particular.
This statement summarizes, for clinicians and researchers, relevant ethical and practical considerations for health research involving Aboriginal children and youth.
Further research on current health issues and inequities should lead to practical, effective and culturally relevant applications.
Expanding our knowledge of ways to address the health disparities facing Canada's Aboriginal children and youth can inform health policy and the provision of services.
Community-based participatory research is proposed as a means to achieve this goal.

Cancer in Canada fact sheet series #1 - thyroid cancer in Canada.
The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing more rapidly than that of any other cancer in Canada, while mortality has remained low and stable.
In the last 10 years the number of thyroid cancer cases has increased 144% from 1709 to 4172 cases per year.
Thyroid cancer is three times more common in females than males.
40% of thyroid cancers are diagnosed in Canadians under 45 years of age.


Abstract
Philip Morris has recently brought claims against Australia (2011) and Uruguay (2010) under international investment agreements (IIAs).
The claims allege that Philip Morris is entitled to compensation following the introduction of innovative tobacco packaging regulations to reduce smoking and prevent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).
Since tobacco control measures are often viewed as a model for public health nutrition measures, the claims raise the question of how investment law governs the latter.
This paper begins to answer this question and to explain how governments can proactively protect policy space for public health nutrition in an era of expanding IIAs.
The authors first consider the main interventions proposed to reduce diet-related NCDs and their intersection with investment in the food supply chain.
They then review the nature of investment regimes and relevant case law and examine ways to maximize policy space for public health nutrition intervention within this legal context.
As foreign investment increases across the food-chain and more global recommendations discouraging the consumption of unhealthful products are issued, investment law will increase in importance as part of the legal architecture governing the food supply.
The implications of investment law for public health nutrition measures depend on various factors: the measures themselves, the terms of the applicable agreements, the conditions surrounding the foreign investment and the policies governing agricultural support.
This analysis suggests that governments should adopt proactive measures--e.g. the clarification of terms and reliance on exceptions--to manage investment and protect their regulatory autonomy with respect to public health nutrition.


Abstract
Peripheral tissue injury is one of the well-described morbidities associated with stays in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Abstract
The well-planned, comprehensive discharge of a medically stable infant helps to ensure a positive transition to home and safe, effective care after discharge.
This statement provides guidance in planning discharge of infants born before 34 weeks' gestational age from tertiary and community settings.
Discharge readiness is usually determined by demonstration of functional maturation, including the physiological competencies of thermoregulation, control of breathing, respiratory stability, and feeding skills and weight gain.
Supporting family involvement and providing education from the time of admission improve parental confidence and decrease anxiety.
Assessing the physical and psychosocial discharge environment is an important part of the discharge process.
The clinical team is responsible for ensuring that appropriate investigations and screening tests have been completed, that medical concerns have been resolved and that a follow-up plan is in place at the time of discharge home.


Abstract
In the present study, the authors conducted a brief environmental scan to investigate the ethics teaching strategies in Canadian NPM programs.
Ten of 13 (77%) accredited Canadian NPM residency programs participated in a survey investigating teaching strategies, content and assessment mechanisms.
This variability indicates the need for agreement and standardization among program directors regarding these aspects, and warrants further investigation.

Abstract
This education, however, often occurs under difficult or time-pressured learning conditions.
The authors present principles derived from three basic theories of human cognition that may help to guide clinicians' instruction of parents and patients.
Dual code theory suggests that humans have separate cognitive 'channels' for text/audio information versus visual information.
By constructing educational messages that take advantage of both channels simultaneously, information uptake may be improved.
Multimedia theory is based on the notion that there is an optimal blend of media to accomplish a given learning objective.
The authors suggest seven practical strategies that clinicians may use to improve patient education.

Abstract
Rectal adenomas and cancers occur frequently.
Small adenomas can be removed colonoscopically, whereas larger polyps are removed via conventional transanal excision.
Owing to technical difficulties, adenomas of the mid- and upper rectum require radical resection.
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) was first designed as an alternative treatment for these lesions.
However, since its development TEM has been also used for a variety of rectal lesions, including carcinoids, rectal prolapse and diverticula, early stage carcinomas and palliative resection of rectal cancers.
The objective of this review is to describe the current status of TEM in the treatment of rectal lesions.
Since the 1980s, TEM has advanced substantially.
With low recurrence rates, it is the method of choice for resection of endoscopically unresectable adenomas.
Some studies have shown benefits to its use in treating early T1 rectal cancers compared with radical surgery in select patients.
However, for more advanced rectal cancers TEM should be considered palliative or experimental.
This technique has also been shown to be safe for the treatment of other uncommon rectal tumours, such as carcinoids.
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery may allow for new strategies in the treatment of rectal pathology where technical limitations of transanal techniques have limited endoluminal surgical innovations.


Abstract
As a method of producing effective and sustainable weight loss, bariatric surgery plays a major role in the treatment of obesity.
We reviewed the literature on the effects of different types of bariatric surgery on the symptomatic relief of GERD and its complications.
Roux-en- Y gastric bypass was considered an effective method to alleviate symptoms of GERD, whereas laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy appeared to increase the incidence of the disease.
Adjustable gastric banding was seen to initially improve the symptoms of GERD; however, a subset of patients experienced a new onset of GERD symptoms during long-term follow-up.

Abstract
Treatment options for prostate cancer are currently widely discussed in the media and by urologic associations.
For this large group of patients focal therapy offers additional valuable treatment option.
Malignant prostate tissue can be specifically ablated by High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU).
Thus, the cancer can be controlled without removing the whole prostate and with minimal side effects.
Multimodal magnetic resonance tomography, specific biopsies and monitoring contribute to the safety of this new treatment strategy.

Abstract
Colostrum-replacement products are an alternative to provide passive immunity to neonatal calves; however, their ability to provide adequate levels of antibodies recognizing respiratory viruses has not been described.
The objective of this study was to compare the serum levels of IgG at 2 d of age and the duration of detection of antibodies to bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) in calves fed maternal colostrum (MC) or a colostrum replacement (CR) at birth.
Forty newborn male Holstein calves were assigned to the CR or the MC group.
Group CR (n = 20) received 2 packets of colostrum replacement (100 g of IgG per 470-g packet), while group MC (n = 20) received 3.8 L of maternal colostrum.
Blood samples for detection of IgG and virus antibodies were collected from each calf at birth, at 2 and 7 d, and monthly until the calves became seronegative.
Calves in the MC group had greater IgG concentrations at 2 d of age.
The apparent efficiency of absorption of IgG was greater in the MC group than in the CR group, although the difference was not significant.
Calves in the CR group had greater concentrations of BVDV neutralizing antibodies during the first 4 mo of life.
The levels of antibodies to BRSV, BHV-1, and BPIV-3 were similar in the 2 groups.
The mean time to seronegativity was similar for each virus in the 2 groups; however, greater variation was observed in the antibody levels and in the duration of detection of immunity in the MC group than in the CR group.
Thus, the CR product provided calves with more uniform levels and duration of antibodies to common bovine respiratory viruses.


Abstract
The primary objective of this study was to investigate whether rider experience influences the assessment and grading of lameness in horses based on under-saddle gait analysis.
Thirteen adult sports horses in active training were included in the study.
After a baseline lameness and neurologic examination by the principal investigators, horses were videotaped while being ridden by an experienced and a less experienced rider.
A 3-minute video was made for each horse and rider and 26 videos were randomly ordered and compiled on a DVD.
Veterinarians with different levels of experience in evaluating lameness and veterinary students viewed the DVD and assigned a lameness score to each horse/rider combination.
In a model accounting for the expertise of the evaluator, there was no difference in overall lameness scores between experienced and less experienced riders.
This result was consistent for both sound and unsound horses.
The overall lameness scores reported by specialists and students, however, differed significantly.
The lameness score reported by the study participants while the horse was ridden was significantly associated with the subjective baseline lameness assessment reported by the principal investigators for the same limb when the horse was not under saddle.


Abstract
The purpose of the study was to investigate whether acute strenuous exercise (1600- to 2500-m race) would elicit an acute phase response (APR) in Standardbred trotters.
Blood levels of several inflammatory markers [serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin, fibrinogen, white blood cell count (WBC), and iron], muscle enzymes [creatinine kinase (CK) and aspartate transaminase (AST)], and hemoglobin were assessed in 58 Standardbred trotters before and after racing.
Concentrations of CK, AST, SAA, and fibrinogen were unaltered in response to racing.
Acute strenuous exercise did not elicit an acute phase reaction.
The pathogenesis and clinical implications of the hematological and blood-biochemical changes elicited by acute exercise in Standardbred trotters in the present study warrant further investigation.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to compare recovery from desflurane anesthesia in horses with or without post-anesthetic xylazine.
Six adult horses were anesthetized on 2 occasions, 14 d apart using a prospective, randomized crossover design.
Horses were sedated with xylazine, induced to lateral recumbency with ketamine and diazepam, and anesthesia was maintained with desflurane.
One of 2 treatments was administered intravenously at the end of anesthesia: xylazine [0.2 mg/kg body weight (BW)] or an equivalent volume of saline.
Recovery parameters were recorded and assessed by 2 blinded observers.
A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze recovery data.
Heart rate, arterial blood pressures, and arterial blood gas data were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures.
Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
Duration of anesthesia was not different between groups.
Administration of xylazine at the end of desflurane anesthesia was associated with significantly longer times to first movement, endotracheal tube removal, first attempt to achieve sternal recumbency, sternal recumbency, first attempt to stand, and standing.
Number of attempts to stand and quality of recovery scores were not different between groups.
Administering xylazine after desflurane anesthesia resulted in longer recovery times.
Recovery scores were not significantly different between groups.


Abstract
The purpose of this research was to study changes in the salivary proteome of healthy pigs in stressful situations to identify any potential new salivary biomarker of stress.
Three groups of animals were subjected to 3 stress models: snaring restraint followed by simulated sampling of vena cava blood; brief transport by road; and restriction of movement in a digestibility cage.
Saliva was obtained from each animal before and 15 and 30 min after the induction of stress.
The samples from the animals that showed the greatest increase in salivary cortisol concentration were pooled and run on 2-dimensional gels.
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was used for spot detection and mass spectrometry for spot identification.
Statistical analyses showed that 2 proteins had significant differences in expression before and after the induction of stress.
These proteins were identified as odorant-binding protein and fragments of albumin.
Further studies will be necessary to confirm the value of using these proteins as salivary biomarkers of stress in pigs.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of microbubble-based contrast for rapid ultrasonographic diagnosis of thrombosis in small animals, using male New Zealand white rabbits (average weight about 3.5 kg) as a model.
It was hypothesized that the use of microbubble-based contrast agents will result in a faster and more precise diagnosis in our model of thrombosis.


Abstract
Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are retroviruses found within domestic and wild cat populations.
These viruses cause severe illnesses that eventually lead to death.
Housing cats communally for long periods of time makes shelters at high risk for virus transmission among cats.
We tested 548 cats from 5 different sites across the island of Newfoundland for FIV and FeLV.
The overall seroprevalence was 2.2% and 6.2% for FIV and FeLV, respectively.
Two sites had significantly higher seroprevalence of FeLV infection than the other 3 sites.


Abstract
A bursting strength model, consisting of inserting and inflating a 200-L polyurethane bladder through a 25-cm VM celiotomy, was used on 15 fresh equine cadavers.
The horses' signalment, body weight, number of total knots, MF, and BS were recorded and analyzed statistically for interactions.


Abstract
Africa has the highest disease burden in the world and continues to depend on pharmaceutical imports to meet public health needs.
The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health gives member states of the World Trade Organization (WTO) the right to adopt legislation permitting the use of patented material without authorization by the patent holder, a provision known as "compulsory licensing".
For African countries to take full advantage of compulsory licensing they must develop substantial local manufacturing capacity.
Most countries in Africa are in the United Nations list of least developed countries, and this allows them, under WTO law, to refuse to grant patents for pharmaceuticals until 2021.
Thus, there is a compelling need for African countries to collaborate to build strong pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity in the continent now, while the current flexibilities in international intellectual property law offer considerable benefits.


Abstract
Leaders in attendance issued the declaration of Port of Spain, a call for the prevention and control of four major NCDs and their risk factors.
The instrument - a one-page colour-coded grid with 26 progress indicators - is updated annually by focal points in Caribbean health ministries, verified by each country's chief medical officer and presented to the annual Caucus of Caribbean Community Ministers of Health.
In this study, the G8 Research Group's methods for assessing compliance were applied to the 2009 reporting grid to assess each country's performance.
Given the success of the CARICOM Summit, a United Nations high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs was held in September 2011.
In May 2013 the World Health Assembly adopted nine global targets and 25 indicators to measure progress in NCD control.
This study shows that the CARICOM monitoring grid can be used to document progress on such indicators quickly and comprehensibly.
An annual reporting mechanism is essential to encourage steady progress and highlight areas needing correction.
This paper underscores the importance of accountability mechanisms for encouraging and monitoring compliance with the collective political commitments acquired at the highest level.


Abstract
Timor-Leste is in the process of addressing a key issue for the country's health sector: a medical workforce that is too small to provide adequate care.
In theory, a bilateral programme of medical cooperation with Cuba created in 2003 could solve this problem.
By the end of 2013, nearly 700 new doctors trained in Cuba had been added to Timor-Leste's medical workforce and by 2017 a further 328 doctors should have been trained in the country by Cuban and local health professionals.
It is expected that the number of physicians in Timor-Leste in 2017 will be more than three times the number present in the country in 2003.
Most of the new physicians are expected to work in rural communities and support the national government's goal of improving health outcomes for the rural majority.
It appears crucial that most of the new doctors be deployed in rural communities and managed carefully to optimize their rural retention.


Abstract
Existing and proposed metrics for household drinking-water services are intended to measure the availability, safety and accessibility of water sources.
However, these attributes can be highly variable over time and space and this variation complicates the task of creating and implementing simple and scalable metrics.
In this paper, we highlight those factors - especially those that relate to so-called improved water sources - that contribute to variability in water safety but may not be generally recognized as important by non-experts.
Problem s in the provision of water in adequate quantities and of adequate quality - interrelated problems that are often influenced by human behaviour - may contribute to an increased risk of poor health.
Such risk may be masked by global water metrics that indicate that we are on the way to meeting the world's drinking-water needs.
Given the complexity of the topic and current knowledge gaps, international metrics for access to drinking water should be interpreted with great caution.
We need further targeted research on the health impacts associated with improvements in drinking-water supplies.


Abstract
The acute knee injury represents one of the most common reasons to visit a general practitioner or an emergency department in a hospital.
The initial assessment of an acute knee injury usually is affected by severe swelling, pain and a significant lack of motion.
Conventional radiographs in three planes may provide additional information to limit the differential diagnosis.
A clinical re-evaluation after five to ten days usually allows proper functional testing and therefore correct diagnosis in the majority of cases can be made.
With suspicious clinical findings, MRI may be helpful to evaluate ligamentous, meniscal and cartilaginous structures.
Femoro-tibial knee dislocation represents the most harmful acute knee injury and needs to be further evaluated and treated in an adequate medical institution in every suspicious case.
Rapid vascular diagnostic with (CT)-angiography is crucial.
Behind a multi-ligament injury of the knee a spontaneously reduced dislocation may hide and proper neuro-vascular exam therefore is mandatory in every patient.
When fracture, blocking and major instability can be excluded at initial assessment, there is usually no need for any acute surgical intervention and initial conservative treatment may be conducted on an out-patient basis for most of the patients.
Priority of surgical treatment depends on the injury pattern and delayed intervention with a pre-habilitative phase may be beneficial for certain pathologies.


Abstract
Most common heart valve diseases in western industrialized nations are the aortic valve stenosis and the mitral valve regurgitation.
More seldom are a regurgitation of the aortic valve and mitral valve stenosis.
Even more seldom are heart valve diseases of the Tricuspid and the pulmonary valve.
The only curative therapy in severe heart valve disease is a surgical intervention.
The timing is crucial for the outcome.
Especially in asymptomatic patients it's difficult to find the right point of time for intervention due to missing realization of the health status.
In 2013, the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published guidelines according to the therapy in heart valve disease.
Here we want to summarize the recommendations of these guidelines in regards of timing of the surgical intervention.


Abstract
Treatment duration is often longer than in immunocompetent patients.
As preventive measures we provide vaccination against seasonal influenza and recommend specific daily hygiene measures.


Abstract
Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of mood disorders, basic and clinical research studies have begun to elucidate the pathophysiology of depression and to identify rapid, efficacious antidepressant agents.
These structural alterations are difficult to reverse with typical antidepressants.
However, recent studies demonstrate that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that produces rapid antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant depressed patients, rapidly increases spine synapses in the PFC and reverses the deficits caused by chronic stress.
This is thought to occur by disinhibition of glutamate transmission, resulting in a rapid but transient burst of glutamate, followed by an increase in BDNF release and activation of downstream signaling pathways that stimulate synapse formation.
Recent work demonstrates that the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist, are also associated with increased glutamate transmission and synapse formation.
Together these studies have created tremendous excitement and hope for a new generation of rapid, efficacious antidepressants.


Abstract
Risk for adult psychiatric disorders is partially determined by early-life alterations occurring during neural circuit formation and maturation.
In this perspective, recent data show that the serotonin system regulates key cellular processes involved in the construction of cortical circuits.
Emerging data demonstrate that early-life adversity induces epigenetic modifications in serotonin-related genes.
These approaches are providing new insights on the biological mechanisms and clinical application of antidepressants.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major public health concern.
Despite tremendous advances, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with MDD are still unclear.
The role of miRNAs in disease pathophysiology is emerging rapidly.
Recent studies demonstrating the involvement of miRNAs in several aspects of neural plasticity, neurogenesis, and stress response, and more direct studies in human postmortem brain provide strong evidence that miRNAs can not only play a critical role in MDD pathogenesis, but can also open up new avenues for the development of therapeutic targets.
Circulating miRNAs are now being considered as possible biomarkers in disease pathogenesis and in monitoring therapeutic responses because of the presence and/or release of miRNAs in blood cells as well as in other peripheral tissues.
In this review, these aspects are discussed in a comprehensive and critical manner.


Abstract
Omics technologies emerged as complementary strategies to genomics in the attempt to understand human illnesses.


Abstract
Little was known about the neural mechanisms mediating such alterations before the advent of functional neuroimaging techniques.
Since the turn of the new millenium, several functional neuroimaging studies have been conducted to tackle this important issue.
Some of these studies have explored the neural impact of various forms of psychotherapy in individuals with major depressive disorder.
Other neuroimaging studies have investigated the effects of psychological interventions for anxiety disorders.
I review these studies in the present article, and discuss the putative neural mechanisms of change in psychotherapy.
The findings of these studies suggest that mental and behavioral changes occurring during psychotherapeutic interventions can lead to a normalization of functional brain activity at a global level.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder is a worldwide disease with debilitating effects on a patient's life.
Common treatments include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy.
Many patients do not respond to these treatments; this has led to the investigation of alternative therapeutic modalities.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one of these modalities.
Further, neuroimaging has played a pivotal role in identifying some DBS targets and remains an important tool for evaluating the mechanism of action of this novel intervention.


Abstract
Synchronized neuronal activity in the cortex generates weak electric fields that are routinely measured in humans and animal models by electroencephalography and local field potential recordings.
Traditionally, these endogenous electric fields have been considered to be an epiphenomenon of brain activity.
Recent work has demonstrated that active cortical networks are surprisingly susceptible to weak perturbations of the membrane voltage of a large number of neurons by electric fields.
This review aims to interface the recent developments in the study of both endogenous and exogenous electric fields, with a particular focus on rhythmic stimulation for the modulation of cortical oscillations.
The main goal is to provide a starting point for the use of rational design for the development of novel mechanism-based TCS therapeutics based on transcranial alternating current stimulation, for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses.


Abstract
Recent advances in imaging technology and in the understanding of neural circuits relevant to emotion, motivation, and depression have boosted interest and experimental work in neuromodulation for affective disorders.

The scope of his work covers neurophysiology, pharmacology, psychiatry, and psychosomatics.


Abstract
Psychiatric emergencies are stressful and time-consuming for physicians.
Comprehensive diagnostic assessment is often not feasible in psychiatric emergency situations.
Primary interventions target symptoms and syndromes.
Treatments for psychiatric emergencies often lack an evidence base and rely on expert opinions and good clinical practice.
Target symptoms for interventions in emergency situations are agitation, aggressive behavior, delirious states, psychotic symptoms and anxiety (psychotic or non-psychotic).
Pharmacological treatments are indicated due to their sedative, antipsychotic, and anxiolytic effects.
It is important to look for possible medical causes and comorbidity (differential diagnosis).
The treatment of delirium should always focus on any underlying medical conditions.
Psychiatric emergencies require immediate action by a physician, although the options available are often limited.
If an emergency situation can be converted into a crisis situation by means of a successful intervention, additional time is gained and the range of options for action may be widened.


Abstract
Due to new offers in prenatal diagnostics pregnant women are forced to make choices.
In Switzerland physicians are obliged to inform previous to prenatal tests and to obtain informed consent.


Abstract
Telemedicine comprises different concepts aiming to close a spatial distance between practitioner, medical staff and patient.
Its functionality can include mere data transmission but extend as well to triggering alarms or enable consultation and therapy suggestions.
A special form of telemedicinal application is interventional decentralized telemonitoring.
Here practitioner-patient communication is characterized by telemedicinal data collection driven therapy-control and -optimization.
To identify feasible indications for the employment of telemonitoring a detailed definition of communicated parameters, alarm rules and algorithms of intervention are required as well as a benefit-cost analysis.
The quality of the telemedical application is determined by the medical quality of the resulting actions.


Abstract
The small intestine was in the left hemiabdomen dorsal to the abomasum and caudodorsal to the rumen at the first two examinations.
The location of the caecum varied from dorsal to the spiral colon to adjacent to the right abdominal wall with the apex always pointing caudally.
The rectum was easily identified in the pelvic region.
The size, volume and density of the described organs throughout the study are shown in several tables.


Abstract
There is limited evidence that doxylamine-pyridoxine is more effective than pyridoxine alone.
The role of doxylamine-pyridoxine as the first-line pharmacological treatment for NVP in Canada should be reconsidered.


Abstract
Burns from domestic irons are potentially preventable injuries which can result in significant morbidity.
Several studies have reported these injuries in children but there are no reports to date in adults.
Epidemiology, management and outcome of these injuries is described, and possible preventative strategies are discussed.
We present a retrospective case note review of 50 adult and paediatric patients with electric iron burns.
Cases were identified from data collected for a national burns database.
Information regarding demographics, burn characteristics, treatment and long term outcome was gathered from the medical records.
42 children and 8 adults sustained a burn from an iron during the 4-year study period.
The majority of paediatric patients were under 4 years of age.
Most burns were small (< 1% TBSA) but despite this 30 (60%) patients were admitted to hospital and 13 (26%) required at least one surgical procedure.
In children, most burns occurred at home and were commonly due to pulling the flex or knocking the iron from its surface.
In adults, 50% of injuries were associated with epilepsy.
Burns from domestic irons are relatively common and cause significant morbidity despite their small size.
A bimodal presentation is seen with injuries occurring either before the age of 4 years or during adulthood, when they are typically associated with an underlying medical condition.
Education campaigns and design features such as a retractable cord may further reduce the incidence of this type of burn.


Abstract
This retrospective analysis of neonatal burn injuries was carried out at the Department of Plastic Surgery and Burn Care Centre, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, Pakistan.
A total of 11 neonates who were aged less than 29 days were managed during the 2 year study period.
Out of these, 72.7% (8) were male and 27.3% (3) were female.
The TBSA burnt ranged from 3%-55%, with a mean of 18.72±17.13%.
All the neonates (100%) presented during winter season.
Among the body areas affected, the most common was face/head and neck (10).
The commonest operative procedure undertaken among the neonates included early wound excision followed by resurfacing with split thickness autografts (5).
There were three in-hospital mortalities (27.2%) in our series.


Abstract
Bacterial translocation after major burns plays an important role in burn sepsis and can be reduced with SDD.
30 patients with burns of 25-50% TBSA were divided into 2 groups.
Group I received SDD regimen in the form of amikacin, miconazole, and colistin sulphate.
Group II served as a control group.
SDD treatment resulted in significant control of infectious episodes and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
It also resulted in a reduction of mortality, although this was not statistically significant.
Despite the statistical insignificance of the improved mortality rate, SDD treatment seems to be a useful tool in treating this group of highly critical patients.


Abstract
Carbapenem resistance due to acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) is considered to be more serious than other resistance mechanisms.


Abstract
Hypertrophic burn scars pose a challenge for burn survivors and providers.
In many cases, they can severely limit a burn survivor's level of function, including work and recreational activities.
A widespread modality of prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scarring is the utilization of pressure garment therapy (PGT).
In this review, we attempt to summarize and analyze evidence-based literature on PGT and its efficacy in burn hypertrophic scars published in English language in the past 15 years.


Abstract
Psychiatric disorders may be more common in burn-injured subjects than in the general population, and oftentimes contribute to the injury itself.
Even in the absence of underlying psychiatric illnesses, burn patients may still benefit from a psychiatric evaluation during and after their hospitalization.
In this regard, we included a dedicated psychiatry service in our multidisciplinary burn team.
We review herein the course of burn patients that were offered psychiatric evaluation and highlight the benefits of such a program.
We conducted an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of burn subjects admitted to our institution between June 15, 2009 and April 30, 2010 and identified 83 patients that were examined by our psychiatrist.
Indications for consultation, history of psychiatric illness and substance abuse, as well as administered drugs, were recorded.
Among the 83 evaluated patients, 48 (57.8%) had a preexisting psychiatric disorder and 36 (43.4%) suffered from substance abuse.
The most common indications for consultation were pain (28.1%), alcohol dependence (25.8%), anxiety (24.7%), illicit drug abuse (16.8%), depression (15.7%), post-traumatic stress disorder (8.9%), and sleep disturbances (8.9%).
Pharmacotherapy was initiated in 75 patients (90.3%).
31 (37.3%) had neither a psychiatric disorder nor a history of substance abuse, although 26 of them (83.9%) still received drugs for psychiatric conditions.
The inclusion of a dedicated psychiatrist as part of our burn team has improved our comprehensive burn care.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, even in the absence of preexisting psychiatric illnesses, consultation resulted in pharmacologic intervention and enhanced patient care.


Abstract
Suicide is a global public health problem, particularly in Asia where few countries with large populations have high suicide rates accounting for the majority of the world's suicides.
During a 14-year period, 76 individuals, aged 17 to 66 years, committed suicide from 1995 to 2008 and were included in this report.
Data was collected on each patient including, age, sex, place of injury, patient occupation, accommodation, psychiatric illness, suicidal motives, flammable substances used, place of burn, season of the year, and total body surface area (TBSA) burnt.
Most suicidal cases (55 out of 76) had a history of depressive episodes and emotional unstable disorders, and 18 of them had a known history of psychiatric illness.
In 5 cases alcohol intoxication was present at the moment of suicide, and 3 patients had chronic alcohol dependence together with basic psychiatric disease.
It is also evident from this study that the causes of suicide in females are mainly socio-economical and psychological.


Abstract
According to many scientists and clinicians, genomics is taking on a key role in the field of medicine.
Indeed, each genome is the ultimate identifier of its owner and, due to its nature, it contains highly personal and privacy-sensitive data.


Abstract
Relentless progress in our knowledge of the nature and functional consequences of human genetic variation allows for a better understanding of the protracted battle between pathogens and their human hosts.


Abstract
Progress in genomics with, in particular, high throughput next generation sequencing is revolutionizing oncology.
In both cases, next generation sequencing techniques allow a global approach whereby the integrality of the genome mutations is analyzed and correlated with the clinical data.
The benefits on the quality of care delivered to our patients are extremely impressive.


Abstract
At any age, disabling hearing impairment has a profound impact on interpersonal communication, psychosocial well-being, quality of life and economic independence.
According to the World Health Organization's estimates, the number of people with such impairment increased from 42 million in 1985 to about 360 million in 2011.
This last figure includes 7.5 million children less than 5 years of age.
In 1995, a "roadmap" for curtailing the burden posed by disabling hearing impairment was outlined in a resolution of the World Health Assembly.
While the underlying principle of this roadmap remains valid and relevant, some updating is required to reflect the prevailing epidemiologic transition.
We examine the traditional concept and grades of disabling hearing impairment - within the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - as well as the modifications to grading that have recently been proposed by a panel of international experts.
The opportunity offered by the emerging global and high-level interest in promoting disability-inclusive post-2015 development goals and disability-free child survival is also discussed.
Since the costs of rehabilitative services are so high as to be prohibitive in low- and middle-income countries, the critical role of primary prevention is emphasized.
If the goals outlined in the World Health Assembly's 1995 resolution on the prevention of hearing impairment are to be reached by Member States, several effective country-level initiatives - including the development of public-private partnerships, strong leadership and measurable time-bound targets - will have to be implemented without further delay.


Abstract
Overall survival of patients with uveal metastasis is limited, averaging six to twelve months.


Abstract
The prevalence of insomnia increases with age.


Abstract
Previous research has highlighted the importance of addressing the social determinants of health to improve child health outcomes.
General practice recommendations to help the health care provider link patients to the community are insufficient.
Simple interventions, such as routine referral to early-year centres and selected referral to public health home-visiting programs, may help to address populations with the greatest needs.


Abstract
Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in neonates can result in devastating outcomes, including mortality and significant morbidity.
All infants are potentially at risk for neonatal HSV infection.
This position statement reviews epidemiology, transmission and risk factors, with a focus on intrapartum infection.
It considers diagnosis and prognosis according to infection category, along with testing modalities and limitations.
Guidance is provided for the empirical management of infants with suspected clinical sepsis, including those who do not respond to antibacterial therapy.
The present statement replaces a 2006 position statement by the Canadian Paediatric Society.


Abstract
Red blood cell transfusion is an important and frequent component of neonatal intensive care.
The present position statement addresses the methods and indications for red blood cell transfusion of the newborn, based on a review of the current literature.
The most frequent indications for blood transfusion in the newborn are the acute treatment of perinatal hemorrhagic shock and the recurrent correction of anemia of prematurity.
Perinatal hemorrhagic shock requires immediate treatment with large quantities of red blood cells; the effects of massive transfusion on other blood components must be considered.
Although the risks of transfusion have declined considerably in recent years, they can be minimized further by carefully restricting neonatal blood sampling.


Abstract
Antimicrobial stewardship is a recent concept that embodies the practical, judicious use of antimicrobials to decrease adverse outcomes from antimicrobials while optimizing the treatment of bacterial infections to reduce the emergence of resistant pathogens.
The objectives of the present statement are to illustrate the principles of antimicrobial stewardship and to offer practical examples of how to make antimicrobial stewardship part of everyday hospital and outpatient practice.
Other specific, important actions include questioning whether positive urine cultures are contaminated when there is no evidence of pyuria or inflammatory changes, and obtaining a chest radiograph to support a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.
Optimizing the choice and dosage of antimicrobials also reduces the probability of clinical failures and subsequent courses of antimicrobials.
A list of common clinical scenarios to promote stew-ardship is included.


Abstract
Children with asplenia or hyposplenia are at risk of developing overwhelming sepsis.


Abstract
A DNA marker for selection of resistance to F18+ E. coli in the pig is available since several years.
The use of this marker decreases mortality due to post-weaning diarrhoea and/or oedema disease.
However, for most diseases such as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD), resistance is a complex and polygenic trait.
Novel technologies such as gene microarrays and advanced bioinformatics are being used to analyse health data.
As the pig genome is sequenced to a great extent and ten thousands of markers can be analysed at a reasonable price, genomic selection for health traits is possible.


Abstract
The prevalence of pectinate ligament dysplasia was evaluated in a prospective multi-center examination of randomly selected Golden retrievers of variable sex and age.
The examinations were carried out by qualified veterinary ophthalmologists between May 1 and May 31, 2013.
A total of 92 dogs (29 male and 62 female dogs) were examined.
The dogs were between 6 months and 14 years old (4.53 ± 3.02 years).
The average total score for all quadrants was 2.14 ± 0.95.
There was no significant difference between left and right eyes, however, a significant difference was found between female and male dogs, as well as between young dogs and older dogs.
The width of the drainage angle decreased with age and the degree of mesodermal dysplasia increased.


Abstract
The practice of combining pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy is advocated for as treatment of choice for many psychiatric disorders.
This case report follows the treatment course of a fourteen-year-old young woman initially diagnosed with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) and provisional Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
It demonstrates the benefits, drawbacks, possible pitfalls and successful outcome of combined therapy, an outcome which may not have been achieved had only one of the modalities been used.


Abstract
Here we give some recommendations based on our experience of the last fifteen years.

This article analyzes the basic principles of point-of-care lung ultrasound and all the supposed limitations to the diagnostic usefulness of this technique.


Abstract
The Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHR Act) came into effect in 2004.
Ten years later, Health Canada still has not drafted the regulations governing reimbursement.
Section 12 is therefore still not in force.
Health Canada and others have asserted that there is a Health Canada policy on reimbursement and that reimbursement with receipts is legally permissible.
We dispute the existence of such a policy and its legitimacy (if it exists).
We also challenge the decision by Health Canada not to produce regulations and thereby make it possible for Parliament to bring s.12 into force.
This intentional lack of action is worrisome on at least two fronts.
First, it sidesteps the processes required for regulations and thereby ducks the Parliamentary oversight very deliberately built into the AHR Act.
Second, it leaves Canadians who provide and who access assisted human reproduction uncertain about what is and is not permitted, and therefore fearful of, or at risk of, prosecution.
Canadians should demand no less.


Abstract
The ethical issues include multiple aspects of informed decision-making, such as access to counselling about the possible results of the test in advance of making a decision about participation in NIPT.
Policy considerations include issues related to offering and promoting a privately available medical strategy in publicly funded institutions.
Ethics and policy considerations merge in NIPT with regard to sex selection and support for persons living with disabilities.


Abstract
Their application in large databases has improved our understanding of the importance of intrauterine growth restriction and its antenatal recognition.


Abstract
However, most previous studies only assessed the presence of startle using data collected from the neck muscles and head/neck kinematics.
The startle response also evokes a descending pattern of muscle recruitment and changes in autonomic activity.
Here we examined the recruitment of axial and appendicular muscles along with autonomic responses to confirm whether these other features of a startle response were present during the first exposure to a whiplash perturbation.
Ten subjects experienced a single whiplash perturbation while recording electromyography, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal responses.
All subjects exhibited a descending pattern of muscle recruitment, and increasing heart rate and electrodermal responses following the collision.
Our results provide further support that the startle response is a component of the response to whiplash collisions.


Abstract
It is well-established that the coordination of muscular activity in the lumbopelvic region is vital to the generation of mechanical spinal stability.
Several models illustrating mechanisms by which dysfunctional neuromuscular control strategies may serve as a cause and/or effect of low back pain have been described in the literature.


Abstract
One of these factors is neurological dysfunction.
Increase in body sway has been observed either during or following sensory manipulation in AIS patients.
Impairment in sensory processing could induce a body schema distortion.
The aim of this case series was to evaluate if conventional orthopaedic treatments could improve balance control thus implying a better body representation.


Abstract
We determined whether spinal manipulation could prevent and/or reverse the decrease and increase in paraspinal muscle spindle responsiveness caused respectively by lengthening and shortening histories of the lumbar muscles.


Abstract
Somatosensory evoked potentionals (SEPs) can be used to elucidate differences in cortical activity associated with a spinal manipulation (SM) intervention.
The purpose of this narrative review is to overview the origin and application of SEPs, a neurophysiological technique to investigate neuroplasticity.
Understanding what SEPs are, and their application allows chiropractors, educators, and other manual therapists interested in SM to understand the context, and importance of research findings from SM studies that involve SEPs.


Abstract
The role of posterior cervical musculature in sensorimotor control, cervicocephalic pain, and stabilization of the spinal cord has been recently described.
These myodural bridges provide passive and active anchoring of the spinal cord.
They may also be involved in a dural tension monitoring system to prevent dural infolding, and maintain patency of the spinal cord.
Modulation of dural tension may be initiated via a sensory reflex to muscular contractile tissues.
Unanticipated movements such as hyperflexion extension injuries stimulate deep suboccipital muscles and transmit tensile forces through the bridge to the cervical dura.
Due to its larger cross sectional area, the rectus capitis posterior major myodural bridge may exert greater mechanical traction on the dura than the rectus capitis posterior minor.
University ethics committee approval and anatomical donor consent was obtained for this study.


Abstract
A form of chiropractic procedure known as Cox flexion-distraction is used by chiropractors to treat low back pain.
Patient lies face down on a specially designed table having a stationery thoracic support and a moveable caudal support for the legs.
The Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) holds a manual contact applying forces over the posterior lumbar spine and press down on the moving leg support to create traction effects in the lumbar spine.
This paper reports on the development of real-time feedback on the applied forces during the application of the flexion-distraction procedure.
In this pilot study we measured the forces applied by experienced DCs as well as novice DCs in using this procedure.
After a brief training with real-time feedback novice DCs have improved on the magnitude of the applied forces.
This real-time feedback technology is promising to do systematic studies in training DCs during the application of this procedure.


Abstract
Maternal and child morbidity and mortality are a major public health, development and human rights challenge globally and in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.
The Region is diverse, with high-, middle- and low- income countries, many suffering from political instability, conflicts and other complex development challenges.
In answer to the question whether we can reduce the burden of maternal and child morbidity and mortality in the Region: yes, we can.
However, commitment and collaboration are needed at the country, regional and international levels.


Abstract
Community participation eludes Pakistan's maternal, newborn and child health programme.
This study looked at the comprehensiveness of the primary health care approach being applied in Pakistan's National Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) Programme launched in 2005.
The methods included a review of the programme's guideline documents, in-depth interviews with managers/advisors and focus group discussions with community groups and service providers.
The MNCH Programme is applying a selective primary care model.
Programme advisors and managers were concerned about the quality of training, political interference and incomplete implementation.
Service providers were not working together as envisioned.
Community midwives complained about the community's perceptions of them.
Community members were unaware of MNCH Programme implementation in their areas.
Pakistan's primary health care programme needs to be reviewed and revised according current thinking on community participation and inter-sectoral collaboration to accelerate progress towards achievement of Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5.


Abstract
Expanding the comprehensive national neonatal screening programme in the United Arab Emirates from 1995 to 2011.
This paper reports data since the programme started in January 1995 up to December 2011 on the incidence of screened disorders and the molecular basis of positive screened cases.
Screening used a combination of tandem mass spectrometry, molecular technologies and biochemical analysis.
A total of 750 365 infants were screened and 717 babies saved from associated morbidity and/or mortality.
Coverage of neonatal screening in the population reached 95% in 2010.


Abstract
Prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months of life in Tehran: a population-based study.
Exclusive breastfeeding is the best form of nutrition for infants in the first 6 months of life.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran in the first 6 months of life, and the factors that influence it.
In a population-based, cross-sectional study 538 mothers with children aged 6-24 months completed an interview questionnaire.
Only 46.5% of mothers exclusively breastfed their infant in the first 6 months of life.
In multivariate analysis formula supplementation in the hospital (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.17-0.95) and mother receiving conflicting infant feeding advice (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.37-0.78) had a negative effect on exclusive breastfeeding.
Mother's intention to exclusively breastfeed (OR = 5.85, 95% CI: 2.88-11.9) and infant having first breast contact 6-30 minutes after delivery (OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.17-4.72) had positive effects on exclusive breastfeeding.


Abstract
Prevalence of anaemia in preschool children in Karma Albalad area, Northern State, Sudan.
Anaemia is a major childhood health problem in developing countries.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the prevalence of anaemia, and some of its determinants, in preschool children in a rural village in the Northern State of Sudan.
All children aged 3-6 years attending the 4 village kindergartens on the day of the study were enrolled.
Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using a questionnaire completed by parents, and blood samples were taken for haemoglobin measurement.
Out of 163 children, 131 had anaemia (haemoglobin level < 11 g/dL), a prevalence of 80.4%.
This figure is comparable to data from other developing countries.
The prevalence of anaemia was not significantly associated with any of the studied demographic and socioeconomic factors (sex, economic status of the family, mother's literacy or family size) or health of the child (history of pica or number of attacks of malaria in the last year).
A campaign to tackle this serious health issue is urgently needed.


Abstract
Association between dietary habits and body mass index of adolescent females in intermediate schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Obesity among Saudi youth is a growing public health challenge.
This cross-sectional study measured body mass index (BMI) and determined the eating habits and lifestyle of 107 randomly selected female adolescent students (age 12-15 years) at schools in Riyadh.
The students' heights and weights were measured and a pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data on diet and lifestyle.
The majority of the students' families had monthly income > 10 000 riyals (US$ 1 = 3.75 riyals).
About half the students (53.3%) were within normal weight, 28.6% were underweight, 12.4% overweight and 5.7% obese.
The majority of the students did not have healthy dietary or exercise habits.
There were no significant differences between BMI category and dietary pattern and lifestyle.
Increasing educational programmes with healthy dietary concepts to improve the dietary pattern of female adolescents is recommended.


Abstract
Serological tests for Toxoplasma gondii are inadequate because antibody production either fails or is significantly delayed.
Serums samples were taken from 130 pregnant women at risk of toxoplasmosis and a control group of 25 women with normal pregnancy.
Of 50 IgM- and/or IgG-positive samples, only 15 showed low IgG-avidity antibodies.
PCR was performed on 25 selected samples.
Toxoplasma DNA was detected in 15/15 IgM-positive with low IgG-avidity and 1/3 IgM-positive with high IgG-avidity.
None of the IgM-negative with high IgG-avidity showed any Toxoplasma DNA.


Abstract
The prevalence of coeliac disease among patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism has not been studied before in Jordan and other Arab countries.
A cross-sectional record-based review was made of all adult autoimmune hypothyroidism patients who attended a referral centre in Jordan, during an 8-month period.
Coeliac disease in these patients was diagnosed by the attending physician based on positive serological tests for anti-endomysial antibodies IgA and IgG followed by duodenal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of coeliac disease.
Of 914 patients recruited, 117 (12.8%) were seropositive for coeliac disease.
Of 87 seropositive patients who underwent duodenal biopsy, 39 had positive histological findings of coeliac disease (44.8%).
Extrapolating from these findings the overall rate of coeliac disease among autoimmune hypothyroidism patients was estimated to be 5.7%.
In multivariate logistic regression coeliac disease was significantly associated with older age (> 40 years), presence of other autoimmune diseases, vitamin B12 deficiency and anaemia.


Abstract
Physicians' knowledge, attitude and practices regarding management of medications in Ramadan.
A total of 297 questionnaires were returned.
Physicians' KAP about management of medications in Ramadan was generally insufficient.
The main factors that affected KAP were age, nationality, specialty, and country and year of last qualification (P < 0.05).
Female physicians scored better than males, and fellows scored better than other groups for knowledge.


Abstract
Falls in the elderly are common with consecutive high mortality and morbidity.
Sarcopenia, imbalance and gait disorders represent the major risk factors.
Sarcopenia is caused by a disequilibrium of protein synthesis and breakdown, probably in consequence of age-related changes in protein metabolism.
Protein supplements in combination with strength training shows the best benefit.
Disorders in balance and gait are caused by age-related or pathologic changes in a complex regulation system of gait.
The individual fall risk correlates with the gait variability and even increases with bad dual task performance.
Activities with high requirements of attention and body awareness are the most effective prevention for falls in the elderly (-50%).

Abstract
The changes being observed in the distribution of the burden of diseases and injuries--such as recent increases in the incidence of road traffic injuries--are matters of concern.
BRICS may need stronger institutional capacity to address such changes in a timely way.
In this paper, we present data on road traffic injuries in BRICS and illustrate the enormous challenge that these countries currently face in reducing the incidence of such injuries.
There is an urgent need to improve road safety indicators in every country constituting BRICS.
It is imperative for BRICS to invest in system-wide road safety interventions and reduce the mortality and morbidity from road traffic injuries.


Abstract
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa--the countries known as BRICS--represent some of the world's fastest growing large economies and nearly 40% of the world's population.
Over the last two decades, BRICS have undertaken health-system reforms to make progress towards universal health coverage.
This paper discusses three key aspects of these reforms: the role of government in financing health; the underlying motivation behind the reforms; and the value of the lessons learnt for non-BRICS countries.
Although national governments have played a prominent role in the reforms, private financing constitutes a major share of health spending in BRICS.
There is a reliance on direct expenditures in China and India and a substantial presence of private insurance in Brazil and South Africa.
The Brazilian health reforms resulted from a political movement that made health a constitutional right, whereas those in China, India, the Russian Federation and South Africa were an attempt to improve the performance of the public system and reduce inequities in access.
The move towards universal health coverage has been slow.
In China and India, the reforms have not adequately addressed the issue of out-of-pocket payments.
Negotiations between national and subnational entities have often been challenging but Brazil has been able to achieve good coordination between federal and state entities via a constitutional delineation of responsibility.
In the Russian Federation, poor coordination has led to the fragmented pooling and inefficient use of resources.
In mixed health systems it is essential to harness both public and private sector resources.


Abstract
Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa--the countries known as BRICS--have made considerable progress in vaccine production, regulation and development over the past 20 years.
By 2014, all five countries had strong initiatives for the development of vaccine technology and had greatly improved their national regulatory capacity.
South Africa was then the only BRICS country that was not completely producing vaccines.
South Africa is now in the process of re-establishing its own vaccine production and passing beyond the stage of simply importing, formulating and filling vaccine bulks.
Changes in the public sector's price per dose of selected vaccines, the global market share represented by products from specific manufacturers, and the attractiveness, for multinational companies, of partnership and investment opportunities in BRICS companies have all been analysed.
The results indicate that the BRICS countries have had a major impact on vaccine price and availability, with much of that impact attributable to the output of Indian vaccine manufacturers.
China is expected to have a greater impact soon, given the anticipated development of Chinese vaccine manufacturers in the near future.
BRICS' accomplishments in the field of vaccine development are expected to reshape the global vaccine market and accelerate access to vaccines in the developing world.
The challenge is to turn these expectations into strategic actions and practical outcomes.


Abstract
Dental professionals are in a unique position to promote smoking cessation among their patients.
We evaluated the effects of a brief counselling intervention by a dentist on patients' attitude towards the role of dentists in tobacco cessation programmes.
In a semi-experimental study in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 70 eligible smokers were selected and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups.
The initial attitudes of the patients regarding tobacco cessation counselling services provided by the dentist were determined using a validated questionnaire.
The intervention group received a brief chair-side counselling by a dentist based on the 5 A's approach, while no intervention was provided for the control group.
At 8-weeks follow-up, smokers receiving the intervention showed significantly more positive attitudes towards the role of the dentist in advising patients to quit smoking compared with those in the control group.
More responsibility could be transferred to dentists for tobacco prevention.


Abstract
Attitudes of dental patients towards participation in research.
The attitudes of dental patients towards participation in research and the independent socioeconomic factors associated with these attitudes are not known.
A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 120 patients attending dental clinics in Amman, Jordan.
For patients who had previously participated in research (n = 28), motivating factors for most (> 75%) included a desire to help others and to advance science.
Reasons given for not participating in research included fear of infectious diseases (71.3%) and pain (62.1%).
Factors considered important in enhancing research participation included being asked to give informed consent (98.2%), fairness in selection of participants (97.3%) and the prospect of humanitarian benefit (96.5%).
Sex and education level were significantly associated with patients' perceptions for several of items.
To enhance recruitment, researchers should be aware of people's perspectives regarding participation in research.


Abstract
Perceptions, attitudes, and practices towards research among resident physicians in training in Saudi Arabia.
Health research training forms an important part of medical education.
This cross-sectional study examined the attitudes to research, perceived barriers to research and experience of participation in research projects among resident physicians in Saudi Arabia.
A self-administered email questionnaire was completed by 191/207 residents working in different specialties and regions of Riyadh.
A majority (97.9%) agreed that research is essential and improves health care and 86.9% that it helps in building a future academic career.
Lack of research training (93.2%), lack of time (89.5%), work-related stress (83.2%) and lack of supervisors (73.3%) were perceived barriers to doing research.
Only 58 (30.4%) had had any research involvement.


Abstract
Quality of documentation of electronic medical information systems at primary health care units in Alexandria, Egypt.
Limited data are available about the implementation of electronic records systems in primary care in developing countries.
The present study aimed to assess the quality of documentation in the electronic medical records at primary health care units in Alexandria, Egypt and to elicit physician's feedback on barriers and facilitators to the system.
Data were collected at 7 units selected randomly from each administrative region and in each unit 50 paper-based records and their corresponding e-records were randomly selected for patients who visited the unit in the first 3 months of 2011.
Administrative data were almost complete in both paper and e-records, but the completeness of clinical data varied between 60.0% and 100.0% across different units and types of record.
The accuracy rate of the main diagnosis in e-records compared with paper-based records ranged between 44.0% and 82.0%.
High workload and system complexity were the most frequently mentioned barriers to implementation of the e-records system.


Abstract
Capacity building of public health laboratories in Afghanistan: challenges and successes (2007-2011).
The continuing state of conflict and the resulting devastation of infrastructure have made Afghanistan exceptionally vulnerable to disease epidemics.
The paper reports initiatives by the United States Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 to promote capacity building in a number of key medical laboratories and enable the Afghans to detect emerging and re-emerging diseases of public health importance.
Equipment, supplies and laboratory staff training were critical for disease diagnosis and fulfillment of obligations of the International Health Regulations 2005.
Accordingly, many diseases outbreaks were recently identified, including avian and pandemic influenza, febrile illness, watery diarrhoea, jaundice and leishmaniasis.
Clinical samples and disease vectors were collected for analysis, and microbial isolates were obtained for further characterization.
The expanded range and enhanced accuracy of laboratory procedures have facilitated selected local laboratories to monitor, detect, identify, assess, contain and respond to public health threats.
Nevertheless, policies of sustainability and infectious diseases control need continuous support and emphasis.


Abstract
Tuberculosis awareness in Gezira, Sudan: knowledge, attitude and practice case-control survey.
This case-control study aimed to assess tuberculosis (TB) awareness and its associated sociodemographic characteristics in Gezira, Sudan.
New smear-positive TB patients registered in Gezira in 2010 (n = 425) and age-matched controls who attended the same health facilities for other reasons (n = 850) formed the study sample.
Awareness was measured using a modified standard World Health Organization TB knowledge, attitude and practice instrument.
There was no significant difference between TB cases and the controls in overall levels of TB awareness.
About two-thirds of TB cases and controls had good TB awareness.
Age, level of education, type of residence and type of occupation were significantly associated with TB awareness, whereas marital status had no effect.

Abstract
Factors influencing parental consent for participation in clinical research involving their children in Egypt.
Factors affecting parents' decision to involve their children in clinical research have not been studied in all cultural backgrounds.
Of 523 families approached, 357 filled the questionnaire.
Only 98 (27.5%) parents consented to involve their child in clinical research.
The children of consenters were significantly older than refusers: 8.6 (SD 7.2) versus 2.6 (SD 1.2) years.
Factors favouring consent were: research of benefit to child (84.7%), enough explanation about the benefits (40.8%) and to learn more about child's condition (29.6%).
Factors favouring refusal were: use of new drugs or vaccines (89.6%) and invasive procedures (84.2%).
Parents' rate of consent was positively correlated with the research being non-invasive and the belief that research was of benefit to their child and negatively correlated with belief that refusal may negatively affect the care provided to their child.


Abstract
Epidemiological survey on pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in Kurdistan province, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2009.
This study evaluated the epidemiology of suspected cases of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in 2009-2010 in Kurdistan province, a frontier province of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
A questionnaire covering demographic characteristics, clinical presentation and outcome, and history of exposure and travel was completed by patients attending health centres and hospitals in the province.
Nasal and throat swabs were analysed by RT-PCR.
A total of 1059 suspected cases were assessed; H1N1 influenza A was confirmed in 157 (14.8%).
The highest proportion of confirmed cases was 30.0%, among children aged < 1 year.
In multivariate analysis, previous contact with symptomatic influenza patients (OR = 2.17) and hospitalization (OR = 3.88) were the only significant risk factors for confirmed H1N1 infection.
Age, sex, residency, presenting symptoms and history of national or international travel were not significant.
Influenza A (H1N1) virus has spread in Islamic Republic of Iran; probably transmitted by travellers to Kurdistan.


Abstract
Stressful life events experienced by pregnant women may lead to adverse obstetric outcomes.
This study in Benghazi compared the rates of preterm, low-birth-weight and caesarean-section births at Al-Jamhouria hospital in the months before and during the armed conflict in Libya in 2011.
Data were collected on all women admitted to the delivery ward during February to May 2011 (the months of the most active fighting in the city) (n = 7096), and October to December 2010 (the months immediately before the war) (n = 5935).
Compared with the preceding months there was a significant rise during the conflict in the rate of deliveries involving preterm (3.6% versus 2.5%) and low-birth-weight (10.1% versus 8.5%) infants and caesarean sections (26.9% versus 25.3%).
Psychosocial stress may have been a factor (among others) in an increase in negative pregnancy outcomes, and obstetric hospitals should be aware of these issues in times of war.


Abstract
Rate and correlates of depression among elderly people attending primary health care centres in Al-Dakhiliyah governorate, Oman.
This study determined the rates and correlates of depression among community-dwelling elderly people, based on data from the comprehensive health assessment conducted in Al-Dakhiliyah governorate in Oman in 2008-2010.
Data covered sociodemographic characteristics, medical and nutrition status, functional abilities, depression and dementia.
The rate of depression was 16.9%, higher among women than men (19.3% versus 14.3%).
Depression was independently predicted by the presence of social risk (OR = 3.44), dementia (OR = 3.17), impairment in activities of daily living (OR = 2.19), joint problems (OR = 1.52) and mobility restriction (OR = 1.43).
Although not presenting as a complaint, depression in not uncommon among elderly people.


Abstract
Reliability and validity of the Persian (Farsi) version of the Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus.
Knowledge of patients' risk perceptions is essential for the management of chronic diseases.
This study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of a Persian (Farsi) language translation of the Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus.
After forward-backward translation the RPS-DM was randomly administered to 106 adult patients with diabetes who were enrolled in a teaching referral clinic in the north of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Rasht).
Internal consistency and exploratory factor analysis were applied.
The minimum value for internal consistency was 0.50 for risk knowledge and the highest value was 0.88 on the optimistic bias subscale.
Principal component analysis showed that the items of the composite risk score matched with the same items in the English language version, except for question numbers 16, 24 and 25.
The Persian version of RPS-DM is the first standardized tool for measuring risk perception and knowledge about diabetes complications in the Islamic Republic of Iran.


Abstract
Knowledge of and attitudes towards periodontal health among adults in Tehran.
This study aimed to assess knowledge of and attitudes towards periodontal health among adults in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.
We conducted a cross-sectional face-to-face interview survey in 2011 of 791 adults aged 18-50 years using a stratified, multistage sampling method.
We recorded demographic characteristics including age, sex, education, marital status, employment and economic status (housing density).
The lowest percentage of correct answers was related to the definition of dental plaque (11.6%) and the highest was for the role of the dental visit in prevention (92.8%).
Female sex, university education and higher economic status were significantly associated with a higher mean score on periodontal health knowledge.
The regression analysis showed that positive attitudes were associated with higher periodontal health knowledge and having university education.
In this study positive attitudes towards prevention were related to better knowledge.


Abstract
This study determined the prevalence of MDR A. baumannii isolates from intensive care units in a large tertiary-care hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, and the occurrence of different beta-lactamases in these isolates.
Biotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility profile was done for isolated strains.
Respiratory, urine, burn wound and blood specimens were collected from 350 patients admitted to different units; 10 strains (2.9%) of A. baumannii were isolated.
All isolates showed resistance to more than 3 classes of antibiotics.
Among the isolates, 6 isolates were carbapenemase producers, 2 were AmpC beta-lactamase producers and no isolates were metallo-beta-lactamase producers.
Despite the low prevalence of A. baumannii infection in this hospital, the antibiotic resistance profile suggests that prevention of health-care-associated transmission of MDR Acinetobacter spp. infection is essential.


Abstract
Knowledge and perceptions of prescribers regarding adherence to standard treatment guidelines for malaria: a comparative cross-sectional study from Pakistan.
Despite the availability of standard treatment guidelines for malaria in Pakistan adherence to protocols by prescribers is poor.
This descriptive, cross-sectional study aimed to explore the perceptions and knowledge of prescribers in Islamabad and Rawalpindi cities towards adherence to standard treatment guidelines for malaria.
A questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 360 prescribers; 64.7% were satisfied with the available antimalarial drugs and 41.3% agreed that antimalarial drugs should only be prescribed after diagnostic testing.


Abstract
Laboratory and field evaluation of two formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis M-H-14 against mosquito larvae in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2012.
In laboratory conditions, the LC50 values of wettable powder and granule formulations were 227 and 1031 ppm respectively against a susceptible strain of An. stephensi.
Following application of wettable powder and granules at 56.1 mg/aquarium, the survival rates of the exposed larvae to the granule formulation were 65.6% and 54.2% on days 6 and 8 respectively.
In the artificial ponds, the larval density was reduced to 38.9%, 39.3% and 65.1% at dosages of 2, 4 and 8 g/m(2) respectively.
In rice fields, at a dosage of 2 kg/ha, the density of immature larvae were reduced to 33.1% and 28.6% 7-days post-treatment.
Further investigations are needed for the reasons for the low efficacy of this larvicide.


Abstract
Study on validity of a rapid diagnostic test kit versus light microscopy for malaria diagnosis in Ahmedabad city, India.
Light microscopy of blood smears for diagnosis of malaria in the field has several limitations, notably delays in diagnosis.
This study in Ahmedabad in Gujarat State, India, evaluated the diagnostic performance of a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/Pan) versus blood smear examination as the gold standard.
All fever cases presenting at 13 urban health centres were subjected to rapid diagnostic testing and thick and thin blood smears.
A total of 677 cases with fever were examined; 135 (20.0%) tested positive by rapid diagnostic test and 86 (12.7%) by blood smear.
The sensitivity of the rapid diagnostic test for malaria was 98.8%, specificity was 91.5%, positive predictive value 63.0% and negative predictive value 99.8%.
For detection of Plasmodium falciparum the sensitivity of rapid diagnostic test was 100% and specificity was 97.3%.
The results show the acceptability of the rapid test as an alternative to light microscopy in the field setting.


Abstract
Schistosomiasis ranks second to malaria in terms of socioeconomic and public health importance in Yemen.
The study examined urine samples and interviewed 696 children (mean age 12.5 years) attending a primary-preparatory school in south Yemen.
Urinary schistosomiasis was confirmed in 126 (18.1%) children.
Diagnostic performance was poor for 2 items in the morbidity questionnaire (self-reported history of previous infection and self-reported history of antischistosomal treatment).
However, self-reported dysuria, self-reported haematuria in the questionnaire and microhaematuria by reagent strips (alone or with macrohaematuria) revealed good diagnostic performance.
The results indicated that reagent strips are a valid method for detection of microhaematuria for identifying individuals and communities infected with Schistosoma haematobium.

Abstract
[Causes of death in Tunisia: estimates of years of life lost].
This study estimated the number of years of life lost (YLL) by cause due to premature death in Tunisia for the year 2006.
We adopted the methodology (SEYLL) proposed by Murray and Lopez.
The crude rate of YLL was 58.1 per 1000 inhabitants.
The present study highlights the major contribution of noncommunicable diseases to YLL in Tunisia.
The promotion of healthy lifestyle and the reinforcement of secondary prevention in primary health care are the best ways to tackle these diseases.


Abstract
Risk of aggression and criminal behaviour among adolescents living in Alexandria Governorate, Egypt.
Adolescent risk-taking and aggressive behaviours are among the most visible forms of violence in society.
A study was carried out to identify the prevalence and risk factors for aggression, violence and criminal behaviour among adolescents in Alexandria, Egypt.
Using multistage, cluster sampling of families from all health districts in Alexandria, the mothers of 783 adolescents aged 11-19 years answered an Arabic version of the Mentor Research Institute screening questionnaire.
Overall 26.9% of adolescents were assessed to be at high risk and 20.2% at extremely high risk of aggression and criminal behaviour.
Living in urban/slum areas, male sex, low level of parents' education/occupation, exposure to violence within the family and changes in behaviour of any family member were associated with risk of aggression/violence.
In multivariate analysis, the significant independent variables were adolescents' sex, presence of behavioural changes in the family, violence against brothers and sisters and substance abuse by any family member.


Abstract
Detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus directly by loop-mediated isothermal amplification and direct cefoxitin disk diffusion tests.
In parallel, standard microbiological identification and oxacillin susceptibility testing with MecA PCR was performed.
Of 60 blood cultures positive for Gram-positive cocci in clusters, LAMP (via detection of the FemA and MecA genes) showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for identification of MRSA/MSSA.
When coagulase-negative staphylococci were tested, sensitivity for detection of methicillin resistance was 91.7% and specificity was 100%.
LAMP showed higher diagnostic accuracy although DCDD was more cost-effective and did not require additional reagents or supplies.


Abstract
Risk of polio reintroduction to border regions of Islamic Republic of Iran: seroprevalence study of children with at least 5 doses of oral polio vaccine.
Movements of populations from countries where polio has not been eradicated is a concern in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
A cross-sectional, community-based study was implemented in 2010 in 2 districts in Sistan-va-Baluchestan Province near the south-east border.
The aim was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies in children aged 20 (± 2) months who had received at least 5 doses of trivalent oral polio vaccine.
Using cluster sampling, 365 children were enrolled for serological testing.
Antibody titres ≥ 1:10 were considered positive.
Seropositive rates for antibody against poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3 were 94.1%, 96.7% and 78.3% respectively.
The lowest seropositive rate was for antibody against polio serotype 3 (PV3) among boys (58.3%).
Exclusive breastfeeding showed a direct relationship with antibody response to PV3 (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-3.6).
Improving community protection against PV3 is an urgent programme priority.


Abstract
Surveillance of lymphatic filariasis 5 years after stopping mass drug administration in Menoufiya Governorate, Egypt.
The current study aimed to determine the status of lymphatic filariasis 5 years after cessation ofthe mass drug administration in 3 sentinel Egyptian villages in Menoufiya Governorate.
The rapid immunochromatographic card test (ICT) and a new commercial antibody detection kit (CELISA®) were used.
All 1321 primary-school children aged 6-7 years old were ICT negative but 27 children were antibody positive.
All households surveyed in one village with the highest antibody prevalence were ICT negative, indicating an absence of lymphatic filariasis.
The CELISA antibody kit needs more standardization and development to be useful under field conditions.
We conclude that lymphatic filariasis is no longer a public health problem in these villages and other villages with similar epidemiological conditions.


Abstract
Prospects for the sustainability of delivering the Basic Package of Health Services in Afghanistan: a stakeholder analysis.
A stakeholder analysis was applied using qualitative methods.
Fifteen stakeholders were purposively drawn from the Afghanistan ministries of public health and finance, political representatives, development partners, nonprofit organizations and public health experts.
Data were collected through in-depth interviews with the stakeholders and desk review of pertinent documents.
Uneven ownership and divisive positioning are bottlenecks to the evolution of a realistic continuation plan.
Those with the most significant influence are lukewarm, while those who are most supportive have the least influence.
Sustainability needs to be tackled at the start in designing the BPHS rather than in the wake of eventual donor withdrawal.


Abstract
Environmental health data in Bahrain are scarce.
A 5% sample of medical records for those who attended primary health-care centres during 2007 was taken.
Visit rates for all 4 diseases had peaks, in spring and in autumn, with the lowest rates in the summer season when the average temperatures were highest and average humidity was lower.
Respiratory-related visits were highest when the air concentrations of SO2 were highest.
An ongoing surveillance system for climate-sensitive diseases should be initiated to monitor and relate health and environmental trends.

Use of short message service reminders to improve attendance at an internal medicine outpatient clinic in Saudi Arabia: a randomized controlled trial.
Non-attendance at outpatient appointments is a major problem.
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sending short message service (SMS) reminders to patients' mobile phones in reducing non-attendance at scheduled appointments.
A randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2011 in an internal medicine outpatient clinic at a hospital in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia.
Eligible patients (n = 502) were randomly allocated to receive an SMS reminder of their appointment (intervention group) or no reminder (control group).
The non-attendance rate was significantly lower in the reminder group (26.3%) than the non-reminder group (39.8%).
All patients surveyed about their perceptions of the SMS reminder (n = 76) reported they would like to continue to receive SMS reminders in the future.


Abstract
Utilization of a telephone interactive voice-response tobacco cessation support service in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Telephone smoking cessation counselling is a very cost-effective means of reaching dependent smokers in a population.
From a total of 23 979 calls received over a 24-month period, 26.5% of callers hung up without selecting any menus.
The most frequently accessed menu was addresses of smoking cessation support services (23.9%), followed by methods of smoking cessation (14.0%), self-help materials for quitting smoking (11.8%) and nicotine dependence assessment (10.4%).
The average number of contacts decreased dramatically after the first month of the service but there was a significant increase in the 2 months preceding the feast of Ramadan.
Religious messages provide a good opportunity to engage individuals in smoking cessation and may be useful in the planning of media campaigns.


Abstract
Predictors of transition in smoking stages in Iranian adolescents: latent transition analysis.
This study determined the prevalence of smoking stages in adolescents, the probability of transition across stages and the personal and environmental predictors of transition.
A school-based study was conducted in 2010-11 using a random sample of 5197 students (mean age 15.7 years) in Tabriz city.
The students were evaluated twice, 12-months apart.
The latent transition analysis model revealed 9 interpretable statuses for the measurement of smoking stages.
Prevalence data showed that at the first and second assessments 75.1% and 66.8% of students respectively were in the committer stage, while 4.8% and 7.1% respectively were daily smokers.
Over 12 months, 10.1% of the never smokers became experimenters and 1.7% became regular smokers, while 17.0% of experimenters became regular smokers.
The analysis also showed factors associated with transitions in cigarette smoking stages.
Although the prevalence of smoking was low in our adolescents, the rate of becoming a smoker over 1 year was high.


Abstract
[Assessment of the methodological quality of theses submitted to the Faculty of Medicine Fez].
A thesis in medicine is a scientific work which allows a medical student to acquire a Doctor of Medicine degree.
There were 160 theses on various specialties presented in 2008.
The majority of the theses (79.3%) were case series.
Our study shows that there were important deficiencies in the methodological rigor of the theses and very little representation of the theses in publications.


Abstract
Knowledge, attitudes and practices of health-care personnel towards waste disposal management at Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo.
This study assessed knowledge, attitudes and practices of health-care providers towards waste management at Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt.
In this cross-sectional study 110 physicians, 151 nurses and 89 housekeepers were interviewed using a pre-designed questionnaire.
Housekeepers were significantly more knowledgeable than physicians or nurses about hospital policies and systems for waste disposal, but less so about specific details of disposal.
Housekeepers also had the highest overall scores for attitudes to waste disposal among the 3 groups.


Abstract
In view of the widespread use of pesticides in Egypt and the increasing incidence of leukaemia and lymphoma we aimed to assess pesticide exposure and other selected variables as risk factors for lymphoproliferative disorders (leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma).
In a hospital-based, retrospective, case-control study in 2011-2012, adult cases of lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 130) were recruited from outpatient clinics in Menoufia, Egypt, while controls (n = 130) were age- and sex-matched fracture patients.
Family history of cancer, exposure to X-rays, smoking and use of hair dyes were not risk factors for lymphoproliferative disorders in univariate analysis.
History of exposure to pesticides and HCV infection were significant risk factors for lymphoproliferative disorders in multivariate analysis (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.22-4.11 and OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.50-4.80 respectively).
The risk was significant for cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma but not chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.


Abstract
Detection and genotyping of human papillomavirus in breast cancer tissues from Iraqi patients.
Studies have suggested a possible link between breast cancer pathogenesis and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
In the breast cancer group, cocktail HPV genotypes were detected in 60 (46.5%) archived tissue blocks.
Of these, genotypes 16 (55.5%), 18 (58.4%), 31 (65.0%) and 33 (26.6%) were detected.
Mixed HPV genotypes 16 + 18, 16 + 18 + 31, 16 + 18 + 33, 18 + 33, 16 + 31 and 18 + 31 were found in 5.0%, 25.0%, 8.3%, 7.7%, 10.0% and 13.3% of cancer cases respectively.
Only 3 benign breast tumour tissues (12.5%) and none of the healthy breast tissue specimens were HPV-DNA-positive.
The detection of high-oncogenic HPV genotypes in patients with breast cancer supports the hypothesis of an etiologic role for the virus in breast cancer development.


Abstract
Use of human surplus biospecimens in research: a survey from a cancer centre.
Little is known about the public's views on the use of human biospecimens for research in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
A study at a cancer centre in Amman, Jordan, assessed patients' perceptions about the use of blood and tissue samples obtained during clinical care and the use of these in research.
A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 205 adult cancer patients.
Almost all patients (98.0%) accepted the use of their surplus blood samples and archived tissue in research if they consented, with about one-third requesting a specific opt-in consent.
Patients ' views on the potential use of the surplus biospecimens in research were largely concordant with the international literature.


Abstract
Smokeless tobacco consumption in a multi-ethnic community in Pakistan: a cross-sectional study.
Smokeless tobacco is commonly used in south Asia.
In addition to causing oral and pharyngeal cancers, its harmful effects are comparable to smoking tobacco.
A cross-sectional survey with systematic sampling was conducted in 2010-2011 to investigate smokeless tobacco use in a multi-ethnic, semi-urban population in Islamabad, Pakistan (n = 2030).
The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was 16.0% (21.6% among males and 8.8% among females); 51.7% of smokeless tobacco users were also cigarette smokers.
The rate of smokeless tobacco use was comparatively high among Pakhtun males (38.2%) and Sindhi females (22.4%).
The associations between smokeless tobacco use and ethnicity, age group, income level and cigarette smoking were statistically significant among male smokeless tobacco users.
Of the sample 41.4% (840/2030) had inadequate knowledge about the health problems associated with smokeless tobacco.
Appropriate interventions are needed to raise awareness of the health risks and to prevent smokeless tobacco use.


Abstract
Effect of zinc supplementation in children with asthma: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in northern Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are conflicting reports about the benefits of zinc supplements in childhood asthma.
This study examined the effect of zinc supplementation in children with asthma attending an outpatient clinic in Sari, Islamic Republic of Iran.
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial over 8 weeks, 284 children on inhaled steroids were allocated to receive zinc supplements (50 mg/day) (n = 144) or placebo (n = 140).
Cases and controls had low initial serum zinc concentrations [61.8 (SD 7.3) μg/dL and 60.9 (SD 4.3) μg/dL].
After treatment, mean serum zinc level in the case group was significantly higher [129 (SD 20.4) μg/dL] than in the controls [63 (SD 8.6) μg/dL].
There were no significant differences in IgE levels before and after treatment.
The case group showed significant improvements in clinical symptoms such as cough, wheezing and dyspnoea and in all spirometry parameters (FVC, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC).


Abstract
Knowledge and management of fever among Moroccan parents.
Parents often have misperceptions about childhood fever, and little information is available about the home management of feverish children in Morocco.
In this study of the perceptions, knowledge and practices of families regarding children's fever, the parents of 264 febrile children aged 0-16 years were interviewed in a paediatric emergency department in Rabat in 2011.
Most of them (96.8%) considered that fever was a very serious condition, which could lead to side-effects such as brain damage (28.9%), seizures (18.8%) paralysis (19.5%), dyspnoea (14.8%) and coma (14.8%).
Paracetamol was used by 85.9% and traditional treatments by 45.1%.
Knowledge about the correct definition of fever was significantly associated with parents' profession, educational level and receipt of previous information and advice from health professionals.


Abstract
Behaviours and attitudes related to smoking among a Bedouin population in rural Jordan.
ABSTRACT There is limited research about tobacco-related behaviours and attitudes among rural populations in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
The aim of this study was to determine smoking behaviours and attitudes among the nomadic Bedouin in rural southern Jordan.
Patients visiting a village clinic over 2 months of 2009 were invited by the attending physician to participate in the survey, which was adapted from the California Tobacco Survey.
The smoking prevalence among the 92 participants was 46.7%.
Most smokers were men who smoked heavily (> 1 pack/day) (90.7%).
There was general low self-efficacy to quit among smokers, yet 81.4% acknowledged that smoking was harming their health.
Although 79.1% of smokers and 89.1% of non-smokers believed second-hand smoke was harmful to non-smokers, most of them had no restrictions on smoking for residents and guests (66.3%) and most had children at home (73.9%).
These data demonstrate contradictions between attitudes and behaviours about smoking of this rural population.


Abstract
Epidemiology and outcome of childhood asthma: a clinical study in an Egyptian university medical centre.
The prevalence of childhood asthma has increased recently.
The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiology of asthma and risk factors for hospital admission among children attending the outpatient and emergency clinic in a university hospital in Sohag, Egypt.
The prevalence of asthma over a 6-month period among children aged 3-12 years at this hospital was 1.4% (178/12,612).
All the asthmatic children were enrolled in an observational, prospective questionnaire study.
In multivariate regression analysis, significant risk factors for hospital admission were: both cough and dyspnoea as presenting symptoms; using prophylactic therapy; and complaining of continuous symptoms (during both day and night).
Proper use of prophylactic therapies is recommended for better outcomes in our asthmatic children.


Abstract
Oral health behaviours in relation to caries and gingivitis in primary-school children in Tehran, 2008.
The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to determine the prevalence of caries, severe caries and gingivitis in Tehran primary-school children and to analyse the relationship between children's oral hygiene habits and prevalence of these oral health diseases.
Data were collected on the oral hygiene habits of 1271 Tehran schoolchildren (637 boys, 634 girls) aged 9-13 years.
Clinical examinations were performed to determine the decayed, missed and filled teeth (DMFT) and the presence of gingivitis.
Total DMFT > or = 1 was observed in 83.3% of children; 55.5% had tDMFT > or = 4 and 87.7% had > or = 1 site affected by gingivitis.
The source of oral health education had the strongest independent association with severe dental caries (OR= 2.35; 95% CI: 1.80-2.60); dental flossing frequency was the strongest predicting factor correlated with gingivitis (OR = 3.51; CI: 1.46-8.44).


Abstract
Measuring treatment outcome is important for successful tuberculosis (TB) control programmes.
The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of various types of TB cases registered in Pakistan over a 2-year period and compare those outcomes among the different provinces and regions of the country.
A retrospective, cohort study was conducted in which TB treatment outcome reports were reviewed.
Of the 349 694 pulmonary TB cases registered in Pakistan during 2006 and 2007, 309154 (88.4%) were treated successfully.
Treatment success was significantly higher in new smear-positive cases and lower in retreatment cases.
Among the provinces and regions, treatment success was significantly higher in 4 out of 8 provinces.
Treatment success needs to be improved, particularly in retreatment cases.
The national TB control programme should review the provincial and regional programmes and learn lessons from well-performing programmes.
Patient factors that may affect the treatment outcome should be also studied.


Abstract
Interchangeability between paracetamol tablets marketed in Palestine.
Is there a quality reason for a higher price?
The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of 10 commercial paracetamol products available on the Palestinian market.
We carried out a survey on the price of all paracetamol tablet products and assessed their quality.
Although the majority of generic products met the dissolution specification requirement that 80% of the drug must dissolve in 30 minutes, 1 generic product failed.
These results demonstrate that generic paracetamol tablets produced by local manufacturers are often comparable in vitro to the innovator product and have lower costs.


Abstract
Knowledge, attitude and practice of pharmacists and health-care workers regarding oral contraceptives correct usage, side-effects and contraindications.
Despite the success of the Iranian family planning programme, the number of unwanted pregnancies remains high.
Better continuing education for OCP providers and especially for pharmacists seems necessary.


Abstract
Physician satisfaction with hospital clinical laboratory services in Aden Governorate, Yemen, 2009.
To evaluate the level of physicians' satisfaction with hospital clinical laboratory services and related factors in Aden Governorate, we carried out this cross-sectional study during September 2008-September 2009.
Satisfaction with laboratory services of 3 public and 3 private hospitals was assessed.
The overall physician satisfaction was 3.30 out of 5.00.
The highest mean score (3.40) was observed for phlebotomy services, while the lowest mean score (1.95) was for esoteric test turnaround time.
The most important laboratory service category forthe physicians was quality and reliability of the results (54.4%).
An association was observed between physician satisfaction and institution type in 11 categories, with lower satisfaction for public compared to private institutions for all services.
No statistically significant association was observed between physician satisfaction and experience in the field.
Lower satisfaction was observed among those with more than 20 years experience.
Our findings may help to improve the quality of clinical laboratory services.


Abstract
An inventory for assessment of female workers' health promotion behaviour based on the integrated model of planned behaviour and self-efficacy.
This study aimed to develop and assess the psychometric properties of an Inventory for Iranian Female Workers' Health Promotion Assessment (IWAHPA).
In the first phase of the study a content analysis approach was applied to explore the meaning of health promoting behaviours among female workers.
A 120-item questionnaire was developed, based on the integrated model of planned behaviour and self-efficacy.
In the second phase the instruments' psychometric properties were assessed.
Scale level content validity index was 0.93.
Confirmatory factor analysis showed confirmatory factor index 0.97, goodness of fit index 0.95 and root mean square error of approximation 0.05.
Concurrent validity versus the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II showed r = 0.60.
Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.70 to 0.93 across the subscales.
Test-retest reliability revealed no significant differences.
The IWAHPA is a culturally sensitive instrument, with a satisfactory level of validity and reliability, that can be used for planning female workers' health services.


Abstract
Injection practices among practitioners in private medical clinics of Karachi, Pakistan.
The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and determinants of sharps injuries among private health practitioners in slum areas of Karachi, Pakistan.
All practitioners with at least 1 year of experience in a private medical clinic were asked to complete a self-administered, structured questionnaire (317/397 responded).
Only 7.9% of practitioners were qualified from medical school, 12.3% were registered nurses and 8.8% lacked any professional qualifications.
At least 1 sharps injury in the previous 12 months was reported by 26.7%, mostly due to needle recapping.
Only 25.2% reported using a new syringe for each patient.
Better awareness and training on standard precautions is needed for private practitioners in slum areas of Karachi.


Abstract
Use and safety of conducted electronic devices: what is known?
Conductive electronic devices (CED), such as Taser and stun guns, are sold worldwide for use by security services, although they have also been used for self-defence and even for torture.
CED are promoted as non-lethal weapons which can potentially save lives.
However, there are multiple reports of deaths temporally associated with CED use.
These weapons have definite physiological effects in normal volunteers, especially when accompanied by exertion.
Medical examiners often report that deaths followed physical encounters which included the use of CED were due to natural causes, excited delirium and/or drug intoxication.
These cases present complex situations in which multiple factors potentially contribute to the death, including electric shocks which cause neuromuscular incapacitation, severe pain and anxiety.
Public health officials, physicians and hospital personnel need to be aware that individuals controlled with CED are at increased risk of death.
We need better recording of incidents worldwide to understand the extent and outcomes of CED use.


Abstract
Serological pattern of hepatitis B virus among Hbsag negative blood donors in Alexandria, Egypt.
This study in Alexandria, Egypt was conducted to investigate the distribution of different hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers in apparently healthy blood donors who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative, and to determine the major independent risk factors.
Evidence of past exposure to HBV was found in 148/508 screened donors (29.1%).
The most prevalent marker was anti-NBc in 124/508 donors (24.4%), half of whom (63/124) showed anti-HBc only.
Anti-HBs prevalence was 15.9%, combined anti-NBc and antiHBs was 12.0% and anti-HBe was 5.7%.
Independent risk factors associated with the presence of at least 1 markerwere: being married (OR 3.82), history of blood transfusion (OR 3.04) and parenteral antibilharzial treatment (OR 2.49).
The relatively high prevalence of HBV exposure necessitates solid infection control measures and adult vaccination programme awareness.


Abstract
Prevalence of hepatitis B and C virus infections and their related risk factors in Libya: a national seroepidemiological survey.
A high prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) infections has been reported among specific patient groups in Libya; a survey was thus designed to determine the extent of the problem at the national level.
A multi-stage sampling design covering all administrative areas of Libya was applied, covering > 65,000 individuals of all age groups.
All subjects gave a blood sample and completed a questionnaire on demographic and risk behaviour data.
The prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV were 2.2% and 1.3% respectively.
The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with age, rising gradually after age 30 years, in contrast to a stable prevalence of HBsAg in all age groups 10+ years.
Age-adjusted risk factors for HCV infection were previous hospitalization, surgical operations, previous blood transfusions and intravenous drug use; for HBV infection only family exposure or contact with HBV case were identified.


Abstract
Hepatitis E virus seroprevalence in haemodialysis patients in Zanjan Province, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is the most common form of acute hepatitis in adults in endemic regions of Asia.
In a descriptive, cross-sectional study, anti-HEV antibody was measured in patients referred to the 2 haemodialysis centres in Zanjan city, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Among 93 patients with chronic renal failure, mean age 57.0 (SD 18.5) years, antibodies against HEV were positive in 25 (26.9%) patients.
HEV infection was not significantly associated with sex, age, educational level, residence or water source.
The rate of HEV positivity was higher in patients with > 1 than < or = 1 year of haemodialysis (31.3% versus 15.4%) but this was not statistically significant.


Abstract
Experience of malaria in children of a flood affected area: a field hospital study.
ABSTRACT To determine the frequency of malaria among children presenting with fever in a flood affected area, and the frequency of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum among cases, this cross-sectional study was conducted from 1 September 2010 to 15 January 2011 in the Australian Field Camp and Ehsas Field Hospital, Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh District, Southern Punjab, Pakistan.
Each febrile child aged < or = 15 years fulfilling the clinical case definition of suspected uncomplicated malaria was investigated by rapid diagnostic test.
Of 20 288 children examined, 3198 (16%) febrile patients fulfilled the clinical case definition and 2406 (75%) cases were positive for malaria.
P. vivax, P. falciparum, and co-infection were present in 1562 (65%), 759 (31%) and 85(4%) cases respectively.
P. vivax was the most prevalent species followed by P. falciparum.
Twenty seven (4%) cases of P. falciparum fulfilled the case definition of cerebral malaria.
The age group most affected was 5-9 years (41%)


Abstract
Diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathotypes in children with and without diarrhoea in an Iranian referral paediatrics centre.
Diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli can be considered as the most important etiologic agents of diarrhoea in the Islamic Republic of Iran, particularly in children.
This study determined the frequency of diarrhoeagenic E. coli isolates collected from children with acute diarrhoea (n = 50) and a control group (n = 50) at an Iranian referral paediatric centre during a 1-year period.
Using multiplex PCR, diarrhoeagenic E. coli was identified in 90% ofthe case group and 20% of controls.
Enterotoxigenic E coli was the most frequently identified pathotype in both groups (26% in cases; 10% in controls).
Shiga toxin-producing E. coli was the second most isolated pathotype (17%), followed by enteroaggregative E. coli (12%).
No enteroinvasive E. coli and enteropathogenic E. coli strains were recovered.
More than 80% of isolates harboured the fimH gene.
This high proportion of diarrhoeagenic E. coli and diversity of E. coli types highlights the need for enhanced surveillance of gastroenteritis agents in children in this country.


Abstract
Awareness of World Health Organization methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus guidelines at Alexandria University hospitals.
This cross-sectional study aimed to assess knowledge of routes of transmission, awareness of MRSA control guidelines and reasons for non-adherence to guidelines among medical staff at Alexandria University hospitals.
A random sample of 158 physicians and 47 nurses answered a self-administered questionnaire.
Lack of resources was the most common justification for suboptimum adherence.
The study showed low awareness levels of MRSA-related guidelines.


Abstract
Evaluation of a community-based drowning prevention programme in northern Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study evaluated the feasibility of a drowning intervention package in northern Islamic Republic of Iran.
A quasi-experimental design used pre- and post-observations among residents and tourists in water-recreation beach areas of intervention and control regions by the Caspian Sea and in residents near the Caspian Sea coastline.
The fatal drowning rate in the studied resident population in the provinces fell from 4.24 per 100 000 residents at baseline to 3.04 per 100,000 residents at endline.
The risk of death from drowning in the intervention areas in the water-recreation area was greater during the pre-intervention (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.66-2.01) than the implementation period (OR = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15-0.37).
The risk of drowning can be reduced by implementing increased supervision and raising community awareness.


Abstract
Contraceptive use by Iranian women with hypertension, diabetes or obesity.
Women with chronic medical conditions require careful contraceptive management.
The aim of this cross-sectional study in Tehran was to determine the pattern of contraception use by women with diabetes, hypertension or obesity.
A sample of 264 women aged 18-53 years old was recruited; 81 (30.7%) had diabetes type 2,100 (37.9%) were obese/overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and 83 (31.5%) had hypertension.
Across all 3 groups, the rate of use of contraceptive methods was significantly different before and after diagnosis.
Before diagnosis of disease the most common method was hormonal contraception in all women (55.0%, 71.6% and 78.3% of diabetic, overweight and hypertensive women respectively), whereas after diagnosis coital withdrawal was the most common method in diabetic and obese/overweight women (41.2% and 28.0% respectively) and almost the most common method for hypertensive women (35.4%).


Abstract
Knowledge of diabetes among type 2 diabetes patients attending a primary health care clinic in Sri Lanka.
Patients ' knowledge about their illness is considered important in controlling diabetes and preventing complications.
A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted among patients attending the diabetes clinic of a primary care level hospital in Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.
During a 1-month period in 2009 all consenting patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who had been attending the clinic for more than 3 months were included in the study.
Using an interviewer administered, structured questionnaire 150 patients (135 females, 15 males) answered 25 questions about diabetes knowledge (scored x4 to give score range 0-100).
A majority of patients (70.0%) had a good score (> 65) on the knowledge test but critical gaps in knowledge were revealed, especially regarding knowledge about symptoms of poor control and importance of regular follow-up.
Although patients with longer duration of diabetes had higher mean knowledge scores, they also had higher fasting blood glucose levels.
Education programmes are needed to address critical gaps in patients' knowledge.


Abstract
[Prevalence of overweight and obesity in schoolchildren in Tebessa (eastern Algeria) between 1995 and 2007].
This study assessed the prevalence of overweight and obesity among public-school children aged 4 to 13 years in Tebessa, eastern Algeria over 10/12 years.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity in 2005/2007 was 8.49%, down from 17.39% in 1995/1998.
Overweight decreased from 12.55% to 6.38% (P = 0.0001) and obesity from 4.48% to 1.80% (P = 0.0001) over the same time period.
Children aged 10 to 13 years were the only ones who showed changes during this period.


Abstract
Dietary behaviours and dental fluorosis among Gaza Strip children.
A high prevalence of dental fluorosis has been identified among children in the Gaza Strip.
This study aimed to determine the history of breastfeeding and dietary behaviours among children in the Gaza Strip and to examine potential associations with the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis.
A cross-sectional study recruited a stratified cluster random sample of 350 children aged 12-18 years and their mothers.
Data about dietary behaviours in the first 7 years of life were collected by interview questionnaire.
Dental fluorosis was determined using the Thyllstrup-Fejerskov index.
A majority of children were breastfed exclusively in the first 6 months (82.9%) but 98.1% were given tea in the first year of life.
The prevalence of dental fluorosis was 78.0%.
Both intake of animal proteins and plant proteins were negatively associated with the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis.
Further studies to investigate fluoride intake is required to plan preventive interventions.


Abstract
Saudi Arabian expatriate worker fitness-screening programme: a review of 14 years of data.
Expatriate workers must be medically examined in their country of origin at accredited centres prior to their arrival in any Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country and are reexamined when they enter the country.
This review investigated the epidemiological profile of registered expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia who were found medically unfit to work.
A descriptive analysis was performed on 4,272,480 records of a Ministry of Health database from 1997 to 2010.
The greatest proportion of workers was from Indonesia (34.3%).
The total proportion of unfit expatriate workers was low (0.71%).
The highest rate of unfitness was among workers from Ethiopia (4.06%), followed by Somalia (2.41%).
Hepatitis B infection was the most common cause (57.5%), followed by noncommunicable diseases (21.2%) and hepatitis C infection (17.4%).
This review suggests that the total number of workers registered in the Saudi Ministry of Health was underestimated, and the rate of unfit workers was lower than for other GCC countries, suggesting that standards and quality assurance in Saudi laboratories require revision.


Abstract
Study of operated primary and secondary (recurrence) hydatidosis in hospitals of Kermanshah, west of Islamic Republic of Iran.
Cystic echinococcosis, caused by the larval stage of Echinoccocus granulosus, is a global public health threat.
The aim of this study was to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cases of primary and secondary hydatid cyst in the west of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
A retrospective record review was made in 7 public and private hospitals in Kermanshah from 2004 to 2009.
Of 526 files of suspected cases analysed, 291 cases of hydatid cyst had been operated upon and confirmed.
Of the patients, 51.5% were females, 57.7% lived in urban and suburban areas and the largest age group (17.5%) was 31-40 years.
The major organs involved were liver (64.9%) and lung (26.8%) and 18 cases (6.2%) were confirmed as secondary hydatidosis.
Most patients (79.4%) had been treated with albendazole.
Kermanshah province should be considered an endemic region for human hydatid cyst disease; greater efforts in prevention are needed.


Abstract
Study of host immunity in patients with Helicobacter pylori-related idiopathic thrombocytopenia.
To test the role of T helper cell Th1 immunity we recruited 24 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia associated with H. pylori seropositivity.
They were divided into 2 groups: 12 with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (Group 1) and 12 with non-immune mediated thrombocytopenia (Group 2).
We also recruited 10 individuals seronegative for H. pylori (Group 3) as controls.
Initial platelet count was significantly lower in Group 1 than Group 2.
H. pylori was eradicated in 10 of 12 patients in Group 1 and in all patients in Group 2.
Transient improvement (< 3 months) in the platelet count occurred in only 2 patients in Group 1 while improvement for > 6 months was observed in all patients in Group 2.
There was a statistically significant direct correlation between platelet count and levels of TNF- and IFN-gamma in both study groups, while a non-significant correlation was seen in Group 3.
Thus, H. pylori infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cases of thrombocytopenia, and should be eradicated in all H. pylori-positive patients with thrombocytopenia.


Abstract
Factors associated with treatment default by tuberculosis patients in Fez, Morocco.
Interruption in tuberculosis (TB) treatment still remains the most important challenge for control of the disease.
This study aimed to identify the determinants of TB treatment default in Fez, Morocco.
A 1:2 pair-matched case-control study was carried out in the TB control units in Fez.
Of the 320 patients (108 defaulters, 212 controls), 80.6% were male.
The main reason for defaulting reported by patients was the sensation of being cured.
The rate of defaulting in Fez can be lowered through targeted and realistic measures.


Abstract
High tuberculosis treatment success in Kabul, Afghanistan despite high patient transfers out.
The National Tuberculosis (TB) Institute has the highest patient transfer-out rate in Afghanistan, but the result and treatment outcome of transferred patients were unknown in 2009.
This operational research investigated the characteristics and treatment outcome of all transferred-out patients living in Kabul province.
We analysed the 1-year TB register of the Institute (n = 1180 cases) and visited 24 health centres to review their TB registers.
The results show the transfer-out rate was 52.6%.
Of the transferred cases, 58.6% were women and 61.8% pulmonary TB cases (smear-positive 70.6%).
The arrival rates of transfer-out patients at health centres in Kabul province were 87.6% for both men and women.
Males aged 21-40 years were the most likely to be nonarrivals (OR = 8.91; 95% CI: 1.55-66.7).
Treatment success rates in female and male patients were 84.4% and 77.5% respectively and default rates were 7.8% and 18.3%.
Strategies to reduce the non-arrival to health centres and treatment interruption in male patients aged 20-40 years are warranted.

This survey indicated that the Afghanistan national TB programme needs to develop plans to improve the quality of diagnosis, suspect management and contact management in paediatric TB cases.


Abstract
Tobacco use among Iranian dental students: a national survey.
A national survey was conducted to provide up-to-date data on current and ever use of tobacco among Iranian dental students.
All 4th-year students of 8 randomly selected dental schools were surveyed anonymously in December 2010 using the Global Health Professions Student Survey questionnaire.
Of 325 participants, 54.2% were ever users of tobacco products (73.0% of males versus 44.4% of females); 50.8% had used waterpipes, 34.2% cigarettes and 9.3% other products.
The most common age at first use was 20-24 years for both sexes.
Current tobacco use was reported by 20.6% of respondents, cigarette smoking by 10.8% and waterpipe smoking by 15.8%.
Regression models showed that current cigarette and waterpipe smoking were significantly associated with male sex but not with type of dental school (state/private).
Current waterpipe smoking was also associated with age at first experience.
In view of the important role of dentists in tobacco control, the prevention of tobacco use should be stressed among Iranian dental students.


Abstract
Oral health status of male adolescent smokeless tobacco users in Saudi Arabia.
Few studies have evaluated the oral effects of smokeless tobacco use in adolescents.
This study described the oral health status of adolescents who were daily users of local smokeless tobacco (shamma) in Saudi Arabia.
A convenience sample of 270 middle-school male students completed a questionnaire and received an oral examination and a saliva cotinine test.
Among the students, 96% had plaque deposits (mean plaque index score 1.66); 41% had gingivitis (mean clinical attachment loss 1.1 mm); 56% had dental caries (mean decayed, missing, filled teeth score 2.1) and 86% had at least I mucosal lesion.
The levels of plaque, gingivitis, dental caries and periodontitis among smokeless tobacco users were similar to those of most adolescents regardless of tobacco use.
Strong measures should be taken to increase students' awareness of the adverse health effects of tobacco use and to control their access to tobacco.


Abstract
Trends in cardiovascular disease risk factors in children and adolescents: Tehran lipid and glucose study.
Data on trends are important in order to identify if there is a problem.
The participants were categorized into age groups 3-6, 7-12 and 13-17 years.
Body mass index measurements were taken and blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides measured.
Overall the prevalence of obesity in Tehran children and adolescents increased significantly from 2000 to 2006 while blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations decreased.
The causes for the decreased blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations should be evaluated.
The increased prevalence of obesity in Tehran children and adolescents is of concern and requires monitoring.


Abstract
Relation between serum ferritin and liver and heart MRI T2* in beta thalassaemia major patients.
There is a need for higly accurate non-invasive methods for assessing organ iron content in thalassaemia patients.
Data were obtained from the medical records of 156 thalassemia major patients in Tehran.
There was a moderate negative correlation between serum ferritin and liver MRI T2* relaxation time (r = -0.535) and a weak negative correlation between serum ferritin and heart MRI T2* relaxation time (r = -0.361).
Hepatitis C infection and liver enzyme levels did not confound or modify the relation between ferritin and liver or heart MRI T2*.
Liver and heart MRI T2* readings were poorly correlated (r = 0.281).
Routine evaluation of liver and heart iron content using MRI T2* is suggested to better evaluate the haemosiderosis status in thalassemia patients.


Abstract
Impact of the mandatory age-based single-embryo transfer legislation in Turkey on outcome of in vitro fertilization: a multicentre study.
SET, FT-FT and double-embryo transfer were used in 5632 patients after legislation, while traditional IVF and FT-FT approach was used in 6029 patients before legislation.
The cumulative pregnancy rate after legislation was slightly lower (38.2%) than before legislation (42.0%) but not significantly so.
The single pregnancy rate for SET and traditional IVF were similar between the 2 groups (37.8% versus 28.7%), while multiple pregnancy rates were significantly higher before than after legislation (13.7% versus 0.3%).
For FT-ET, the number of cycles was significantly higher after legislation (862 versus 616).
SET yielded similar results to traditional IVF.
In order to reduce multiple pregnancies without significantly decreasing pregnancy rates, SET might be a successful strategy.


Abstract
Tuberculosis and migration: a review.
Routine immigration medical screening, either before or after arrival in the recipient country, is designed to avoid the admission of migrants who pose a public health threat.
Screening measures, however, have changed with time largely based on respect for individuals' rights.
This paper reviews the measures that are being used by countries to screen immigrants and improve their health well-being, and presents cases studies from two Eastern Mediterranean Region countries.


Abstract
Prevalence of tobacco use among adult and adolescent females in Egypt.
Both surveys employed cluster sampling to produce nationally representative samples and used standard core questionnaires with optional, country-specific questions.
The results indicated that a higher percentage of adolescent girls in Egypt used tobacco than did adult females.
Overall, 3.8% of girls aged 13-15 years used some form of tobacco compared with 0.6% of women aged 15+ years.
Adolescents were over 14 times more likely than adult women to currently smoke cigarettes and 11 times more likely to smoke waterpipes.
Moreover, the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescent girls had increased from 1.4% in the 2005 GYTS to 2.8% in 2009, indicating that social and cultural norms may be changing.

Abstract
Retinoids play an important role in lung development and immune response.
The effects of retinoids are mediated through 2 families of retinoid receptors: retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), with alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) subtypes in each family.


Abstract
The purpose of the study was to compare the conductance and mannitol permeability of canine colonic mucosa in response to carprofen or 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) with or without tempol pretreatment.
Ten colonic mucosa sections per dog were mounted in Ussing chambers.
Treatments were done in duplicate.
Mucosa was exposed to carprofen (200 μg/mL) or DNP (0.25 mM), both with and without tempol (1 mM) pretreatment.
Conductance was calculated every 15 min for 240 min.
Mannitol flux was calculated over 3 consecutive 60-minute periods.
Histology or electron microscopy was done after exposure.
Conductance over time, mannitol flux, frequency of histologic categories, and electron microscopic changes were analyzed for treatment effects.
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) conductance over time for carprofen or DNP-treated colons was not significantly different from control regardless of tempol pretreatment.
Period 3 mannitol fluxes for carprofen and DNP-treated colon were not significantly different, but were greater than control.
Period 3 mannitol flux for tempol + carprofen was significantly less than tempol + DNP-treated colon.
Sloughing of cells and erosions were seen in the mucosa of carprofen-treated colon.
Mitochondrial damage was seen more often in carprofen-treated than DNP-treated or control colon.
Treatment with carprofen or DNP increased the mannitol flux, but pretreatment with tempol mitigated the carprofen effect.
It is apparent that structural mitochondrial damage occurs in the canine colonic mucosa after carprofen and DNP exposure.


Abstract
The effects of heparin administration, by the oral route, were evaluated in dogs.
In single and multiple dose studies (single 7.5 mg/kg, multiple 3 × 7.5 mg/kg per 48 h), plasma, urine, and fecal samples were collected at various times up to 120 h after oral administration of unfractionated heparin.
Changes in plasma and urine anti-Xa activity, plasma and urine anti-IIa activity, plasma activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and antithrombin (ATIII), and chemical heparin in urine and feces were examined with time.
No clinical evidence of bleeding was detected in any dog during the studies.
Oral heparin therapy may be applicable for thromboembolic disease in animals.
Further studies are warranted to determine the effects of oral heparin at the endothelial level in the dog.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine if prior measurement of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane influences the effect of ketamine on the MAC of isoflurane in dogs.
Eight mixed-breed dogs were studied on 2 occasions.
Anesthesia was induced and maintained using isoflurane.
In group 1 the effect of ketamine on isoflurane MAC was determined after initially finding the baseline isoflurane MAC.
In group 2, the effect of ketamine on isoflurane MAC was determined without previous measure of the baseline isoflurane MAC.


Abstract
Inflammatory airway disease (IAD) is very common in stabled horses.
Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) drugs are often used to relieve clinical signs, although long-term exposure to these drugs may result in rebound bronchoconstriction.
The purpose of this study was twofold: i) to describe the deposition of radiolabeled drugs using a novel one-nostril design mask-spacer combination with a breath-activated inhaler (BAI), and ii) to determine whether treatment for 10 d with inhaled albuterol using this device would impair the ability of albuterol to prevent bronchospasm during a histamine challenge test.
The percentage of radio-aerosol deposited in the total lung was 12.39% ± 5.05%.
All study horses demonstrated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) before enrollment in the study [mean provocative concentration eliciting 35% increase in delta flow (PC35) < 6 mg/mL histamine].
There was no significant difference in airway hyperresponsiveness to post-albuterol histamine challenge before or after treatment with albuterol.
A 10-d treatment with placebo, however, caused a significant increase in airway hyperresponsiveness in all horses (P < 0.001).


Abstract
The purpose of this study was to manually measure corneal thickness in canine eyes using a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) device and to assess intra- and inter-observer reliability of this technique.
Twenty healthy dogs with a mean age of 4.7 y were examined.
A 6-mm corneal pachymetry protocol was carried out by 1 operator using 1 SD-OCT device in both eyes of each animal.
Measurements were obtained manually and in duplicate by 2 independent investigators (> 24 h apart), using the built-in caliper function.
Measurements included epithelial thickness (ET), non-epithelial thickness (NET), and central corneal thickness (CCT).
The overall mean ET, NET, and CCT for all eyes examined were 72.3 ± 4.6 μm, 538.9 ± 42.5 μm, and 611.2 ± 40.3 μm, respectively.
There was no significant difference in ET, NET, or CCT based on the eye examined [oculus dexter (OD) versus oculus sinister (OS)], age, or gender of the animal.
There was no significant difference in replicate measurements of ET, NET, or CCT done by the same operator, although a small but significant difference was noted between operators for ET measurements only.


Abstract
Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a transmissible lung cancer caused by Jaggsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV).
It is difficult to identify animals infected with JSRV but are clinically healthy.
The virus does not induce a specific antibody response and, although proviral DNA sequences of JSRV can be found in mononuclear blood cells, the detection is inconsistent.
The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of JSRV in the bone marrow of infected sheep and develop a more consistent screening method.
Immunohistochemical examination of bone marrow samples from 8 asymptomatic JSRV-infected sheep revealed the presence of positively labelled cells.
However, JSRV could not be detected by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in bone marrow aspirates periodically collected from these animals.
Results suggest that JSRV-infected cells may be present in the bone marrow of symptomless animals, but the number is below the detectable level for PCR.


Abstract
For people unaccustomed to high altitude, exposure to height often leads to Acute Mountain Sickness, with headaches, difficulty breathing and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Nausea and loss of appetite may result in less calorie intake and weight loss.
At altitudes greater than 4000 m about 50-80% of people are affected.
After only short exposure, gastrointestinal mucosal lesions can occur, potentially leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and lessened hunger.

Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus species isolated from Lebanese dairy-based products.
The highest levels of contamination with staphylococci were in baladi cheese.
Resistance rates ranged from 67% to gentamicin to 94% to oxacillin and clindamycin.
The results suggest that these locally made dairy-based foods may act as vehicles for the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus spp.


Abstract
Fluoroquinolone and macrolide co-resistance in clinical isolates of Campylobacter species: a 15-year study in Karachi, Pakistan.
Fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics are generally considered as first-line drugs for the treatment of severe campylobacteriosis.
This study was conducted to analyse the trend of erythromycin and ofloxacin resistance among Campylobacter spp. isolated from stool specimens over a period of 15 years (1992-2007) at The Aga Khan University clinical laboratory in Karachi, Pakistan.
A total of 83 396 stool specimens were processed, with a 14% isolation rate for enteric pathogens.
The isolation rate of Campylobacter spp. was low during 1992-93 (6%-13%), peaked in 1996 (46%), then ranged from 20% to 40%.
We report a rising trend in ofloxacin resistance, re-emergence of erythromycin resistance and indications of co-resistance to both drugs in clinical isolates of Campylobacter spp.


Abstract

Abstract
Evaluation of capillary blood glucose versus a high-risk questionnaire for screening for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in Eastern province, Saudi Arabia.
Of 15 082 individuals screened, 65.8% were positive by the American Diabetes Association risk-score questionnaire and 71.3% by determination of capillary blood glucose (CBG) using a portable glucometer.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus was confirmed in 20.3% of participants and pre-diabetes in 33.9% using fasting venous blood testing.
The risk-score questionnaire did not perform well versus fasting and random CBG.
Optimal cut-offs for fasting and random CBG were 120 mg/dL and 160 mg/dL respectively.
Fasting CBG had higher sensitivity, specificity and discriminating ability than random CBG for detection of diabetes and pre-diabetes in this population.


Abstract
Prevalence of malocclusions in school-age children attending the orthodontics department of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.
To provide quantitative data about the prevalence of malocclusions in the Shiraz orthodontic population, we studied the records of 700 patients (391 girls and 309 boys) aged 6-14 years attending the undergraduate Department of Orthodontics at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.
The prevalence of Angle class I, II and III malocclusion of first molars was 52.0%, 32.6% and 12.3% respectively.
Skeletal class I, II and III malocclusion was found in 18.0%, 70.0% and 12.0% respectively.
There were no significant differences between the sexes in the prevalence of different types of skeletal malocclusion.
Orthodontics students need more education and training in the management of class II malocclusion to improve the overall quality of care for patients.

Abstract
Difficulties facing first-year medical students at Umm Alqura University in Saudi Arabia.
This study investigated medical students' study habits and perceptions of learning difficulties during their first year of study.
A specially-designed questionnaire was answered by 165 second-year medical and medical science students at Umm Alqura University in Saudi Arabia.
Male students ranked peer competition as the top difficulty whereas females ranked it fourth.
A majority of students were dissatisfied with the passive, lecture-based method of teaching and wanted the English language curriculum to be improved by more emphasis on conversation skills.
Early introduction of the concept of active learning and effective studying habits is needed.


Abstract
Level of physical activity among teaching and support staff in the education sector in Dohuk, Iraq.
Sedentary lifestyle is a major underlying cause of death, disease, and disability worldwide.
The short form of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to estimate physical activity.
Using the higher IPAQ cutoff point (i.e. high, not moderate, level of activity) the prevalence of physical activity beneficial to health among all participants was 39.5%.
Small but nonsignificant differences in physical activity were found among sex, age and BMI categories.
Teachers reported significantly higher physical activity levels than support staff, and individuals with longer average sitting times per day reported significantly lower levels of physical activity.

Abstract
Report summary.
Seniors' Falls in Canada: Second Report: key highlights.
Injury in Canada is a serious public health concern.
Injuries are a leading cause of hospitalization for children, young adults and seniors and a major cause of disability and death.
Falls remain the leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations among Canadian seniors, and data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging indicate that 20% of seniors living in the community reported a fall in the previous year, with a higher prevalence among older seniors, i.e., those aged over 80 years.
Falls and associated outcomes not only harm the injured individuals but also affect their families, friends and care providers; they also place considerable pressure on the health care system.
However, we do know that these personal and economic costs can be avoided through injury prevention activities.
The Seniors' Falls in Canada: Second Report provides policy makers, researchers, community programmers and practitioners with current data and trends on falls, injuries and hospitalizations among Canadian adults aged 65 years and over.
This report is intended for use in public health research, policy development and practice.

Abstract
Problem
s of management of medical solid waste at primary health care centres in the Palestinian Territory and their remedial measures.
This study was conducted to investigate the management aspects of medical solid waste (MSW) at primary health care centres in Nablus and Salfit governorates in the West Bank, Palestine.
We interviewed 190 health care staff from primary health care centres in this area.
The most frequent type of waste produced was sharps waste: only 5.3% of respondents said this was never produced.
Infectious waste was the second most frequent type produced.
Only 40.4% of the respondents stated that hazardous MSW was always treated.
Over 80% said that non-sharps MSW was separated into its different components, but almost 20% said that sharps were not placed in special containers.
We recorded a mean of 34 g of hazardous solid waste and 55 g of non-hazardous solid waste generated per outpatient per day.
Staff awareness and training, separation of MSW, establishment of simple treatment facilities are the major measures suggested for improvement of the waste management practices.


Abstract
Prime costs of clinical laboratory services in Tehran Valiasr Hospital in 2009.
Prime cost determinations can increase managerial effectiveness in budget allocation and strategic planning.
This study was designed to calculate the prime cost of clinical laboratory services in Tehran Valiasr Hospital using the activity-based costing (ABC) model.
The highest costs were for human recourses (44%) and the lowest for energy (5%).
The largest proportion of activities (97%) was by specialists, reflecting the importance of human recourses in prime costs.
The highest prime cost was for urinalysis (11% of tests) and the lowest for sodium determination (21% of tests), which demonstrates that prime cost decreases as service frequency increases.
The average estimated prime cost was 63% higher than the fees established by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
The results show that the Tehran Valiasr Hospital laboratory faces a budgetary deficit.
The prime cost of services can be reduced by improving human recourse management and standardization of resource consumption.


Abstract
Postmarketing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence of generic and brand atenolol in Egypt.
Concerns have been raised regarding the postmarketing quality of generic drugs.
This study assessed the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence of generic and brand atenolol tablets in 24 healthy male volunteers in a single-dose, open, randomized, two-period crossover study under fasting conditions.
Blood samples were collected for 24 h post dosing and assayed for atenolol using HPLC.
The mean plasma concentration-time curves for both products were similar.
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis indicated bioequivalence based on the mean ratios of log-transformed Cmax and AUC values.
Both products were well tolerated.
Both atenolol products were bioequivalent in the postmarketing setting and can be used interchangeably in clinical practice.

The mean scores of respondents' knowledge and attitudes were 12.7 (SD 2.9) and 48 (SD 6.1) respectively.
We conducted the study to use the findings to incorporate geriatric dental care programmes into dental school curricula in the Islamic Republic of Iran.


Abstract
Classification of bifid mandibular canals in the Syrian population using panoramic radiographs.
The objective of this study was to classify the different routes of the bifid mandibular canals (BMCs) on 2400 panoramic radiographs in a Syrian population.
BMCs were identified, drawn and classified according to the classification of Langlais et al.
BMCs were found in 41 cases (0.98%).
A total of 15 canals (36.6%) were classified as Class I, 6 canals (14.6%) as Class II, 8 canals as Class III (19.5%) and 12 canals (29.3%) as Class IV.
There was no statistically significant association between BMC class and sex or affected jaw side prevalence.
The clinical implications of BMC classes are discussed and an algorithm is suggested as a clinical guide for clinicians.

Recombinant activated factor VII as treatment for intractable haemorrhage.
The objective of this study was to determine the outcome of patients treated with recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) to promote haemostasis in intractable bleeding associated with trauma injury or other causes.
The medical records of 44 consecutive patients treated with rFVIIa were retrospectively reviewed for blood product use before and after treatment.
The early use of rFVIIa was associated with decreased 50-day mortality in patients with severe trauma requiring massive transfusion, but was not associated with increased risk of severe thrombotic events.


Abstract
Shoulder adhesive capsulitis prevalence among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic: a case-control study.
Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for shoulder adhesive capsulitis which causes disability and affects quality of life.
The sample was drawn from in- and outpatients at Al-Mouassat and Al-Assad university hospitals during November 2009-2010.
Of the patients with the condition, those with diabetes were younger than those without diabetes.
Shoulder adhesive capsulitis in the diabetes group was associated with diabetes duration and poor diabetes control (P < 0.05).


Abstract
Medical management of abdominal hydatid cyst in a teaching hospital in Eastern Libya: treatment and outcome in 16 cases, 2004-2010.
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for hydatid cyst, but the development of antihelminths has become a boon in the management of the disease.
The role of medical management is now well defined, alone or with surgery or percutaneous aspiration, injection and re-aspiration (PAIR).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of antihelminth treatment on 16 selected patients (10 females and 6 males) with hydatid cyst.
Patients were followed up for 12 months after completion of therapy.
Hydatid cyst collapsed completely in 10 patients; recurrence of cyst during the observation period was recorded in 2 patients.
No patient in this study developed side-effects from the treatment.


Abstract
Nelaton catheter assisted versus standard nasogastric tube insertion: a randomized, clinical trial.
It is sometimes difficult to insert a nasogastric tube in an anaesthetized patient.
Eighty patients (40 in each group) were included in this study.
The success rate of nasogastric tube insertion was 90% in the Nelaton group and 57% in the control group (P = 0.001).
The mean insertion time was 80 (SD 43) and 92 (SD 35) seconds in the Nelaton and the control groups respectively.


Abstract
Arterial pulsatility as an index of cerebral microangiopathy in diabetes type 2.
Transcranial doppler is an inexpensive, non-invasive investigation.
This study assessed its validity in determining cerebral small vessel disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Flow velocity and pulsatility index were measured in the middle cerebral, basilar and intracranial internal carotid arteries of a sample of 141 diabetic patients with no other risk factors, and 132 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
The patients were divided into 2 groups: 73 with complicated and 68 with uncomplicated diabetes.
There was a statistically significant difference between the complicated diabetes and control groups for the 3 arteries and most indices.
The differences between the uncomplicated diabetes patients and the controls were also statistically significant but less strongly.
Transcranial doppler may be useful in early diagnosis of cerebral small vessel disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.


Abstract
Domestic violence and consanguineous marriages - perspective from Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
Domestic violence is globally endemic and adversely impacts the health and economic well-being of women and society.
This study used the standardized and validated assessment instrument "Woman Abuse Screening Tool" to study the prevalence of various forms of domestic violence among married women.
The relationship between domestic violence and consanguineous marriage was studied using the chi-squared test.
Cumulatively, 1010 married women were interviewed.
Emotional abuse was the most commonly reported abuse, reported by 721 (71.4%) women as either often or sometimes, followed by sexual abuse and physical abuse, reported by 527 (52.2%) and 511 (50.6%) respectively.
There is a need for better understanding of the magnitude and scale of domestic violence in Pakistan by using standardized assessment tools for meaningful comparisons across different parts of the country over time.


Abstract
Gestational choriocarcinoma at Ibn Rochd Hospital, Casablanca, 2004-2010.
The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the frequency, risk factors, management and prognosis of gestational choriocarcinoma at the gynaecology-obstetrics C department of the Ibn Rochd Hospital in Casablanca, Morocco over a 7-year period (2004-2010).
There were 18 760 pregnancies in the study period, among which 8 cases of gestational choriocarcinoma were recorded, a frequency of 43/100 000 or 1 case of gestational choriocarcinoma in 2345 pregnancies.
Maternal age ranged from 20 to 48 years.
All the patients presented with bleeding.
Metastases were found in 3 patients, including 2 with pulmonary localization.
Of the 8 cases, 2 patients died and 6 had complete remission.


Abstract
Spatial distribution of health facilities in Islamabad, Pakistan.
There are no comprehensive, spatially referenced databases of public and private health facilities in any of the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Cumulatively, 166 (77.6% of all clinics mapped) were in close proximity (within 1 km) to a hospital.
Repeating such studies elsewhere would help us to better understand different spatial distribution patterns, the reasons for them and the implications for health-care planning.


Abstract
Dual addictions, parallel treatments: nicotine replacement therapy for patients receiving methadone treatment in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
A total of 424 men entered the study at 4 drug treatment centres in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.
The intervention group received a 6-week regimen of nicotine replacement pharmacotherapy at no charge.
After 6 months, 211 persons (99.5%) in the control group continued to smoke and 1 person (0.5%) had quit.
The findings suggest that the use of nicotine replacement pharmacology in tandem with methadone maintenance treatment can lead to dramatically improved efficacy for treatment of dual addictions.


Abstract
Smoking among dental students in Monastir, Tunisia.
Dental students can help in the fight against smoking.
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of smoking and assess behaviours, knowledge and attitudes among dental students in Monastir, Tunisia.
A survey using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted during November 2008.
The sample consisted of 1123 dentistry students aged 18 to 28 years.
About 14% of the students were smokers (38.4% of boys and 3.4% girls, P < 0.0001) with an average of 16 cigarettes smoked daily.
The age at smoking first cigarette ranged from 8 to 21 years (mean 16, SD 2.3 years).
Among the smoker students, 66.5% of their fathers and 3% of their mothers were also smokers.
Over 80% of these students were aware that smoking is harmful to health.
These results reveal a need to include classes on smoking cessation in the dental curriculum.

Abstract
Pattern of head and neck cancers in a sample of Syrian population: a retrospective hospital-based study.
Head and neck cancers include a wide number of different types of cancer arising from a variety of different sites in the head and neck.
Cancer patterns show a large worldwide variation.
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pattern of occurrence of head and neck cancers in a sample of the Syrian population.
A retrospective hospital-based descriptive study was conducted of all cases of head and neck cancer at two hospitals in Damascus over a 3-year period (2008-2010).
Information was obtained from the records of the 2 centres: Maxillofacial Hospital and the head and neck surgery department in Al Mouasah Hospital.
A total of 267 cases of head and neck cancers were recorded.
The male to female ratio was 4:1 and the mean age was 57.7 years.
The 5 most common sites were larynx (45.0%), oral cavity (16.5%), skin of the head and neck (14.0%), lower lip (6.0%) and lymph nodes (5%).
Nose and external auditory tube were the least common sites.
Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histological type (69%).
This study indicates the relative prominence of laryngeal, oral and skin cancers in this area.


Abstract
Vitamin D status of type 2 diabetic patients compared with healthy subjects in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
An inverse relationship has been shown between vitamin D deficiency and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
In this cross-sectional study in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, a country with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, we determined the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among 90 type 2 DM patients and 90 healthy subjects.
The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in men with type 2 DM and healthy men were 42.7% and 22.2% respectively.
None of the differences between the 2 groups was statistically significant.


Abstract
Its incidence in the Islamic Republic of Iran is 5%-12%.
Women were divided into high and low exposure groups according to the mean density of exposure to pollutants during pregnancy.
There was no statistically significant relationship between exposure to air pollutants including CO, particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and O3 and pre-eclampsia.
The combined effect was also not significant.
Air pollution is one of the problems of modern society and its avoidance is almost impossible for pregnant women.
This study should reduce concern about pregnant women living in polluted cities.


Abstract
The trend of caesarean delivery in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has witnessed a sharp increase in the number of caesarean sections in the past two decades.
The study shows that there is a very wide range of prevalence of caesarean section rates in the country.
This would indicate that most caesarean sections in our country are not medically indicated, although perhaps in some areas there are not enough caesarean sections.


Abstract
Toxoplasma seroepidemiology in women who intend to marry in Jahrom, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Infection with Toxoplasma gondii during pregnancy can lead to severe fetal sequelae.
This cross-sectional study aimed to determine T. gondii seropositivity among a sample of young women in Jahrom, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Four hundred and three young women with a mean age of 20.3 years who presented for pre-marriage laboratory testing were entered in the study.
T. gondii antibodies (IgG and IgM) were measured using ELISA.
Of the 403 women, 15% were seropositive for T. gondii antibodies (13% for IgG and 2% for IgM).
Seropositivity for T. gondii IgG differed according to age groups but there was no significant difference (P = 0.83).
IgM seropositivity showed the highest rate among women aged < 20 years.


Abstract
Prevalence of congenital eye anomalies in a paediatric clinic in Ghana.
There is little information about the epidemiology of congenital eye anomalies in Ghana.
Visual acuity was quantitatively assessed in 209 patients and 130 had some visual impairment; 49 with bilateral and 64 with unilateral blindness.
The most frequent congenital anomaly overall was cataract (n = 44).
In infants, cataract was the most frequent finding (28/121).
Toddlers most frequently presented with retinoblastoma (10/65).
Glaucoma was the most frequent anomaly in preschool (9/39) and school (10/38) children.
We conclude that avoidable causes of childhood blindness caused most congenital eye anomalies.
Intensification of community-based health promotion and preventive eye care, early detection and provision of adequate resources for effective therapy could reverse these trends.


Abstract
Epidemiological profile of individuals with American cutaneous leishmaniasis in Jequitinhonha Valley, Brazil.
This study aimed to characterize the epidemiological profile of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in 34 municipalities in Jequitinhonha Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil, registered from 2005 to 2010 with the Regional Health Superintendence, using data from the Brazilian Disease Notification Information System.
Among 281 cases, 156 (55.5%) were included in the study.
A statistically significant difference was found in ACL among men between 21 and 60 years of age (P = 0.034) in relation to women and other age groups.
Analysing the male sample, a significant association was found between ACL and occupation (P = 0.04).
The cutaneous form occurred in 87.3% of cases.
The medication most often employed was pentavalent antimony (87.3%), with cure achieved in 91.1% of cases.
The epidemiological profile of ACL in the Jequitinhonha Valley is similar to that reported for other regions of Brazil, exhibiting a rural occupational nature and affecting men with low levels of schooling within the productive age.


Abstract
Body mass index changes during highly active antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria.
Wasting remains an important condition in HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
In this study, 120 patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection were prospectively evaluated to determine the effect of HAART on body mass index (BMI).
Eighty-nine (83.1%) patients gained weight, 5 (4.7%) had no weight change, and 13 (12.2%) lost weight.
There was a significant increase in overweight and obese patients.
On multivariate analysis, time-updated CD4 count and higher baseline BMI were associated with a greater increase in BMI.
Anaemia at diagnosis was associated with a significant increase in BMI.
There were no significant effects of age, sex, disease severity, viral load or educational status on BMI changes.
About 27% of the HIV patients presented with weight loss, which emphasizes that weight loss and wasting remain important AIDS-defining conditions, despite the advent of HAART.
A linear association was observed between time-updated CD4 count and increase in BMI.
The association between time-updated CD4 count and greater increase in BMI suggests that BMI could be a surrogate for CD4 count in monitoring treatment response in resource-limited settings.

Abstract
Breastfeeding practice in Kuwait: determinants of success and reasons for failure.
To explore the possible determinants of duration of breastfeeding in Kuwait, 234 mothers completed a questionnaire concerning the feeding of their youngest infant.
The questionnaire addressed the factors that contributed to their willingness to continue breastfeeding and enquired about the factors leading to their decision to end it.
Only 26.5% of the mothers had continued breastfeeding for 6 months or more.
Father's support was a significant factor that encouraged the practice.
In conclusion, preventive strategies are recommended for boosting breastfeeding, with special emphasis on the factors linked to early cessation, aiming at full implementation of the WHO global public health recommendations for successful breastfeeding in Kuwait.


Abstract
The present study examined differences in dietary habits and physical activity levels between students attending private and public high schools in Jordan.
A total of 386 secondary-school males and 349 females aged 14-18 years were randomly recruited using a multistage, stratified, cluster sampling technique.
Dietary habits and physical activity level were self-reported in a validated questionnaire.
The prevalence of obesity was significantly higher among adolescents in private (26.0%) than in public schools (16.7%).
The frequency of breakfast intake was significantly higher among adolescents in private schools, whereas French fries and sweets intake was significantly higher in public schools.


Abstract
FEV1 and FVC pulmonary function reference values among 6-18-year-old children: a multi-centre study in Saudi Arabia.
It is important to establish lung function reference values for each population.
This study aimed to determine the spirometric reference values for healthy Saudi Arabian children and adolescents and to derive prediction equations for these.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthy schoolboys and girls aged 6-18 years old, selected randomly from the 6 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia.
Data were collected by questionnaire and physical examinations including spirometry.
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly higher in males than females.
Height was the anthropometric variable most strongly correlated with FEV1 (r = 0.
In males the multivariate linear regression model explained 53.9% of FEV1 and 35.1% of FVC variations.
In females it explained 25.3% of FEV1 and 16.5% of FVC variations.
All changes in R² were statistically significant.


Abstract
Childhood very severe pneumonia and meningitis-related hospitalization and death in Yemen, before and after introduction of H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine.
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was included in the Yemen immunization programme in 2005.
This study compared the rates of very severe pneumonia and all-cause meningitis hospitalization and death, before and after introduction of conjugate Hib vaccine, and reports the results of the 2010 bacterial meningitis surveillance.
A retrospective analysis was made of data collected for 2000-2010 for all children aged 2-60 months in the main children's hospital in Sana'a.
Compared with the pre-Hib vaccination period, the post-Hib period showed significant and impressive reductions in the rates of hospitalization and death for all-cause meningitis.
Very severe pneumonia remains the leading cause of severe morbidity and death for young children, particularly those aged < 12 months.


Abstract
Case management of childhood tuberculosis in children's hospitals in Khartoum.
No published information is available on the case management of childhood tuberculosis (TB) in Sudan.
The aim of this study was to describe the case management of childhood TB in 4 children's hospitals in Khartoum State, Sudan.
Data on 467 children aged 0-14 years registered in 2009 were collected from patient records; 52.9% males and 53.0% aged 5-14 years.
Most cases were registered as new cases (89.5%) and most had pulmonary TB (72.4%).
Of all cases, 31.0% had sputum smear microscopy done, 35.8% had X-ray and none had a record of being culture confirmed.
Category III regimen was given to 58.5%.
Reported outcomes were: cured (1.5%), completed treatment (14.6%), transferred out (13.1%), default (17.3%), death (4.3%) and treatment failure (0.6%).
Age was significantly associated with treatment outcome, while sex, type of patient, site of TB and treatment category were not significant.
Case management of childhood TB is suboptimal in this region.


Abstract
Qualitative adaptation of child behaviour problem instruments in a developing-country setting.
A key barrier to epidemiological research on child behaviour problems in developing countries is the lack of culturally relevant, internationally recognized psychometric instruments.
This model encompassed a systematic procedure with 6 distinct phases to minimize bias and ensure equivalence with the original instruments: selection, deliberation, alteration, feasibility, testing and formal approval.
The process was conducted in collaboration with the instruments' developer.
A multidisciplinary working group of experts identified equivalence issues and suggested modifications.
Focus group discussions with informants highlighted comprehension issues.
Subsequently modified instruments were thoroughly tested.
Finally, the instruments' developer approval further validated the qualitative adaptation.
The study proposes a rigorous and systematic model to effectively achieve cultural adaptation of psychometric instruments.


Abstract
Association of cerebral palsy with consanguineous parents and other risk factors in a Palestinian population.
This case-control study investigated risk factors for cerebral palsy in a Palestinian population.
Data were collected from medical records and a structured questionnaire to parents.
Other risk factors were: perinatal hypoxia (OR = 92.5; 95% CI: 24.5-350), low birth weight (OR = 4.98; 95% CI: 2.01-12.3), twin births (OR = 9.25; 95% CI: 1.29-66.8) and no prenatal medical care (OR = 5.22; 95% CI: 1.18-23.1).
This first stepwise model of significant and modifiable risk factors in our population provides useful evidence for policy-makers.


Abstract
Impairments of the central motor system can either be congenital (e. g. cerebral palsy) or acquired (e. g. traumatic brain injury, stroke).
These lesions are the most frequent morbidities necessitating neuro-rehabilitative measures in childhood.


Abstract
Currently, end-to-end ductal anastomosis is the biliary reconstruction of choice for liver transplantation in most adult patients.
In recent years, it has also been performed for liver transplantation in children and in select patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The procedure is also performed in some patients with iatrogenic bile duct injuries, as it establishes physiologic bile flow.
Proper digestion and absorption as well as postoperative endoscopic access are possible in patients who undergo end-to-end ductal anastomosis.
It allows endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in patients following surgery.
This anastomosis is technically simple and associated with fewer early postoperative complications than the Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; however, end-to-end ductal anastomosis is not possible to perform in all patients.
This review discusses the indications for and limitations of this biliary reconstruction, the technique used in liver transplantation and surgical repair of injured bile ducts, suture types and use of a T-tube.

Abstract
In this retrospective study, the tolerance to subcutaneus mistletoe injections (Viscum album L.), adverse reactions and possible indications have been evaluated in feline patients of a small animal clinic.
Among the 22 cats treated between 2008 and 2013, 4 did not accept the injections done by the owner, 7 showed slight short time adverse reactions, that disappeared spontaneously.
No long term (more than 70 days) adverse reaction directly related to the Viscum album treatment could be identified.
This study shows that Iscador(®) can be injected subcutaneously without a risk of worsening of the clinical signs or exacerbation of tumors.
The antitumoral, but also immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties offer interesting treatment opportunities for dermatologic, odonto-stomatologic or allergic patients.

Abstract
A review of current timed-AI (TAI) programs for beef and dairy cattle.
Estrus detection is required for artificial insemination (AI), but it is done poorly in dairy cattle and it is difficult in beef cattle.
Protocols that synchronize follicle growth, corpus luteum regression and ovulation, allowing for TAI, result in improved reproductive performance, because all animals are inseminated whether they show estrus or not.
As result, TAI programs have become an integral part of reproductive management in many dairy herds and offer beef producers the opportunity to incorporate AI into their herds.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone-based protocols are commonly used in North America for estrus synchronization as part of a TAI program.
Protocols that increase pregnancy rates in lactating dairy cows and suckling beef cows have been developed.
Protocols that improve pregnancy rates in heifers, acyclic beef cows, and resynchronized lactating dairy cows are also discussed.

Abstract
The World Health Organization has endorsed the use of outreach to promote: efficient redeployment of the health-care workforce; continuity of care at the local level; and professional support for local, rural, health-care workers.
Australia is the only country that has had, since 2000, a sustained national policy on outreach for subsidizing medical specialist outreach to rural areas.
This paper describes the adoption, implementation and prioritization of a national specialist outreach policy in Australia.
Initially the policy supported only new outreach services but concerns about the sustainability of existing services resulted in eligibility for funding being extended to all specialist services.
The costs of travel, travel time, accommodation, professional support, staff relief at specialists' primary practices and equipment hire were subsidized.
Over time, a national political commitment to the equitable treatment of indigenous people resulted in more targeted support for outreach in remote areas.
Current priorities are: (i) establishing team-based outreach services; (ii) improving local staff's skills; (iii) achieving local coordination; and (iv) conducting a nationally consistent needs assessment.
The absence of subsidies for specialists' clinical work can discourage private specialists from providing services in remote areas where clinical throughput is low.
To be successful, outreach policy must harmonize with the interests of the workforce and support professional autonomy.
Internationally, the development of outreach policy must take account of the local pay and practice conditions of health workers.


Abstract
More recently, Eli Lilly challenged Canada's invalidation of a pharmaceutical patent under an IIA.
All of the cases claim that the intellectual property rights of the investor were infringed.
This article does not argue against IIAs.
Instead, it seeks to demonstrate how more sophisticated treaty drafting can neutralize the threat to public health.


Abstract
Snakebite envenoming is a common but neglected public health problem, particularly in impoverished rural regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America.
The only validated treatment for this condition is passive immunotherapy with safe and effective animal-derived antivenoms.
However, there is a long-lasting crisis in the availability of these life-saving medications, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.
We herein advocate a multicomponent strategy to substantially improve the availability of safe and effective antivenoms at the global level.
These ways of making antivenom available should be complemented by actions to improve health information systems, the accessibility of antivenoms, the training of medical and nursing staff, and community-based education.
Such a multicomponent strategy involving stakeholders on many levels could help consolidate sustainable improvements in antivenom availability worldwide.


Abstract
Reducing maternal and child mortality is a priority in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and will likely remain so after 2015.
Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required.
Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries.
The Success Factors for Women's and Children's Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a.
There is no standard formula--fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change.
However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality.
First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants.
Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health.
Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change.
Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time.
This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women's and children's health towards 2015 and beyond.


Abstract
A survey found that many hand surgeons have revisited implant arthroplasty because it preserves critical structures.
The present study was the first to use and evaluate early outcomes of pyrocarbon spherical implants for arthroplasty of the first CMC in patients with Eaton-Littler stage II and III osteoarthritis.
A single surgeon performed 24 arthroplasties (23 patients [20 women, three men] with a mean age of 56 years [range 46 to 75 years]) of the first CMC (nine right hands and 15 left hands) using pyrocarbon spherical implants from May 2010 to April 2013.
All patients failed conservative management.
At a mean (± SD) of 18.5±11.16 months postoperatively (range 4.3 to 38.9 months), the mean Kapandji score was 8.8 of 10 (range 7 to 10), the average pre- and postoperative values on the visual pain scale were 8.96±0.64 of 10 (range 8 to 10) and 1.13±1.22 of 10 (range 0 to 4), respectively.
All patients were either very satisfied (score = 5) or satisfied (score = 4) with the procedure, with a mean satisfaction score of 4.76±0.44 of 5.00 (range 4 to 5).
The mean postoperative Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score was 11.79±14.29 (range 0 to 49.17).
The most recent radiographic evaluations confirmed that all implants were stable with no erosion of nearby cancellous bone.
There were no implant subluxations, dislocations or revisions.
Early outcomes show promising results and support continued use of this implant for arthroplasty.
However, longer-term follow-up will be needed to confirm these results.


Abstract
The Canadian health care system was designed to ensure that all Canadian citizens would receive equal access to health care.
However, in rural areas of Canada, patients are required to travel long distances and pay significant out-of-pocket expenses to access health care.
The present study attempted to quantify the added out-of-pocket costs that rural Saskatchewan residents must pay to receive plastic surgical specialist care compared with urban residents of Saskatoon.
A cost analysis was performed to generate a numerical value that would represent a minimum cost for patients travelling from three different locations within the province.
The fundamental principle of the Canadian health care system is equal access to necessary health care for all Canadians.
Despite this, inequalities persist.
These unfunded costs represent a significant barrier to health care access in Canada and serve to propagate inequalities in the nation's heath care system.

Abstract
Validity and reliability of the Arabic short version of the child oral health-related quality of life questionnaire (CPQ 11-14) in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
The Arabic version of the Child Perception Questionnaire for assessing oral health-related quality of life in 11-14 year olds (CPQ 11-14) has been validated previously.
This study tested the validity and reliability of a short version of the Arabic CPQ 11-14 in the general population of Medina, Saudi Arabia.
A total of 268 schoolchildren completed the questionnaire and were examined to determine the prevalence of caries and malocclusion.
The mean total score was 8.53 (SD 8.18), and 7% of children scored zero.
There was a significant association between malocclusion and oral symptoms and between DMFT score and functional limitations.
The test-retest reliability (0.78) and Cronbach alpha (0.82) were excellent.
The construct validity was acceptable for oral health (ρ = 0.37) and overall well-being (ρ = 0.40).
The Arabic version of the short form CPQ 11-14 was reliable and valid for this general population of children.


Abstract
[Integrated management of mother and child health in the region of Monastir (Tunisia)].
The programme of integrated management of child health (IMCI) was established in Tunisia in 2002 in some health districts.
This study evaluated the management of children under 5 years of age and their mothers using the IMCI programme in Zeramdine, a town 20 km south-west of Monastir.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 526 medical records of children under 5 years attending the Zeramdine maternal and child health centre.
The study evaluated preventive and curative aspects of child health.
The mean age was 21.9 (SD 16.7) months.
On the curative side, respiratory diseases were the leading reason for consultation (71.2%) followed by diarrhoea (15.4%).
For preventive services, physicians systematically checked the child's immunization status and height and weight on the growth charts, and screened for strabismus and anaemia.
The contribution to child health of IMCI is undeniable; it allows comprehensive care of the child, develops staff skills, upgrades the health system and improves family and community practices.


Abstract
Seat-belt use among drivers and front passengers: an observational study from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study aimed to measure the rate of use of seat-belts and factors affecting their use in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.
The most frequently reported reasons for using seat-belts were avoiding fines, fear of injuries and respecting the law.
To improve seat-belt use, it is recommended that law enforcement accompanied by public education should be a priority.


Abstract
Tehran dentists' knowledge and attitudes towards hepatitis B and their willingness to treat simulated hepatitis B positive patients.
The dental profession has a high risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) contamination and can play a crucial role in controlling HBV cross-contamination.
Later, the dentists were interviewed regarding their knowledge about hepatitis B and attitude to HBV-positive patients.
The mean knowledge score of dentists was 14.3 (SD 6.9) out of 44 and the mean attitude score was 20.0 (SD 3.6) out of 39.
A majority of dentists (55.6%) were willing to treat a patient with HBV, unconditionally or with conditions.
Some individual attitude items correlated with knowledge items concerning transmission of the virus and its prevention.


Abstract
Tobacco control efforts in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries: achievements and challenges.
This paper reports a review into the current state of tobacco use, governance and national commitment for control, and current intervention frameworks in place to reduce the use of tobacco among the populations of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states and Yemen.
Our findings show that tobacco control in the GCC countries has witnessed real progress over the past decades.
Future investment in implementation and enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, production of robust tobacco control legislation and the establishment of universally available tobacco cessation services are essential to sustain and strengthen tobacco control in the GCC region.


Abstract
Traumatic brachial plexus root avulsions are devastating injuries, and are complex and challenging to reconstruct.
Double free muscle transfer using the gracilis muscles is a potentially effective method of restoring upper extremity function.
The authors report on the first two patients treated using this technique in Canada.
Both sustained traumatic brachial plexus root avulsion injuries resulting in a flail arm.
In the first step of this two-stage procedure, a gracilis muscle was transferred to restore elbow flexion, and wrist and digit extension.
Months later, the transfer of the second gracilis muscle was performed to enhance elbow flexion and to enable wrist and digit flexion.
Postoperatively, both patients achieved Medical Research Council grade 4 elbow flexion, functional handgrip and were able to return to gainful employment.
Patient satisfaction was high and active range of motion improved substantially.
The authors' experience supports the use of this technique following severe brachial plexus injury.


Abstract
Several surgical techniques have been described for auricular reconstruction.
Autologous reconstruction using costal cartilage is the most widely accepted technique of microtia repair.
However, other techniques have certain indications and should be discussed with patients and families when planning for an auricular reconstruction.
In the present review, the authors discuss the main surgical techniques for auricular reconstruction including autologous costal cartilage graft, Medpor (Stryker, USA) implant and prosthetic reconstruction.


Abstract
The hand is an integral component of the human body, with an incredible spectrum of functionality.
In addition to possessing gross and fine motor capabilities essential for physical survival, the hand is fundamental to social conventions, enabling greeting, grooming, artistic expression and syntactical communication.
The loss of one or both hands is, thus, a devastating experience, requiring significant psychological support and physical rehabilitation.
The majority of hand amputations occur in working-age males, most commonly as a result of work-related trauma or as casualties sustained during combat.
For millennia, humans have used state-of-the-art technology to design clever devices to facilitate the reintegration of hand amputees into society.
The present article provides a historical overview of the progress in replacing a missing hand, from early iron hands intended primarily for use in battle, to today's standard body-powered and myoelectric prostheses, to revolutionary advancements in the restoration of sensorimotor control with targeted reinnervation and hand transplantation.


Abstract
Rather than estimating it from external observations, interview, or clinical assessment, it is best measured by direct query.
Due to a perception that respondents may not be reliable or credible, there has been some reluctance to use self-report outcomes in psychiatry.
With few exceptions, psychiatric patients are credible and reliable reporters of this information.
This article summarizes studies that highlight the development, validation, and application of HRQoL measures in psychiatry.
Thoughtful application of these tools in psychiatric research can provide a much-needed patient perspective in the future of comparative effectiveness research, patient-centered outcomes research, and clinical care.


Abstract
Validated measures for depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders are available in adult psychiatry, and are increasingly used in research.


Abstract
This article provides an overview of the conceptual foundations of measuring health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents in child and adolescent psychiatry, and of the current state of research in this field.
The available procedures for determining quality of life are presented according to their areas of use and their psychometric characteristics.
The identified instruments satisfy the individual criteria to different degrees.
They are increasingly being used in health services research, treatment studies, and epidemiological research; however, they are not yet widely used as part of the clinical routine in child and adolescent psychiatrics.


Abstract
Furthermore, caregivers become partners in care for patients with mental disorders, and health workers are more attentive to the expectations and needs of caregivers.
A number of outcomes for caregivers are measured and used in daily practice in order to promote actions to improve health care systems and progress in research on the impact of mental disorders on their caregivers.
Finally, we propose some recommendations promoting the development of relevant outcome measures for caregivers and their integration into current systems of care.


Abstract
The complete data on QoL, functioning, and depressive symptom severity, were analyzed for each STAR*D level 2 treatment.


Abstract
The aim of the present article is to review QoL scales used in studies investigating patients with schizophrenia over the past 5 years, and to summarize the results of QoL assessment in clinical practice in these patients.
Literature available from January 2009 to December 2013 was identified in a PubMed search using the key words "quality of life" and "schizophrenia" and in a cross-reference search for articles that were particularly relevant.
A total of n=432 studies used 35 different standardized generic and specific QoL scales in patients with schizophrenia.
Affective symptoms were major obstacles for QoL improvement in patients with schizophrenia.
Though positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive functioning may be seen as largely independent parameters from subjective QoL, especially in cross-sectional trials, long-term studies confirmed a critical impact of early QoL improvement on long-term symptomatic and functional remission, as well as of early symptomatic response on long-term QoL.
Results of the present review suggest that QoL is a valid and useful outcome criterion in patients with schizophrenia.
As such, it should be consistently applied in clinical trials.
Understanding the relationship between symptoms and functioning with QoL is important because interventions that focus on symptoms of psychosis or functioning alone may fail to improve subjective QoL to the same level.
However, the lack of consensus on QoL scales hampers research on its predictive validity.
Future research needs to find a consensus on the concept and measures of QoL and to test whether QoL predicts better outcomes with respect to remission and recovery under consideration of different treatment approaches in patients with schizophrenia.


Abstract
Specific recommendations are made for a more collaborative approach with patients in psychiatric and community care and clinical research.


Abstract
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated with long-lasting psychological suffering, distressing psychosocial disability, markedly reduced health-related quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality in a subgroup of individuals in the aftermath of serious traumatic events.
Here we outline two different pharmacotherapeutic trends that aim to modify the encoding, consolidation, and rehearsal of traumatic memory in order to reduce the risk of PTSD immediately after trauma exposure on the one hand, and that endeavor to treat the clinical state of PTSD on the other.
Empirical evidence may inform clinicians in their clinical efforts for this special group of patients.
Ethical issues have to be considered, particularly in the context of pharmacological strategies projected to prevent PTSD in the aftermath of traumatic exposure.


Abstract
The present review ultimately included a total of 155 unique articles and 22 PROMs.
An examination of the PROs revealed that OCD patients tend to suffer from significant functional disability, and report lower HRQoL than controls.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the measures reviewed lacked patient input in their development.
Future research on PROMs must involve patient perspectives and include rigorous psychometric evaluation of these measures.


Abstract
Typically, PROs include self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews.


Abstract
Suicide rates in Switzerland and most other countries are higher among the elderly than among the population as a whole.
Suicidality in the old age is commonly associated with the presence of a mental disorder, especially depression.
A new practical approach called PRISM-S task enables an assessment of the degree of suicidality in less than five minutes with a simple, visual instrument.
Besides the importance of public mental health measures PRISM-S offers a brief, easy-to-administer method for all healthcare professionals to assess suicidality in adult patients (18-65 years).
Further investigation will explore its specific usefulness for elderly patients (over 65 years).


Abstract
[Depression and burnout].
Severe burnout fulfills mostly the criteria for an adjustment disorder.
The treating physician is supposed to clarify the causes of a burnout.
In addition to the causes related to working conditions, the role of certain personality traits should be elucidated.
Psychological/psychotherapeutic approaches preferably focus on stress reduction.
Empirical evidence for these approaches is rather weak.


Abstract
In respect of demographic change, the number of older patients with substance abuse and addiction is on the raise.
Daily and risky alcohol consumption is common among older people.
For early detection, laboratory parameters and questionnaires such as the AUDIT-C are suitable.
Therapeutically brief interventions have been proved successful.
The physician has to know the correct indication, adequate dosage and pharmacological interactions.
A slow-dose reduction is recommended in case of addiction.
Thanks to opioid substitution therapy, patients with an opioidaddiction can reach a higher age.
Age influences the effects of the substitute, which may require an adjustment of the dosage.


Abstract
The present article gives a survey over the current scientific knowledge of the canine neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL).
NCL is a heterogenous group of lysosomal storage diseases in humans and animals.
In consequence of a gene mutation, there is an accumulation of ceroid-lipofuscin in neurons, cells of the retina and the skin and other cells.
The stored ceroid-lipofuscin in neurons leads to an impaired cell function and subsequently to cell death.
Recently, the underlying genetic defect was discovered in several dog breeds.


Abstract
Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, barometric pressure and precipitation were recorded.
Meteorological conditions were very similar at both locations.

Housing conditions significantly affected claw dimensions.


Abstract
The impact of in utero cocaine exposure on pregnancy and the baby has received significant media attention in preceding decades because of fears of teratogenicity, long-term health consequences, and poor cognitive and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
We sought to review the medical literature examining these phenomena.
We identified risks to the pregnancy and baby in women abusing cocaine during pregnancy.


Abstract
Clinicians routinely encounter patients suffering from both degenerative and acute spinal pain, often as a consequence of pathology affecting the intervertebral disc (IVD).
The IVD is a complex structure essential to spinal function and is subject to degenerative disease and injury.
However, due to the complexity of spinal pain syndromes it is often difficult to determine the extent of the IVD's contribution to the genesis of spinal pain.
The location of the IVD is within close proximity to vital neural elements and may in the event of pathological change or injury compromise those structures.


Abstract
The mortality rate associate to this type of cancer is elevated and a rapid medical referral is required for patients presenting this condition.
Pleural effusion may be the only visible sign.
We report a case of pleural effusion secondary to a cancer of unknown primary site in a 60-year-old man that sought chiropractic care for radiating low back pain.


Abstract
Yet minimal training in cultural competency in chiropractic education leaves graduates ill-equipped to treat a diverse population.
Some journal articles note that promoting multicultural education and cultural sensitivity is an important goal.
However, they provide no mechanisms as to how this can be achieved within training programs.


Abstract
The purpose of this case report is to describe the clinical presentation of a patient who suffered from a fracture of the lateral tubercle of the posterior talar process caused by a fall while rock-climbing.
Plain film radiography revealed a fracture of the posterior process of the talus.


Abstract
Congenital scoliosis due to vertebral anomalies may occur in less than 0.1% of the population.
Several different theories have been put forth in the literature to account for the etiology of congenital scoliosis and the vertebral anomalies which contribute to its development.
The study of scoliosis in twins has contributed to the understanding of causative factors including genetics, environment and in utero events during embryologic development.
Case reports of fraternal (non-identical) juvenile male twins with congenital scoliosis associated with differing congenital vertebral anomalies are presented.
Both children were asymptomatic at the time of the initial consultation and showed no signs of neurologic compromise.


Abstract
Falls are a common and serious risk with an aging population.
Screening for falls should be done yearly for all patients 65 years and older or in those with a predisposing medical condition.
Additional specific falls prevention professional education would enable the chiropractor to best assist these patients.
Collaboration and communication with the patient's family physician offers an opportunity for improved interprofessional dialogue to enhance patient care related to falls risk.
Frequently falls prevention strategies are implemented by an interprofessional team.
Chiropractors increasingly contribute within multidisciplinary teams.
Collaboration by the chiropractor requires both simple screening and knowledge of health care system navigation.
Such awareness can permit optimal participation in the care of their patient and the best outcome.


Abstract
In this study we aimed to evaluate primarily the relationship between high or low volume Foley catheters used for cervical ripening and Caesarean section, and secondarily the relationship between Foley catheter volume, cervical ripeness, and time to delivery.
We searched Medline and Embase from their inceptions with the assistance of an experienced librarian.
All abstracts and complete articles were independently reviewed by two reviewers, according to predefined inclusion criteria.
Six hundred forty-eight abstracts were identified, and 30 complete articles were read in full.
Three articles with a total of 575 participating women met the inclusion criteria.
The rate of Caesarean section with use of 80 mL Foley catheters was not significantly different from the rate using 30 mL Foley catheters (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.41).
A favourable cervix (which was defined heterogeneously) was more common with high volume catheters (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.04), and failure to deliver in 24 hours was lower (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90).
High volume Foley catheters improve the likelihood of a favourable cervix and chance of delivery in 24 hours more than low volume Foley catheters.
As a more favourable cervix before induction of labour is associated with a lower rate of Caesarean section, a randomized controlled trial comparing high and low volume Foley catheters for cervical ripening using Caesarean section as the primary outcome is warranted.


Abstract
However, the symptoms are usually physical and psychological signs of chronic stress.
There is often a lack of awareness of stressors or conflicts, which would allow such a conclusion.
Otherwise the patient should be prepared and motivated for a psychosocial counselling.


Abstract
Treatment of hepatitis C is approaching a revolution.
During the last years, many agents have been developed that directly interfere with the viral replication cycle.
Therapy of hepatitis C will no longer need Interferon in the future.
The new therapies will be shorter, more efficient and with fewer side effects.
For patients, the burden of treatment will drop substantially.


Abstract
Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) represent a recognized component of care in the treatment of complex conditions such as burns.
However, most institutions do not provide adequate support for the formation of these teams.
Furthermore, the majority of specialists lack the managerial skills required to create a team and have difficulties finding the proper tools.
Our objective is to provide an insight for health care professionals, who wish to form a MDT for burn treatment, on the challenges that are likely to be faced, and to identify key elements that may facilitate the establishment of such a project.
The setting for this was a plastic surgery department and rehabilitation center at a national reference center.
A qualitative analysis was performed on all correspondences related to our tetraplegia project, from 2006 to 2008.
To guide our thematic analysis, we used a form of systems theory known as the complexity theory.
The qualitative analysis was performed using the NVivo software (Version 8.0 QSR International Melbourne, Australia).
Lastly, the data was organized in chronologic order.
Three main themes emerged from the results: knowledge acquisition, project organizational setup and project steps design.
These themes represented respectively 24%, 50% and 26% of all correspondences.
Project steps design and knowledge acquisition correspondences increased significantly after the introduction of the mentor team to our network.
We conclude that an early association with a mentor team is beneficial for the establishment of a MDT.


Abstract
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of faecal management systems in improving survival of patients with extensive burns involving the perineum.
All adults with burns of more than 30% total body surface area (TBSA) who were actively treated in our regional burn service between December 2008 and July 2012 were reviewed and compared to an historical cohort of 18 adult patients with similar injury involving the perineum, treated in our regional burn service between 1999 and 2001.
For the last five years, faecal management systems (FMS) have been in use for patients with extensive burns involving the perineum.
Sixteen patients with burns greater than 30% TBSA involving the perineal region were admitted during this period and all were managed with FMS.
Four of the 16 patients (25%) managed with FMS died compared to 11 of the 18 patients (61%) in the historical cohort.
The survival of patients with extensive burns involving the perineal region was improved using FMS.
No significant complications were reported in relation to the use of FMS.
FMS allows faecal diversion, reduced perineal soiling and improved personal hygiene.
We believe this allows easier management of these difficult injuries, may reduce the incidence of sepsis and improves survival.


Abstract
Limited availability of autologous donor sites poses significant challenges for soft-tissue reconstruction in severe and complex burns.
Integra™ is a bi-layered dermal regeneration template (DRT) which has played a significant role in soft tissue reconstruction since its initial use for full-thickness burn defects.
The purpose of this study is to report our institutional experience of Integra™ in burns management over a 4-year period and highlight an unusual reaction to its second application.
Twenty-four cases underwent Integra™ resurfacing for burn management from September 2007 to August 2011.
Data on patient demographics, including co-morbidities, indications, operative data, complications, secondary reconstruction and outcomes were recorded.
Integra™ was used in 24 patients on 37 anatomical sites.
One patient died 3 weeks after injury and first stage of Integra™ application, and was therefore excluded from the study.
The average length of hospital stay was 47 days (with a range of 1-162 days).
The mean follow-up time was 17 months (with a range of 9-34 months).
Overall, our experience with DRT was mixed, that is to say we found it satisfactory with acute burns resurfacing but very good with secondary reconstruction.
The main advantage of Integra™ is its immediate availability in unlimited quantities for soft-tissue reconstruction in major and complex burns.
The main drawbacks are financial implications, twostage procedure, complex wound care and risk of infection.
We believe that Integra™ can be considered as a promising modality in burns management.


Abstract
Made by bees from the nectar of flowers, used since ancient times to treat wounds and burns, honey has lately acquired a growing interest from the international scientific community and has been the subject of many specialized studies and communications.
This article highlights the up-to-date knowledge on qualities, properties and mode of appliance of honey in the treatment of wounds of various etiologies, particularly burns, through an extensive retrospective analysis of data from the literature.
This article aims to review and provide a synthesis of current issues regarding the complex action of honey on burn wounds, evidenced by in vitro studies, laboratory experiments and clinical trials published in the specialized literature.
The present work analyzes extensively the anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory properties of honey, as well as its favorable effect on wound regeneration.
Effectiveness of topical administration of honey is evidenced both by a series of experiments on laboratory animals and by clinical trials.
This article also draws the attention of both medical staff and patients to the possibility of using this product, and to its acceptability in practice.


Abstract
The management of burns within the first hours of injury has a significant impact on mortality and morbidity.
A total of twenty-four family physicians (100%) participated in this study.
The questionnaire findings showed that, out of a possible score of 25 correct answers, the highest result was 12; achieved by 6 physicians (25%).
The highest frequency score was 8 correct responses; obtained by 10 physicians (29.2%).


Abstract
Significant improvements have been made in the acute treatment of pediatric burn injuries over the past 3 decades which have significantly decreased mortality.
Each year, more burned children are necessitating serious medical attention during their convalescence.
For children with serious consequences resulting from burns that can persist from childhood through adolescence into adulthood, the value of long-term rehabilitation cannot be over stated.
Burn injury management should not focus only on the immediate treatment.
The present is a review of the available modalities utilized for the physical rehabilitation of convalescent pediatric burns in order to overcome the catabolic state, improve muscle power and fitness, reduce disfiguring scars and prevent contractures.


Abstract
However, donor sites for these cells are still under investigation.
The aim of this study is to review the efficacy of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in accelerating wound healing of third degree burns in a mouse model.
To this end, forty healthy male inbred Balb/c mice were selected and set up as an experimental model for third degree burn wounds.
They were randomly divided into 3 equally sized groups: the ADSCs group, the mechanically prepared adipose tissue group, and the control group.
The wounds were examined daily until the mice were sacrificed for tissue sampling in the 3(rd) week.
Our results showed that wound surface area and eschar thickness were smaller in the ADSCs group throughout the study period, although there was no significant difference between the groups for decreasing values of wound area characteristics.
In terms of wound healing parameters, lymphocyte and macrophage cell counts were larger in the ADSCs group compared to the other groups.
Fibroplasia, collagen synthesis and remodeling were more aberrant in this group.
However, there was no statistically significant difference in either of these observed differences (p>0.05).
Although enzymatically prepared ADSCs seem a potential treatment in wound healing, our study of a mouse model burn wound revealed no significant improvement in using this option.


Abstract
About 15% of the women and 10% of the men past the age of 65 years suffer from urinary incontinence.
In most cases, accurate history taking can help differentiate between urge incontinence, stress incontinence and overflow incontinence, and is essential in choosing the appropriate treatment.
Initial diagnostic testing can be conducted by the general practitioner, especially tests to exclude urinary tract infections or to rule out an overactive bladder.
Also, drug treatment can be initiated in general practice.
Patients with refractory urinary incontinence, particularly those who did not respond to anticholinergic medication, should be referred to a urologist for further evaluation since there may be an underlying tumour or other disorder of the bladder that is causing the incontinence.


Abstract
The knowledge about this lighter autistic disorder spread only slowly.
The increasing prevalence rates can be explained by the increased knowledge about this disorder and the growing clinical experience.


Abstract
The aim of a clinical trial is to judge the efficacy of a new therapy or drug.


Abstract
This study evaluates the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens cultured from 3'954 quarter milk samples from dairy cows in Switzerland.
Ideally the selection of the antibacterial drug for the treatment of intramammary infection should be based on antibiotic susceptibility testing.


Abstract
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed by histological findings.


Abstract
Status epilepticus after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) is rare.
The authors report a case involving a 65-year-old man with nonconvulsive status epilepticus 34 days after umbilical cord blood transplantion for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Cerebrospinal fluid and serum were positive for human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6).
Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed symmetric T2 hyper-intensity bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobes, and T2 hyperintensi-ties and restricted diffusion of bilateral putamina.
Despite aggressive anticonvulsive therapy, his seizures only abated with initiation of ganciclovir therapy.
The patient completed six weeks of combination antiviral therapy (ganciclovir and foscarnet).
HHV6 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus after alloHCT, especially in patients with hyponatremia.
Empirical antiviral therapy targeting HHV6 should be administered to these patients.


Abstract
The present report describes a case of chronic melioidosis in a returning traveller from the Philippines.


Abstract
Blood transfusions are in general considered as lifesaving.
Current data and evidence show, that blood transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and this apparently dose-dependent.
Furthermore, blood transfusions are more costly than previously assumed.
For these reasons novel approaches in the treatment of anemia and bleeding are needed.
In 2010 the World Health Organization has claimed PBM to be considered as golden standard.
PBM reduces morbidity and mortality by lowering the excessive use of blood transfusions.
This concept has partially and successfully been implemented in the University Hospital Balgrist in Zurich.


Abstract
Good core muscles strength is essential for daily life and sports activities.
However, the mechanism how core muscles may be effectively triggered by exercises is not yet precisely described in the literature.
A total of 16 studies were included.


Abstract
The authors report on their experience with using hyaluronic acid of non-animal origin manufactured using commercially available technology (Macrolane, Q-Med AB, Sweden) for breast enhancement in 4000 women treated since 2004 and describe the most common complications and their successful treatment.
On average, 30 mL to 40 mL of Macrolane was injected into each breast.
There were no serious systemic events and treatment was well tolerated.


Abstract
With a mean follow-up of three years, there was only one recurrence (1.7%).
Mean total operative time was 1 h 47 min.


Abstract
A three-year-old boy was investigated for inexplicable incessant crying.
On examination, his left wrist was mildly swollen (three to four months) and sensitive.
Exploration and carpal tunnel decompression of the left wrist with incisional biopsy was performed for the presence of a fusiform swelling intimately associated with the median nerve.
Histopathology revealed the presence of enlarged nerve bundles admixed with mature fat cells and diffuse fibroblastic proliferation.
Three months later, he underwent urgent contralateral carpal tunnel decompression for a similar presentation.
The final diagnosis was bilateral fibrolipomatous hamartoma (FLH) of the median nerves causing acute bilateral compression neuropathy.
FLH of the median nerve is an extremely unusual cause of acute bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in a young child presenting with 'incessant crying'.
A comprehensive review of FLH including epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, imaging, pathology, treatment and prognosis is discussed.


Abstract
An excision biopsy was performed, revealing a possible peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour as the primary pathology.


Abstract
Although inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (IMTs) have been accepted as a clonal neoplasm, their pathology is poorly understood due to variable presentation.
In the current WHO classification, IMTs are designated as intermediate malignancies.
In terms of biological potential, IMTs are classified under 'rarely metastasizing'.
IMTs are rare in the maxillary sinus but, when reported, can be locally aggressive or even destructive if they invade the orbit.


Abstract
Recent studies have resulted in major changes in the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children.
The present statement focuses on the diagnosis and management of infants and children >2 months of age with an acute UTI and no known underlying urinary tract pathology or risk factors for a neurogenic bladder.
UTI should be ruled out in preverbal children with unexplained fever and in older children with symptoms suggestive of UTI (dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, abdominal pain, back pain or new daytime incontinence).
A bagged urine sample may be used for urinalysis but should not be used for urine culture.
Antibiotic treatment for seven to 10 days is recommended for febrile UTI.
Oral antibiotics may be offered as initial treatment when the child is not seriously ill and is likely to receive and tolerate every dose.
Children <2 years of age should be investigated after their first febrile UTI with a renal/bladder ultrasound to identify any significant renal abnormalities.
A voiding cystourethrogram is not required for children with a first UTI unless the renal/bladder ultrasound reveals findings suggestive of vesicoureteral reflux, selected renal anomalies or obstructive uropathy.


Abstract
Early daily interactions in a child's life, frequent and positive, are crucial to optimal human development.
The negative effects of maternal depression may include her perception of the child, the child's cognitive development and future antisocial behaviour.
Emerging research investigating paternal depression is also concerning.
Signs of maternal depression can be observed through either an intrusive or withdrawn maternal-infant interaction.


Abstract
Pattern of cigarette and waterpipe smoking in the adult population of Jordan.
An increasing prevalence of smoking in Jordan has been noted and this necessitates understanding the social behaviours that have lead to this habit.
This cross-sectional, descriptive study determined the prevalence of smoking among Jordanians in relation to demographics with a focus on 4 types of tobacco products-cigarettes, waterpipes, cigars and pipes.
A population sample of 3196 adults aged 18+ years answered an interview questionnaire about their smoking habit and types and amounts of tobacco consumed.
Overall 32.3% of the respondents reported being current smokers (54.9% of males and 8.3% of females) and 2.9% were ex-smokers.
Cigarette smoking was the most frequent type of tobacco smoking (93.0%) and one-third of cigarette smokers consumed more than 20 cigarettes per day.
Waterpipe smoking was the second most common habit (8.6%) and was significantly associated with lower age in both males and females.
Reducing the high rate of smoking in Jordan must be a priority.


Abstract
Quitting smoking and utilization of smoking cessation services in Jordan: a population-based survey.
Increasing rates of smoking in Jordan have been documented.
It is therefore important to understand the trends and factors associated with attempts to quit smoking, such as the utilization of smoking cessation clinics and hotlines.
A high percentage of current smokers (62.8%) had tried, unsuccessfully, to quit smoking.
Almost half of them had heard of smoking cessation clinics and hotlines, but only 2.4% had ever utilized them.
After being informed about these services, 53.0% of current smokers agreed that they were likely to utilize them.
Only 19.9% of current smokers had ever received advice from a health-care practitioner about contacting these services.
The study should guide decision-makers on strategies to reduce the high smoking rates in Jordan.


Abstract
Household storage of medicines and self-medication practices in south-east Islamic Republic of Iran.
Self-medication and inappropriate storage of medicines at home are potential health risks.
This crosssectional study in south-east Islamic Republic of Iran in 2010 aimed to determine where householders kept their medicines and to assess the frequency and determinants of self-medication.
Householders from different parts of Birjand city (n = 500) were visited and completed a semi-structured questionnaire.
Analgesics were the most common medicines stored at home, followed by adult cold remedies and antibiotics.
The refrigerator was the most common place for storing medicines (50.6%).
Most householders did not consult the package inserts.
Many householders (53.6%) reported that they practised self-medication, and the frequency of reuse of physicianprescribed antibiotics was high.
There was a significant association between self-medication and educational level but not with age, sex, martial status, occupation and type of insurance.
Better public knowledge and information about storage and risks of reuse of prescription medications is needed.


Abstract
Use of complementary and alternative medicine among midlife Arab women living in Qatar.
The prevalence of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread and is growing worldwide.
This cross-sectional study in Qatar examined the use of CAM and its correlates among Arab women in their midlife years.
Women aged 40-60 years (n = 814) were recruited at primary care centres in Qatar and completed a specially designed, pre-tested questionnaire.
Overall, 38.2% of midlife women in Qatar had used CAM in the previous 12 months.
Nutritional remedies and herbal remedies were the most commonly used CAM therapies, followed by physical methods.
Qatari nationality and higher level of education were independently associated with CAM use.
Menopause transition status was not independently associated with use of CAM.
The prevalence of CAM use by women in Qatar was high, consistent with other reports worldwide.
It is essential to educate and inform patients and health-care providers about the benefits and limitations associated with CAM.


Abstract
Knowledge of periconceptional folic acid use among pregnant women at Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.
Egypt has a high incidence of neural tube defects.
Folic acid supplementation in the periconceptional period is known to lower the risk of such defects.
This cross-sectional study aimed to measure the level of knowledge about periconceptional folic acid use among pregnant women attending for antenatal care at Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt in 2012.
Questionnaires were filled through personal interviews with 660 pregnant women.
Of the respondents, 62.4% had heard of folic acid and 39.2% knew about the role of folic acid supplementation in prevention of congenital anomalies.
Knowledge about using folic acid before and in the first trimester of pregnancy was highest among university-educated women and those working in professional occupations.
Only 18.8% of women reported taking folic acid, and 8.8% had used it before conception.

Abstract
Factors affecting the process of obtaining informed consent to surgery among patients and relatives in a developing country: results from Pakistan.
Efforts have been made in Pakistan to create ethical guidelines for research and medical practice.
This study explored the perceptions of and factors affecting the process of obtaining informed consent to surgery among inpatients and families at a tertiary-care hospital in Karachi.
A random sample of 400 post-surgery adult patients answered a pre-tested, structured questionnaire.
Overall, 233 patients (58.3%) had signed the surgery consent form themselves, while 167 relatives (41.7%) had signed on behalf of the patient.
Perceived factors significantly associated with patients not signing the consent form themselves were: language used (adjusted OR = 4.6), medical terminology used (aOR = 2.7), insufficient time allocation (aOR = 3.8), cultural/traditional reasons (aOR = 1.5) and low education (aOR = 2.4).
Inappropriate timing for taking consent and not being informed/asked about consent were not statistically significant factors.
Health-care practitioners should encourage patients to sign the consent form themselves.


Abstract
Interobserver variations in reporting of prostatic adenocarcinoma using core biopsy specimens: a retrospective study from a tertiary referral hospital in Saudi Arabia.
There was considerable interobserver agreement between the pathologists, with unweighted kappa scores ranging from 0.69-0.85.
We would encourage other hospital pathologists to review periodically the uniformity of diagnoses in an attempt to improve their practices in prostate gland pathology.


Abstract
Beside the individual handicap, fecal incontinence has a huge socio-economic impact.
Causes of fecal incontinence are changes in the quantity or quality of the stool and structural or functional disorders.
Diagnostic s encompass the medical history, clinical examination including the digital rectal examination, imaging (particularly endoanal ultrasound) as well as functional diagnostics (anal manometry and defecography).
Nowadays, the most promising conservative treatment option consists of loperamide and biofeedback therapy.
The most successful invasive method is the sacral neuromodulation.

Abstract
Herds were included if a positive result of polymerase chain reaction for PRRSV at the Animal Health Laboratory at the University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, was found between September 2004 and August 2007.
Nucleotide-sequence similarity and clinical similarity, as determined from a telephone survey, were calculated for all pairs of herds.
The Mantel test indicated that clinical similarity and sequence similarity were weakly correlated for most clinical signs.
The generalized additive model indicated that virus homology with 2 vaccine viruses affected the association between sequence similarity and clinical similarity.
When the data for herds with vaccine-like virus were removed from the dataset there was a significant association between virus similarity and similarity of the reported presence of abortion, stillbirth, preweaning mortality, and sow/boar mortality.
Ownership similarity was also found to be associated with virus similarity and with similarity of the reported presence of sows being off-feed, nursery respiratory disease, nursery mortality, finisher respiratory disease, and finisher mortality.
These results indicate that clinical signs of PRRS are associated with PRRSV genotype and that herd ownership is associated with both of these.


Abstract
In Ontario, the proportion of scrapie-resistant sheep increased from 2005 to 2012 as evidenced by an increase in the ARR haplotype.
When Canadian provinces (Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia) were compared from 2008 to 2012, a high proportion of scrapie-resistant sheep was found in all the provinces.
The proportions of resistant sheep were lower in Alberta and Quebec than in Ontario and Nova Scotia.
Alberta had higher proportions of susceptible sheep and a higher frequency of VRQ alleles, and Quebec had a higher frequency of the ARQ allele.

Both drugs were effective against CDV in vitro.


Abstract
This study aimed to investigate and compare the antagonistic effects of atipamezole, yohimbine, and prazosin on xylazine-induced diuresis in clinically normal cats.
Five cats were repeatedly used in each of the 9 groups.
One group was not medicated.
Cats in the other groups received 2 mg/kg BW xylazine intramuscularly, and saline (as the control); 160 μg/kg BW prazosin; or 40, 160, or 480 μg/kg BW atipamezole or yohimbine intravenously 0.5 h later.
Both atipamezole and yohimbine antagonized xylazine-induced diuresis, but prazosin did not.
The antidiuretic effect of atipamezole was more potent than that of yohimbine but not dose-dependent, in contrast to the effect of yohimbine at the tested doses.
Both atipamezole and yohimbine reversed xylazine-induced decreases in both urine specific gravity and osmolality, and the increase in free water clearance.
Glomerular filtration rate, osmolar clearance, and plasma electrolyte concentrations were not significantly altered.


Abstract
The aim of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetic disposition of levamisole (LVM)-oxyclozanide (OXZ) combination in sheep and goats following per os administration.


Abstract
Trends and future projections of the prevalence of adult obesity in Saudi Arabia, 1992-2022.
The prevalence of obesity among adults in Saudi Arabia increased from 22% in 1990-1993 to 36% in 2005, and future projections of the prevalence of adult obesity are needed by health policy-makers.
In a secondary analysis of published data, a number of assumptions were applied to estimate the trends and projections in the age-and sex-specific prevalence of adult obesity in Saudi Arabia over the period 1992-2022.
Five studies conducted between 1989 and 2005 were eligible for inclusion, using body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2) to define obesity.
The overall prevalence of obesity was projected to increase from around 12% in 1992 to 41% by 2022 in men, and from 21% to 78% in women.
Effective national strategies are needed to reduce or halt the projected rise in obesity prevalence.


Abstract
Assessment of physical inactivity and perceived barriers to physical activity among health college students, south-western Saudi Arabia.
Physical inactivity is a public health problem in Saudi Arabia.
A total of 1257 students (426 males and 831 females) were recruited.
The Arabic short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used.
Overall, 58.0% of the students were physically inactive.
Only 13.4% of the students performed vigorous physical activity, 14.8% moderate-intensity physical activity and 29.9% walking activities which met World Health Organization criteria of health-enhancing physical activities.
The prevalence of inactive leisure time was 47.5%.
The independent predictors of physical inactivity were non-membership of sports clubs and being a medical student.
The top reported barrier to physical activity among inactive students was time limitations (51.3%).
Overcoming perceived barriers may increase physical activity among students.


Abstract
Seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis B and C virus infection in Damietta Governorate, Egypt.
Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections remain major public health problems in Egypt and data are needed on risk factors for infection.
A household, cross-sectional study was conducted of 2977 individuals.
There is a need to educate the general population about HBV and HCV transmission routes and avoidance of risky behaviours.


Abstract
Knowledge, attitudes and intended behaviours towards HIV testing and self-protection: a survey of Omani pregnant women.
Mother-to-child transmission was recognized by 86.6% of the women but only 21.0% knew that it was preventable and a few acknowledged the important role of antiviral drugs.
Half of the women (51.9%) reported having been tested for HIV and 75.8% agreed about routine HIV testing for all pregnant women.
The results are discussed in relation to opt-in and opt-out approaches to voluntary testing during pregnancy.


Abstract
Seroprevalence of pertussis antibodies in 6-17-year-old students in Ahvaz, south-west Islamic Republic of Iran.
Although pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infection, vaccine-induced immunity is not lifelong and booster doses are recommended according to national disease epidemiology.
The aim of this study was to evaluate pertussis-IgG levels in school-aged students in Ahvaz, south-west Islamic Republic of Iran.
In a descriptive, cross-sectional study, blood samples were obtained from 640 students (382 boys and 258 girls) aged 6-17 years during 2010-2011.
All students had received a full course of pertussis whole-cell vaccination at ages 2, 4, 6 and 18 months and 4-6 years.
Using a Bordetella IgG ELISA kit, pertussis-IgG was detected in 301 (47.0%) students.
No statistically significant differences in pertussis-IgG levels were found between girls and boys or across different age groups.
The findings show that the overall level of pertussis-IgG seropositivity was unacceptable.
Booster vaccination with an acellular pertussis vaccine should be considered in adolescents and/or adults in our region.


Abstract
[Anti-tetanus immunity among university students and health staff in North Lebanon and administration of anti-tetanus serums in two hospitals].
Tetanus is a serious illness that kills about one million people a year globally.
This study aimed to i) evaluate immunity against tetanus (by antibodies titres in blood) among health staff and students at the Public Health Faculty, Lebanese University, ii) explore the determinants of the anti-tetanus immunity by a questionnaire and iii) estimate anti-tetanic serum use in the emergency departments of two hospitals (1 private, 1 public) in Tripoli.
Most of the participants (76.6%) had anti-tetanus antibody titres ≥ 0.1 UI/mL.
There was no association between immune status and gender (P = 0.614) but more participants ≤ 25 years were immunized than those > 25 years (P < 0.001) and more students were immunized than employees (P = 0.032).
There was an inverse association between anti-tetanus immunity and having visited a physician in the past year (P = 0.009).
In 2011, 1037 people received anti-tetanus immunoglobulins at the hospitals, 73% at the private hospital.
Vaccination campaigns targetting adults > 25 years may be warranted to assure good anti-tetanus protection and avoid administration of anti-tetanus immunoglobulins in emergency departments.


Abstract
Relationship between nurses' and physicians' perceptions of organizational health and quality of patient care.
This study investigated the relationship between nurses' and physicians' perceptions of the organizational health of a hospital and the quality of patient care.
Data were collected using 2 self-report questionnaires from 75 nurses and 49 physicians working in 4 intensive care units in a university-affiliated hospital in Saudi Arabia.
In the Quality of Patient Care questionnaire (7 domains) quality results was the highest scoring predictor [69.7 (SD 14.3)].
There was a significant positive correlation between participants' perception of overall mean percentage scores on the determinants of organizational hospital health and the predictors of the quality of patient care (r = 0.26).
In contrast, patient-centred care had no significant positive correlation with any of the studied hospital health determinants.


Abstract
Injuries and violence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: a review of the health, economic and social burden.
We review current literature and data on the burden of injury and violence in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the World Health Organization (WHO), with a special focus on the health, economic and social burden they impose on individuals, families and society.
In particular, road traffic injuries, the leading cause of injuries, account for 27% of the total injury and violence mortality in EMR according to WHO.


Abstract
Making use of 11 cell culture supernatants of different EAV isolates and 7 semen samples of positive stallions, the suitability of the techniques could be shown.
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the newly analysed samples compared with known sequences indicated that more EAV-lineages exist than presently described.


Abstract
While genetic factors play a role in the etiology of disorders such as depression, addiction, and schizophrenia, relatively high rates of discordance among identical twins clearly point to the importance of additional factors.
Environmental factors, such as stress, play a major role in the psychiatric disorders by inducing stable changes in gene expression, neural circuit function, and ultimately behavior.
Insults at the developmental stage and in adulthood appear to induce distinct maladaptations.
Increasing evidence indicates that these sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions.
Indeed, transcriptional dysregulation and associated aberrant epigenetic regulation is a unifying theme in psychiatric disorders.
Understanding how environmental factors recruit the epigenetic machinery in animal models is providing new insights into disease mechanisms in humans.


Abstract
Epidemiological studies suggest that gestational exposures to environmental factors including stress are strongly associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders.
Both maternal and paternal life experiences with stress can be passed on to offspring directly during pregnancy or through epigenetic marks in the germ cell.
Animal models of parental stress have examined relevant offspring phenotypes and transgenerational outcomes, and provided unique insight into the germ cell epigenetic changes associated with disruptions in neurodevelopment.
Understanding germline susceptibility to exogenous signals during stress exposure and the identification of the types of epigenetic marks is critical for defining mechanisms underlying disease risk.


Abstract
Obesity is now epidemic worldwide.
Beyond associated diseases such as diabetes, obesity is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression.
We review the evidence that programming of brain and behavior by perinatal diet is propagated by inflammatory mechanisms, as obesity and high-fat diets are independently associated with exaggerated systemic levels of inflammatory mediators.
Due to the recognized dual role of these immune molecules (eg, interleukin [IL]-6, 11-1β) in placental function and brain development, any disruption of their delicate balance with growth factors or neurotransmitters (eg, serotonin) by inflammation early in life can permanently alter the trajectory of fetal brain development.
Finally, epigenetic regulation of inflammatory pathways is a likely candidate for persistent changes in metabolic and brain function as a consequence of the perinatal environment.


Abstract
We also address the challenges for future studies, including that of the translation of epigenetic studies towards improvements in treatments.


Abstract
Drug addiction is characterized by uncontrolled drug consumption and high rates of relapse to drug taking during periods of attempted abstinence.
Addiction is now largely considered a disorder of experience-dependent neuroplasticity, driven by remodeling of synapses in reward and motivation relevant brain circuits in response to a history of prolonged drug intake.
Alterations in gene expression play a central role in addiction-relevant neuroplasticity, but the mechanisms by which additive drugs remodel brain motivation circuits remains unclear.
Here, the role for miRNAs in regulating basic aspects of neuronal function is reviewed.


Abstract
Cellular processes that control transcription of genetic information are critical for cellular function, and are often implicated in psychiatric and neurological disease states.
Among the most critical of these processes are epigenetic mechanisms, which serve to link the cellular environment with genomic material.
In addition to allowing site-specific epigenetic editing, these tools can be paired with optogenetic approaches to provide temporal control over epigenetic processes, allowing unparalleled insight into the function of these mechanisms.
This improved control promises to revolutionize our understanding of epigenetic modifications in human health and disease states.


Abstract
Dynamic regulation of chromatin structure in postmitotic neurons plays an important role in learning and memory.


Abstract
Early-onset, familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rare and may be attributed to disease-causinq mutations.
By contrast, late onset, sporadic (non-Mendelian) AD is far more prevalent and reflects the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, together with the disruption of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression.
Accordingly, abnormal patterns of histone acetylation and methylation, as well as anomalies in global and promoter-specific DNA methylation, have been documented in AD patients, together with a deregulation of noncoding RNA.
In transgenic mouse models for AD, epigenetic dysfunction is likewise apparent in cerebral tissue, and it has been directly linked to cognitive and behavioral deficits in functional studies.
Reciprocally, DNA methylation, histone marks and the levels of diverse species of microRNA are modulated by Aβ42, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.
In conclusion, epigenetic mechanisms are broadly deregulated in AD mainly upstream, but also downstream, of key pathophysiological processes.
While some epigenetic shifts oppose the evolution of AD, most appear to drive its progression.
Epigenetic changes are of irrefutable importance for AD, but they await further elucidation from the perspectives of pathogenesis, biomarkers and potential treatment.


Abstract
In addition, studies in animal models are providing a rapidly increasing list of chromatin-regulatory mechanisms with significant effects on cognition and complex behaviors, thereby pointing to the therapeutic potential of epigenetic drug targets in the nervous system.


Abstract
This downregulation is associated with the enrichment of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine proximally at gene regulatory domains at the respective genes.
Studies in mouse models of SZ indicate that clozapine induces DNA demethylation at relevant promoters, and that this action is potentiated by VPA.
By activating DNA demethylation, clozapine or its derivatives with VPA or other more potent and selective HDAC inhibitors may be a promising treatment strategy to correct the gene expression deficits detected in postmortem brain of SZ and BPD patients.


Abstract
Clinical studies find that childhood adversity and stressful life events in adulthood increase the risk for major depression and for suicide.
The predispositions to either major depression or suicide are thought to depend on genetic risk factors or epigenetic effects.
We investigated DNA methylation signatures postmortem in brains of suicides with diagnosis of major depressive disorder.
DNA methylation levels were determined at single C-phosphate-G (CpG) resolution sites within ventral prefrontal cortex of 53 suicides and nonpsychiatric controls, aged 16 to 89 years.
We found that DNA methylation increases throughout the lifespan.
This increased DNA methylation may be a significant contributor to the neuropathology and psychopathology underlying the risk of suicide in depression.


Abstract
Antimicrobial stewardship is a recent concept that embodies the practical, judicious use of antimicrobials to decrease adverse outcomes from antimicrobials while optimizing the treatment of bacterial infections to reduce the emergence of resistant pathogens.
The objectives of the present statement are to illustrate the principles of antimicrobial stewardship and to offer practical examples of how to make antimicrobial stewardship part of everyday hospital and outpatient practice.
Other specific, important actions include questioning whether positive urine cultures are contaminated when there is no evidence of pyuria or inflammatory changes, and obtaining a chest radiograph to support a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia.
Optimizing the choice and dosage of antimicrobials also reduces the probability of clinical failures and subsequent courses of antimicrobials.
A list of common clinical scenarios to promote stewardship is included.

Abstract
Although India is considered to be the country with the greatest tuberculosis burden, estimates of the disease's incidence, prevalence and mortality in India rely on sparse data with substantial uncertainty.
The relevant available data are less reliable than those from countries that have recently improved systems for case reporting or recently invested in national surveys of tuberculosis prevalence.
We explored ways to improve the estimation of the tuberculosis burden in India.
We focused on case notification data - among the most reliable data available - and ways to investigate the associated level of underreporting, as well as the need for a national tuberculosis prevalence survey.
We discuss several recent developments - i.e. changes in national policies relating to tuberculosis, World Health Organization guidelines for the investigation of the disease, and a rapid diagnostic test - that should improve data collection for the estimation of the tuberculosis burden in India and elsewhere.


Abstract
The Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation, which was built in response to World Health Assembly resolution WHA57.18, has conducted ongoing documentation of global transplantation activities since 2007.
In this paper, we use the Global Observatory's data to describe the current distribution of - and trends in - transplantation activities and to evaluate the role of health systems factors and macroeconomics in the diffusion of transplantation technology.
We then consider the implications of our results for health policies relating to organ donation and transplantation.
Of the World Health Organization's Member States, most now engage in organ transplantation and more than a third performed deceased donor transplantation in 2011.
In general, the Member States that engage in organ transplantation have greater access to physician services and greater total health spending per capita than the Member States where organ transplantation is not performed.
The provision of deceased donor transplantation was closely associated with high levels of gross national income per capita.
There are several ways in which governments can support the ethical development of organ donation and transplantation programmes.
Specifically, they can ensure that appropriate legislation, regulation and oversight are in place, and monitor donation and transplantation activities, practices and outcomes.
Moreover, they can allocate resources towards the training of specialist physicians, surgeons and transplant coordinators, and implement a professional donor-procurement network.


Abstract
The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) came into force for all Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2007 and the deadline for achieving compliance was June 2012.
The purpose of the IHR is to prevent, protect against, control - and provide a public health response to - international spread of disease.
The territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and that of several other Member States, such as China, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the United States of America, include overseas territories, which cover a total population of approximately 15 million people.
Member States have a responsibility to ensure that all parts of their territory comply with the IHR.
Since WHO has not provided specific guidance on compliance in the special circumstances of the overseas territories of Member States, compliance by these territories is an issue for self-assessment by Member States themselves.
To date, no reports have been published on the assessment of IHR compliance in countries with overseas territories.
We describe a gap analysis done in the United Kingdom to assess IHR compliance of its overseas territories.
The findings and conclusions are broadly applicable to other countries with overseas territories which may have yet to assess their compliance with the IHR.
Such assessments are needed to ensure compliance across all parts of a Member States' territory and to increase global health security.

Abstract
For thousands of years, cocoa have been a very popular food and has been linked to various beneficial health effects.
Observation al and epidemiological studies point towards a beneficial effect of dark chocolate on cardiovascular morbidity.
Several small, albeit controlled studies indeed demonstrate an amelioration of endothelial dysfunction - the dysfunction of the inner layer of the vessels - after intake of dark, flavanol-rich chocolate.
This is important, as endothelial dysfunction is an important marker of the development of atherosclerosis and an important prognosticator of future cardiovascular events.
This article summarizes the actual literature in this respect.

Abstract
Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for admission to hospital in the first year of life.
There is tremendous variation in the clinical management of this condition across Canada and around the world, including significant use of unnecessary tests and ineffective therapies.
This statement pertains to generally healthy children ≤2 years of age with bronchiolitis.
The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is based primarily on the history of illness and physical examination findings.
Laboratory investigations are generally unhelpful.
Bronchiolitis is a self-limiting disease, usually managed with supportive care at home.
Groups at high risk for severe disease are described and guidelines for admission to hospital are presented.
Evidence for the efficacy of various therapies is discussed and recommendations are made for management.
Monitoring requirements and discharge readiness from hospital are also discussed.

Severe complications in total hip replacement comprise dislocation, aseptic loosening, infection, periprosthetic fracture and limping.
A referral to the orthopaedic specialist should be considered early.


Abstract
Cerebral cavernomatous malformations (CCM) are a subgroup of low-pressure cerebral vascular malformation.
They have an estimated prevalence of 0,1-4% of the population and account for 8-15% of all cerebral vascular malformations.
The decision-making in patients with CCM can be classified into four categories: surgical or conservative treatment of symptomatic or incidental lesions.
Therefore, careful patient selection and appropriate experience of the centre is warranted in the management of CCM.

Abstract
The aim of this study was to compare two methods of early pregnancy diagnosis by determining pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) concentration in blood and PAG concentration in milk.
Blood and milk samples were obtained on days 0 (AI day), 14, 21, 28, 35, 49, 63, 77, 91 and 105 of gestation from 60 lactating Holstein Frisian cows from one herd, carrying live fetuses.
To determine PAG concentration a specific RIA system (RIA-706) was used.
PAG concentration in blood and milk increased after 28 days of pregnancy, with blood concentrations being significantly higher than in milk.
However, the accuracy of both tests at this time point was similar (sensitivity: 92 % in blood, 93 % in milk; specificity 53 % and 60 % respectively).
None of the tests were able to detect open cows properly at this stage.
The accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for PAG concentrations in blood and milk for the rest of the study was 100 %.
Our investigation shows that PAG determination in milk is a stress-free and non-invasive method for early pregnancy diagnosis in cattle.


Abstract
Currently, there is no consensus regarding how to determine the optimal surgical procedure for a patient with velopharyngeal incompetence (VPI) post-primary palate repair.
The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of preoperative velar closing ratio (VCR) and lateral wall movement (LWM) on nasal emission and hypernasality after Furlow double-opposing Z-plasty.
A retrospective analysis involving patients with VPI post-primary palatoplasty whose VPI was treated with double-opposing Z-plasty by a single surgeon was performed.
Ten consecutive patients with VPI postpalatoplasty were reviewed.
Videonasendoscopy, videofluoroscopy and perceptual speech examinations were performed preoperatively and postoperatively.
VCR improved from an mean of 0.5 preoperatively (range 0.1 to 0.95) to 0.9 postoperatively (range 0.55 to 1.0).
Postoperative mean LWM was 0.5 (range 0.3 to 0.9), unchanged from preoperative ratings.
A trend toward an inverse relationship between preoperative VCR and improvement in hypernasality and resolution of nasal emission was observed.
No relationship was noted between the degree of preoperative LWM and mean improvement in hypernasality.
However, patients with worse preoperative LWM experienced better resolution of nasal emission postoperatively.

Abstract
Meniscal allograft transplantation (MAT) is a relatively new procedure that has gained popularity in the last couple of decades as a possible alternative to a meniscectomy to provide significant pain relief, improve function, and prevent the early onset of degenerative joint disease (DJD).
As of present, evidence is limited and conflicting on the success of such procedures.
Following multiple procedures, including repair of both menisci and follow-up partial meniscectomy of the lateral meniscus, the patient continued to experience symptoms on the left lateral knee, making him a candidate for MAT.
This case is used to highlight what a MAT is, what makes someone a candidate for this type of procedure, the current evidence surrounding the success of this intervention, and some rehabilitation considerations following surgery.
The role of chiropractors and primary clinicians is to ensure that young athletes undergo early intervention to offset any degenerative changes that would be associated with sustained meniscal lesions.

Abstract
Invasive fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in patients with concomitant underlying immunosuppressive diseases.
The recent addition of new triazoles to the antifungal armamentarium has allowed for extended-spectrum activity and flexibility of administration.
Over the years, clinical use has raised concerns about the degree of drug exposure following standard approved drug dosing, questioning the need for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
Accordingly, the present guidelines focus on TDM of triazole antifungal agents.


Abstract
Confidentiality, informed consent and children's participation in the Saudi biobank governance: a comparative study.
The growth of research biobanks has created many new ethical challenges worldwide.
This article outlines and discusses key issues in the governance of Saudi Biobank, a newly established national biobank in Saudi Arabia launched in 2014.
The Saudi Biobank project includes human biological samples from participants aged 10-70 years and aims to conduct an extensive study on the influence of genes, environment and lifestyle in common diseases.
We examined the strengths and weaknesses of Saudi Biobank's governance as well as the similarities and differences with 4 other biobanks (in the United Kingdom, Iceland, Estonia and Canada).
Three different ethical issues are discussed in detail: confidentiality, informed consent and children's participation in research.
We evaluated these issues in relation to international ethical guidelines and Islamic law.
The insights gained may be useful in developing national biobanking regulations in other Islamic countries, particularly in countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region.


Abstract
Adjustment factors to per capita health-care indicators in countries with expatriate male-majority populations.
From 2000 to 2010, the population in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries underwent an increase of 53%, compared with an average global increase of 13%.
The rates varied by country, ranging from 23% in Oman to 198% in Qatar.
The main driving force for this sharp increase in population was the high demand for immigrant labour.
The aim of this study was to adjust the population in the GCC countries in order to ensure that the comparisons of health-care key performance indicators with other countries account for the composition of the populations.
Policy-makers can utilize the population models in this study to accurately plan for health-care delivery.


Abstract
Household food insecurity in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Using a systematic review of all available studies between 1991 and 2011, the prevalence of food insecurity in the Islamic Republic of Iran was estimated.
After document evaluation and data aggregation, studies were analysed in separate categories based on the methods used: dietary recall, household income/expenditure or experiential/perception-based surveys.
Meta-analysis of dietary-recall studies showed small non-significant increases between 1994 and 2004 in the prevalence of mild (from 8.8% to 9.3%) and moderate food insecurity (from 5.4% to 5.6%).
Severe food insecurity was 3.8% and 3.7% in 1994 and 2004 respectively.
Prevalence of food insecurity (moderate to severe) based on household income/expenditure surveys was consistently reported to be 10%.
A separate meta-analysis of experiential/perception-based studies revealed rates of mild, moderate and severe food insecurity of 28.6%, 14.9% and 6.0% respectively.
By combining study results in this manner makes it possible to come up with more realistic estimates for evidence-informed policy-making, until development of a national food insecurity surveillance system.

Adverse health effects of spousal violence among women attending Saudi Arabian primary health-care clinics.
This study aimed to investigate the frequency of spousal violence among Saudi women and document the related health effects and injuries, as well as their attitudes to gender and violence.
Structured interviews were conducted with 200 ever-married women recruited from primary-care centres in Jeddah.
Nearly half of the surveyed women (44.5%) reported ever experiencing physical violence from their spouse.
Victims of spousal violence had poor perceptions of their overall health, and reported pain or discomfort, antidepressant use and suicidal thoughts.
Women mostly disagreed with the presented justifications for wife-beating.
However, the association between gender attitudes and spousal violence was not significant.
The results of this study support calls for integration of education about partner violence into health-care curricula to enhance the access and quality of services.


Abstract
Prevalence of thalassaemia, iron-deficiency anaemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency among Arab migrating nomad children, southern Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study investigated the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and β-thalassaemia trait among Arab migrating nomad children in southern Islamic Republic of Iran.
Blood samples were analysed from 134 schoolchildren aged < 18 years (51 males, 83 females).
Low serum ferritin (< 12 ng/dL) was present in 17.9% of children (21.7% in females and 11.8% in males).
Low haemoglobin (Hb) correlated significantly with a low serum ferritin.
Only 1 child had G6PD deficiency.
A total of 9.7% of children had HbA2 ≥ 3.5 g/dL, indicating β-thalassaemia trait (10.8% in females and 7.8% in males).
Mean serum iron, serum ferritin and total iron binding capacity were similar in males and females.
Serum ferritin index was as accurate as Hb index in the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anaemia.
A high prevalence of β-thalassaemia trait was the major potential risk factor in this population.


Abstract
Oral health status of 12-year-old male schoolchildren in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
In a cross-sectional, analytical study 360 students participated from 4 boys' schools.
Dental caries, plaque, gingivitis, fluorosis and malocclusion were recorded using standard methods and indices.
The mean DMFT score was 1.53 (SD 1.88).
Caries prevalence was low (57.2%) but the mean SiC index was relatively high [3.63 (SD 1.66)].
Lower molars had the highest rate of caries.
Oral hygiene awareness programmes at schools, together with brushing and flossing programmes, are recommended in order to maintain and improve the oral health of young children in Medina.


Abstract
Pattern of beverage intake and milk and dairy products sufficiency among high-school students in Kuwait.
High consumption of soft drinks has been associated with lower intakes of milk and calcium-rich foods and higher body mass index (BMI).
This study aimed to explore the pattern of beverage intake among Kuwaiti high-school students.
A questionnaire on knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning beverages and milk and dairy products intake was completed by 190 Kuwaiti students aged 16-18 years and BMI was calculated for 181 of them.
Although BMI was not related to milk and dairy insufficiency, more of the overweight and obese students displayed incorrect practices.
Nutritional education of high-school students on the importance of milk and dairy products as well as the hazards of excess sweetened carbonated beverages and packaged juice is recommended to prevent the obesity epidemic prevailing in Kuwait.


Abstract
Tobacco use and associated factors among school students in Dubai, 2010: intervention study.
Tobacco smoking is an emerging problem among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Of the students, 14.6% were tobacco users, mostly cigarettes (11.2%) and waterpipes (2.2%).
There were significant improvements in knowledge and attitudes scores after the health education intervention programme.


Abstract
Role of smoke-free legislation on emergency department admissions for smoking-related diseases in Kocaeli, Turkey.
Legislation banning smoking in all indoor public places was introduced in Turkey in July 2009.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of smoke-free legislation on the number of emergency department admissions for smoking-related diseases in Kocaeli city.
A retrospective analysis was made of hospital records from the first 6 months of 2009 and 2010 (before and after legislation).
Total admissions for smoking-related diseases were 83 089 in 2009 and 64 314 in 2010, a 22.6% decrease.
Time-series analysis showed that the decreases were significant for bronchitis and lower respiratory tract infections.
Emergency admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction and allergic rhinitis were lower but not significantly so.
The number of patients admitted with asthma showed a non-significant increase.
Smoke-free legislation might have important short-term effects on emergency department admissions, but further studies are needed in order to evaluate the long-term effects of legislation on smoking-related diseases.


Abstract
Overall adequacy of antenatal care in Oman: secondary analysis of national reproductive health survey data, 2008.
Despite the good health status of women and children in Oman, there are still some gaps to be filled.
This study explored the adequacy of antenatal care (ANC) utilization of Omani ever-married women and the sociodemographic and health service determinants of adequate and sufficient ANC.
In a secondary analysis of a national dataset (N = 1852 women), the percentages of women who had 4+ ANC visits, attended ANC in the 1st trimester and received care by trained personnel were 96.8%, 74.9% and 99.1% respectively.
Overall adequacy of ANC (use and sufficiency of recommended basic services) for the surveyed women was 53.8%.
Greater awareness of the need for adequate ANC is required for mothers with more than one baby.

Perinatal health care in a conflict-affected setting: evaluation of health-care services and newborn outcomes at a regional medical centre in Iraq.
Improving birth outcomes in southern Iraq requires evidence-based clinical guidelines, additional supplies and equipment, quality improvement initiatives and in-service training.


Abstract
Experiences of stigma among hepatitis B and C patients in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan.
Hepatitis B and C are chronic diseases with mental and social impacts which can result in poor quality of life.
The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of stigma in a sample of hepatitis B- and C-positive patients in Pakistan.
In a cross-sectional study, 140 inpatients and outpatients from 3 tertiary-care hospitals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi answered a semi-structured questionnaire about stigma experienced from relatives, friends, spouse and health-care providers, and about work/financial problems.
The majority of patients (75%) said they had had to change their lifestyle, and significantly more were males than females.
Stigma was marked in terms of disease transmission, with 66% of patients fearing that they could transmit the infection to others; 19% said that family members avoided sharing towels, soap and eating and drinking utensils.
Marital relationships were affected for 51% of married patients who had told their spouse.
Patients ' comments showed a sense of family and societal discrimination resulting in feelings of disappointment and isolation.


Abstract
Typology and credibility of Internet health websites originating from Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The quality of information available on health websites in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries has not been comprehensively assessed.
From November to December 2012 we retrieved all functional health-related websites (n = 925) originating in GCC countries.
Data on authorship, language, date, information content and type of site were recorded.
A novel website checklist was developed based on the credibility and trust criteria of the Internet assessment organization Health On the Net Foundation (HON).
Only 5 sites (0.5%) fulfilled all checklist categories.
All websites except one were in English or Arabic languages.
Only 10.1% of websites posted a privacy policy, 2.7% stated the authorship of information, 51.0% disclosed website ownership, 80.6% provided contact details and 58.5% dated information.
Only 1.7% reported their advertising policy and 23.5% revealed sponsorships.
GCC health website owners should consider working with the HON or similar organizations to meet internationally recognized credibility criteria.


Abstract
Physicians' attitudes towards interaction with the pharmaceutical industry.
The relationship between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry has ethical implications for patient care.
This study examined knowledge and attitudes towards the pharmaceutical industry, and associations with actual behaviour, among physicians working in Saudi Arabia.
In a cross-sectional study in 2012, a 100-point score was created from 17 5-point Likert-scale questions to assess knowledge and attitudes.
The overall score of 659 participants was 63.1 (SD 8.5), with a majority holding a generally positive attitude.
Higher (i.e. better) scores were significantly associated with a lack of interactions with the pharmaceutical industry and with refusal of gifts but not with education about ethics.
In multivariate analysis, refusing gifts, additional income and Saudi nationality remained independently associated with higher scores.
Overall, there was suboptimal knowledge and a generally positive attitude towards the pharmaceutical industry among the sample of physicians in Saudi Arabia.


Abstract
Medical faculty members' perspectives on the components of cross-cultural competence in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a qualitative study.
Despite the importance of cultural competence in health care, there has been no research to develop a framework for cultural competence in the Iranian context.
This qualitative study at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences aimed to elucidate the views of medical faculty staff on the components of cross-cultural competence and compare these with similar studies published in English.
Participants expressed the importance of knowledge as a precursor to changing attitudes and the 6 knowledge components related to knowledge and awareness of values, beliefs and norms of different ethnic, racial and cultural groups.
Experts mostly emphasized the importance of interaction between faculty members and clients (students and patients).


Abstract
We describe here the medical risks and the many social, financial, and logistical considerations for travelling during pregnancy.


Abstract
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has become the leading cause of end-stage renal disease.
Important cornerstones of DKD therapy are an optimized glycaemic management as well as a good blood pressure control.
Although the prognosis of DKD has been improved in the last years, it is, even with novel therapy approaches, not possible to prevent the development of DKD.
It remains to hope that with extended knowledge, intensified preclinical studies and well-defined clinical trials novel nephroprotective therapies become available in the next years.


Abstract
Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) are used to monitor sensory function and are often recorded under general anesthesia.
The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of isoflurane on SSEPs in calves as it has not been reported.
Eight calves (mean age: 40 days), were included in the study.
Blood gas analysis was performed before each measurement.
SSEPs were recorded from the lumbo-sacral junction (s-SSEP) and the head (c-SSEP).
Latency and inter-amplitude of each peak were measured.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to develop a murine retinal/choroidal/scleral explant culture system to facilitate the intravitreous delivery of vectors.
Posterior segment explants from adult mice of 2 different age groups (4 wk and 15 wk) were cultured in serum-free medium for variable time periods.
Tissue viability was assessed by gross morphology, cell survival quantification, activated caspase-3 expression, and immunohistochemistry.
An age of donor mouse influence was noted and older mice did not transduce as well as younger mice.
This explant offers an easily managed posterior segment ocular culture with minimum disturbance of the tissue, and may be useful for investigating methods of enhancing retinal gene therapy under controlled conditions.


Abstract
Epidermal tight junctions (TJ) have been well-described in human medicine and are involved in many skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD).
In dogs, there are no data regarding the implication of TJ in skin diseases including canine AD.
The aim of this study was to compare the expression and the distribution of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 in the epidermis of healthy and atopic dogs.
Comparisons between groups were performed using an exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.
These results suggest a defect in claudin-1 expression in the nonlesional epidermis of atopic dogs.


Abstract
Sepsis is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in dogs.
Alterations in hemostasis by systemic inflammation play an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis.


Abstract
Three canine parainfluenza viruses type 5 (CPIV-5) were isolated from lung tissues of 3 Korean dogs with mild pneumonia between 2008 and 2009.
The isolates were fully sequenced and compared with published reference sequences.
The size of the genome was 15 246 nucleotides long and no remarkable differences were found when compared with previously published reference sequences.
In phylogenetic analysis based on the F and P genes, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5) strains were divided into at least 3 subgroups.
Three CPIV-5 strains were clustered with CPIV-5 T1, H22 and 78524 strains.
All PIV-5 strains were independent of the host species, geographical distribution, and the isolated period.


Abstract
Pain management at home for a patient, suffering from one or more advanced progressive diseases, goes beyond the prescription of an opioid.


Abstract
Palliative care and end of life at home remains a challenge for the general practitioner.
The success is related to many factors, including the situation of the patient, his social and family environment, the presence of the various health professionals and the physician's engagement.
The positive emotional impact on bereaved relatives after the end of life at home is often underestimated by the physician.


Abstract
Since children spend 30 to 35 hours per week at school, effectively managing their diabetes while there is integral to their short- and long-term health.
The Canadian Paediatric Society and the Canadian Pediatric Endocrine Group recommend that minimum standards for supervision and care be established across Canada to support children and youth with type 1 diabetes in schools.


Abstract
The results of three recent significant studies are examined, with focus on the efficacy of prophylaxis, and recommendations are made.


Abstract
Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major public heath problem world-wide, particularly in low-income countries.
Increased number of immunocompromised patients and immigration from countries where tuberculosis is endemic has resulted in increased number of cases in high-income countries.
Tuberculosis can affect any organ system, but is of particular interest to chiropractors when it affects the neuromusculoskeletal system.
Patients with tuberculosis of the neuromusculoskeletal system can present with mechanical low back pain or with complex neurologic deficits.
The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of considering a diagnosis of tuberculosis in susceptible populations and the devastating consequences of the disease.
The epidemiology, clinical features and management of tuberculosis will also be presented to facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate referral and multidisciplinary care of these patients.


Abstract
This case report describes the chiropractic management of a 30-year-old female patient with severe postpartum pelvic pain secondary to pubic symphysis diastasis.
No literature was found on the chiropractic management of postpartum symphysis pubis diastasis.
The existing literature concerning chiropractic care for symphysis pubis dysfunction during pregnancy is limited and indicates a potential benefit.
Separation of the pubic symphysis may include ligamentous injury to the sacroiliac joints and may lead to chronic pain.
Pubic symphysis separation of 17 millimeters was present on digital radiograph.
Pain was reduced from 8/10 VAS at the first visit to 2/10 at the fourth visit.
She was able to resume normal activities and reached a final pain level of 1/10.
The diastasis was reduced by 7 millimeters at 14-weeks post radiograph for a final separation of just under 10 millimeters.
Collaboration between obstetricians, midwives and chiropractors may be warranted.


Abstract
Many risk factors exist for falls in the elderly.
We also examine two related, but not mutually exclusive, mechanisms through which a putative beneficial effect may be mediated.
These are the effects of neck manipulation on neck pain and on non-specific dizziness.
We focus on the available evidence primarily in terms of clinical data rather than laboratory-based measures of balance.
We conclude that chiropractors may have a role in falls prevention strategies in the subpopulation of the elderly that suffer from mechanical neck pain or dysfunction and non-specific dizziness.
However, this role remains to be rigorously studied and properly defined.


Abstract
The purpose of this study is to document the topographic anatomy of an extensor indicis (EI) muscle with a double tendon and the associated distribution of the deep branch of the radial nerve (DBRN).
They then joined the medial slips of the extensor expansion of the second and third digits.
In all other dissected forearms, a tendon of the EI muscle joined the medial slip of the extensor expansion to the index finger.
The DBRN provided short branches to the superficial extensor muscles, long branches to the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis muscles, and terminated as the posterior interosseous nerve.
Understanding of the topographic anatomy of an EI with a double tendon, and the associated distribution of the DBRN, may contribute to accurate diagnosis and treatment of hand lesions.


Abstract
This review will consider the current state of the science in predicting treatment outcomes in psychiatry.
Genetic and other biomarkers will be considered alongside clinical diagnostic, and family history data.


Abstract
Computational analysis plays a pivotal role in integrating the various genome data and understanding the cellular response to a drug.
Based on that data, molecular models can be constructed that incorporate the known downstream effects of drug-targeted receptor molecules and that predict optimal therapy decisions.
In this article, we describe the different steps in the conceptual framework of computational modeling.
Finally, we illustrate this framework with selected studies related to the modeling of important target pathways affected by drugs.


Abstract
The use of neuroimaging approaches to identify likely treatment outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder is developing rapidly.


Abstract
The fact that, even when present, these brain alterations are subtle and distributed in nature, has limited, until now, the utility of MRI in the clinical management of these disorders.
More recently, MRI approaches, such as machine learning, have suggested that these neuroanatomical biomarkers can be used for direct clinical benefits.


Abstract
The search for clinical outcome predictors for schizophrenia is as old as the field of psychiatry.
However, despite a wealth of large, longitudinal studies into prognostic factors, only very few clinically useful outcome predictors have been identified.
The goal of future treatment is to either affect modifiable risk factors, or use nonmodifiable factors to parse patients into therapeutically meaningful subgroups.
Most clinical outcome predictors are nonspecific and/or nonmodifiable.
Nonmodifiable predictors for poor odds of remission include male sex, younger age at disease onset, poor premorbid adjustment, and severe baseline psychopathology.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a pleomorphic illness originating from gene x environment interactions.
Patients with differing symptom phenotypes receive the same diagnosis and similar treatment recommendations without regard to genomics, brain structure or function, or other physiologic or psychosocial factors.
Using this present approach, only one third of patients enter remission with the first medication prescribed, and patients may take longer than 1 year to enter remission with repeated trials.
Research to improve treatment effectiveness recently has focused on identification of intermediate phenotypes (IPs) that could parse the heterogeneous population of patients with MDD into subgroups with more homogeneous responses to treatment.
Such IPs could be used to develop biomarkers that could be applied clinically to match patients with the treatment that would be most likely to lead to remission.
Putative biomarkers include genetic polymorphisms, RNA and protein expression (transcriptome and proteome), neurotransmitter levels (metabolome), additional measures of signaling cascades, oscillatory synchrony, neuronal circuits and neural pathways (connectome), along with other possible physiologic measures.
Because of the highly integrative nature of brain systems and the complex neurobiology of depression, the most useful biomarkers are likely to be those with intermediate proximity both to the genome and the clinical phenotype of MDD.
Translation of findings across the spectrum from genotype to phenotype promises to better characterize the complex disruptions in signaling and neuroplasticity that accompany MDD, and ultimately to lead to greater understanding of the causes of depressive illness.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heterogeneous condition with a variable response to a wide range of treatments.
It is concluded that, although no method has yet been demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate to be applied in clinical practice, progress has been made.
It thus seems likely that--at some point in the not-too-distant future--it will be possible to prospectively identify, at least for some MDD patients, the likelihood of response or non-response to cognitive therapy or various antidepressant medications.


Abstract
In both clinical trials and daily practice, there can be substantial inter- and even intraindividual variability in response--whether beneficial or adverse--to antidepressants and antipsychotic medications.
This framework is flexible enough to be readily adaptable as new information becomes available.
The causes of variation in patient response are grouped into four categories: (i) genetics; (ii) age; (iii) disease; and (iv) environment (internal).
With the information gained, treatment can be adjusted to compensate for such variability, in order to optimize outcome.
Finally, the limitations of existing antidepressant and antipsychotic therapy and the way they reduce current ability to predict response is discussed.


Abstract
Antipsychotic medications are the gold-standard treatment for schizophrenia, and are often prescribed for other mental conditions.
Much of the interindividual variability in response and side effects is due to genetic factors (heritability, h(2)~ 0.60-0.80).


Abstract
Pharmacologic treatment targeting based on genomics of disease can be expected to increase greatly in the coming years.
In major psychiatric disorders and intellectual deficiency, rare and de novo deletion or duplication of chromosomal segments (copy number variation), in the aggregate, are common causes of increased risk.
This implies that the policy problems of pharmacogenomics will be particularly important for the psychiatric disorders.


Abstract
In comparison to palliative care in adults, the knowledge about palliative care in children is limited.


Abstract
Azoospermia in men requires microsurgical reconstruction or a procedure for sperm retrieval with assisted reproduction to allow fertility.
While the chance of successful retrieval of sperm in men with obstructive azoospermia approaches >90%, the chances of sperm retrieval in men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) are not as high.
Conventional procedures such as fine needle aspiration of the testis, testicular biopsy and testicular sperm extraction are successful in 20-45% of men with NOA.
With microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE), the chance of successful retrieval can be up to 60%.
Despite this increased success, the ability to counsel patients preoperatively on their probability of successful sperm retrieval has remained challenging.
The goal of this review was to evaluate the preoperative factors that are currently available to predict the outcome for success with micro-TESE.


Abstract
Studies have consistently reported a decrease in the use of antidepressants during pregnancy compared with the pre-pregnancy period.
The maternal risks of these medications are the focus of this review.
Untreated depression is associated with increased risks of maternal morbidity, both somatic and psychiatric.
In contrast, use of antidepressants has been associated with increased risks of hypertension, preeclampsia, and bleeding.
In this review we present the evidence for maternal risks in an attempt to develop a risk-benefit ratio.


Abstract
Chile, a middle-income country, recently joined Israel and Singapore as the world's only countries to require reciprocity as a precondition for organ transplantation.


Abstract
Over the last decade, a massive increase in data collection and analysis has occurred in many fields.
In the health sector, however, there has been relatively little progress in data analysis and application despite a rapid rise in data production.
In low- and middle-income countries in particular, the creation of an information feedback mechanism can move health-care delivery towards results-based practice and improve the effective use of scarce resources.
The collection of big data as mobile-phone based services improve may mean that development phases required elsewhere can be skipped.
However, poor infrastructure may prevent interoperability and the safe use of patient data.
An appropriate governance framework must be developed and enforced to protect individuals and ensure that health-care delivery is tailored to the characteristics and values of the target communities.


Abstract
Spermatozoa represent an immunologic challenge for the mammalian males.
In this review the focus will be on the immune status of the epididymis tubule, in which spermatozoa that have left the testes will mature for approximately 2 weeks and may be stored for prolonged period of time.


Abstract
During the haploid phase of spermatogenesis, spermatids undergo a complex remodeling of the paternal genome involving the finely orchestrated replacement of histones by the highly-basic protamines.
The associated striking change in DNA topology is characterized by a transient surge of both single- and double-stranded DNA breaks in the whole population of spermatids which are repaired before spermiation.
These transient DNA breaks are now considered part of the normal differentiation program of these cells.
Despite an increasing interest in the study of spermiogenesis in the last decade and the potential threat to the haploid genome, the origin of these DNA breaks still remains elusive.


Abstract
Two additional truncated transcripts were also detected by RT-PCR.
Indeed, previous works found that in the rat aromatase is expressed both in Sertoli and Leydig cells.
We propose to take into account this species difference as a new concept to better understand the changes in susceptibility to Endocrine Disruptors from one species to another.


Abstract
Spermatozoon is a cell with a precious message to deliver: the paternal DNA.
A variety of conditions such as infections of the male genital tract, varicocele, drugs, environmental factors, diseases, smoking, etc.
ROS-dependent damage targets proteins, lipids, and DNA, thus compromising sperm function and survival.
Elevated ROS in spermatozoa are associated with DNA damage and decreased motility.
Paradoxically, ROS, at very low levels, regulate sperm activation for fertilization.
Therefore, the regulation of redox signaling in the male reproductive tract is essential for fertility.
Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) play a central role in redox signaling being both antioxidant enzymes and modulators of ROS action and are essential for pathological and physiological events.
Recent studies from our lab emphasize the importance of PRDXs in the protection of spermatozoa as infertile men have significant low levels of PRDXs in semen and with little enzymatic activity available for ROS scavenging.
The relationships between sperm DNA damage, motility and lipid peroxidation and high levels of thiol-oxidized PRDXs suggest the enhanced susceptibility of spermatozoa to oxidative stress and further support the importance of PRDXs in human sperm physiology.
This review aims to characterize PRDXs, hidden players of the sperm antioxidant system and highlight the central role of PRDXs isoforms in the protection against oxidative stress to assure a proper function and DNA integrity of human spermatozoa.


Abstract
Penile Mondor's disease (PMD) is thrombophlebitis of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis.
It is usually considered as thrombophlebitis or phlebitis of subcutaneous vessels.
Some findings suggest that it might be of lymphatic origin.
The chest, abdominal wall, penis, upper arm, and other parts of the body may also be involved by the disease.
This disease almost always limits itself.
It may be associated with psychological distress and sexual incompatibility.
Diagnosis is usually easy with physical examination but color Doppler ultrasound examination is important for differential diagnosis.

Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IH (MPS IH) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.
Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been proposed for the treatment of MPS IH patients and offers the possibility to grow into their adulthood.
This patient benefited from testicular tissue cryopreservation before HSCT.
The Hurler syndrome may be responsible for the precocious initiation of spermatogenesis.
A specific follow-up during childhood may be useful to confirm if such abnormal testis development is common in young boys with MPS IH and if it may lead to precocious onset of puberty in survivors despite HSCT.


Abstract
In this paper, the well-established inhibiting effects of phthalates of the foetal Leydig cells function in the rat are briefly reviewed.
Then, data obtained in humans and other species are carefully analysed.
Already in January 2009, using the organotypic culture system named Fetal Testis Assay (FeTA) that we developed, we reported that phthalates might not affect testosterone production in human foetal testes.
Several recent experimental studies using xenografts confirm the absence of detectable anti-androgenic effect of phthalates in the human foetal testes.
Epidemiological studies led to contradictory results.
Altogether, these findings suggest that phthalates effects on foetal Leydig cells are largely species-specific.
More generally, the identification of common molecular, cellular or/and phenotypic targets in rat and human testes should precede the choice of the toxicological endpoint in rat to accurately assess the safety threshold of any ED in humans.


Abstract
This pathology is invalidating for the patient.

The initial priority areas for knowledge translation include improving optimal timing of dialysis initiation, and increasing the appropriate use of home dialysis.


Abstract
Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) are a polymorphic group of clinical disorders comprising the major cause of renal failure in children.
Genetic mouse models of impaired nephrogenesis and nephron endowment provide a critical framework for understanding the origins of human kidney disease.
Current methods to quantitate nephron number include (i) acid maceration (ii) estimation of nephron number from a small number of tissue sections (iii) imaging modalities such as MRI and (iv) the gold standard physical disector/fractionator method.
Despite its accuracy, the physical disector/fractionator method is rarely employed because it is labour-intensive, time-consuming and costly to perform.
Consequently, less rigourous methods of nephron estimation are routinely employed by many laboratories.
Here we present an updated, digitized version of the physical disector/fractionator method using free open source Fiji software, which we have termed the integrated disector method.
This updated version of the gold standard modality accurately, rapidly and cost-effectively quantitates nephron number in embryonic and post-natal mouse kidneys, and can be easily adapted for stereological measurements in other organ systems.


Abstract
Crusted scabies is a highly contagious form of scabies.
Altered immune response, nutritional deficiencies and modified host response are all risk factors for crusted scabies.
The authors report a case involving a patient found to have a chronic maculopapular, erythematous rash with large hyperkeratotic, white and grey plaques on the soles of both feet.
After topical permethrin was unsuccessful, intermittent dosing of oral ivermectin resulted in a rapid reduction in cutaneous plaques.


Abstract
Reports of fungal infection after total knee arthroplasty are extremely rare.
In most reports, the infecting organism is a Candida species.


Abstract
Despite universal access to screening for syphilis in all pregnant women in Canada, cases of congenital syphilis have been reported in recent years in areas experiencing a resurgence of infectious syphilis in heterosexual partnerships.
Serologic tests for syphilis remain important in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis and are complicated by the passive transfer of maternal antibodies which can affect the interpretation of reactive serologic tests in the infant.
All infants born to mothers with reactive syphilis tests should have nontreponemal tests (NTT) and treponemal tests (TT) performed in parallel with the mother's tests.
A fourfold or higher titre in the NTT in the infant at delivery is strongly suggestive of congenital infection but the absence of a fourfold or greater NTT titre does not exclude congenital infection.
IgM tests for syphilis are not currently available in Canada and are not recommended due to poor performance.


Abstract
In hard-to-reach populations, the benefits may outweigh the risks.
Available studies show reasonable performance of POCT with median sensitivity of 86%, specificity of 99% and positive predictive values >80% when prevalence was >0.3%.
Although no syphilis POCT are approved in Canada at this time, a single study in an outreach setting in Alberta showed limited benefit due to a high prevalence of previous infection but more studies are needed.
Newer dual tests employing treponemal and nontreponemal antigens look promising.


Abstract
Total hip arthroplasty (THA) has revolutionized the treatment of hip arthritis.
A number of surgical approaches to the hip joint exist, each with unique advantages and disadvantages.
The most commonly used approaches include the direct anterior, direct lateral and posterior approaches.
A number of technical intricacies allow safe and efficient femoral and acetabular reconstruction when using each approach.
Hip dislocation, abductor insufficiency, fracture and nerve injury are complications of THA, although their relative risk varies by approach.
Numerous clinical trials have sought to elicit differences in patient-reported outcomes, complication rates and return to function among the surgical approaches.
This review outlines some of the technical pearls of performing a THA through either a direct anterior, direct lateral or posterior approach.
A literature review outlines the impact of surgical approach on clinical outcomes and clinically relevant complication rates.


Abstract
The first differential diagnosis can often be carried out by a thorough medical history, in particular the medication intake.
Also, the first clinical and laboratory investigations can take place at the general practitioner's clinic.
If a serious condition is identified as the cause of hyperkalemia the patient should be referred to a specialized clinic.


Abstract
Hyponatremia is defined as a serum below 135 mmol/l and is the most frequent electrolytes disorder.
The treatment is essential because hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
The rate of correction of hyponatremia should be closely monitored to avoid cerebral complications.
This article reviews the recommended approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia.


Abstract
The treatment of hyperoxaluria involves reduction in oxalate intake and increase in calcium intake.


Abstract
A low-salt diet, namely 5 to 6 g/d, is useful to optimize the treatment of hypertension associated with CKD and to limit fluid overload.
At the advanced stage of CKD, it is also necessary to restrict the intake of phosphorus and sometimes potassium.
Given the complexity of optimal renal diet, coordination between general practitioners, nephrologists and dietitians is essential to foster optimal care.


Abstract
Congenital anomalies in Canada 2013: a perinatal health surveillance report by the Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System.
Congenital Anomalies in Canada 2013: A Perinatal Health Surveillance Report is the second national surveillance report from the Public Health Agency of Canada dedicated to congenital anomalies.
The report presents national-level birth prevalence data and temporal trends, provincial and territorial estimates, and international comparisons.
Known risk factors, prevalence-related impacts of prenatal diagnosis and preventative measures are also discussed.


Abstract
Perinatal health indicators 2013: a surveillance report by the Public Health Agency of Canada's Perinatal Surveillance System.
The Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System (CPSS) is a national health surveillance program of the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The CPSS mandate is to monitor and report on key indicators of maternal, fetal and infant health.
These indicators include both determinants and outcomes of perinatal health.
Perinatal Health Indicators 2013 reports on 13 priority indicators using the most recent data from vital statistics, hospitalizations, the Canadian Community Health Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth.

There are key differences between tuberculosis in children and adults.


Abstract
Food insecurity and hunger are significant problems in Canada, with millions of Canadians experiencing some level of food insecurity.
The purpose of the present article is to review what is currently known about the effects of food insecurity and hunger on children.
Longitudinal studies in Canada indicate that hunger is related to poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, and chronic conditions, particularly asthma.
In addition, nutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency, are known to impair learning and cause decreased productivity in school-age children, and maternal depressive disorders.
School-based nutrition programs and innovations, such as subsidized food (apples, cheese, soy nuts, carrots and broccoli), are an essential immediate need, but long-term solutions lie in adequate incomes for families.


Abstract
An electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) is a battery attached to a chamber containing liquid that may (or may not) contain nicotine.
The battery heats the liquid and converts it into a vapour, which is inhaled, mimicking tobacco smoking.
The e-cigarette does not rely on tobacco as a source of nicotine but, rather, vaporizes a liquid for inhalation.
The deleterious effects of nicotine on paediatric health are well established.
The use of e-cigarettes in the paediatric age group is on the rise in Canada, as are associated nicotine poisonings.
E-devices generate substantial amounts of fine particulate matter, toxins and heavy metals at levels that can exceed those observed for conventional cigarettes.
Children and youth are particularly susceptible to these atomized products.
Action must be taken before these devices become a more established public health hazard.
Policies to denormalize tobacco smoking in society and historic reductions in tobacco consumption may be undermined by this new 'gateway' product to nicotine dependency.


Abstract
Violent behaviour associated with alcohol consumption is frequently reported by different media.
Clinical data analysing the correlation between alcohol intoxication, age, gender and violence are scarce.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of age, gender and blood alcohol content on violent behaviour under the influence of alcohol under central European conditions.
Violence was defined as an evitable act committed by others leading to patient's hospitalisation.
The data were considered as significant if p<0,05.
Predictive quality was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
Independent predictors were analyzed by logistic regression analysis.
Logistic regression analysis revealed male gender and young age as an independent predictor for violence.


Abstract
Circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages were suggested to be susceptible to avian reovirus (ARV) infection.
To determine if ARV infects and replicates in mononuclear phagocytes (KUL01-positive cells), we infected 3-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens with ARV strain 2408 by inoculation of the left footpad.
The left footpads and spleens were collected for analysis at 1.5 and 2.5 d after inoculation.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to examine the effect of calving difficulty or dystocia on the vitality of newborn calves and its association with blood pH, the apparent efficiency of immunoglobulin G (IgG) absorption (AEA), and weight gain.
A total of 45 calving events (N = 48 calves) were monitored from the first sight of fetal membranes.
All calves were assessed at the time of first attaining sternal recumbency (SR), at 2 and 24 h, and at 7 and 14 d of age.
Measurements included time to SR, rectal temperature, respiration and heart rate, analysis of blood gases and other blood measures, suckling response, time to standing, passive transfer of IgG, and weight gain.
Calves were separated from their dam 2 h after birth and fed a commercial colostrum replacer containing 180 g of IgG by esophageal tube feeder.
Calves born following dystocia had lower venous blood pH and took longer to attain SR and attempt to stand than those born unassisted.
Duration of calving interacted with the number of people required to extract the calf by pulling as a significant predictor of pH at SR.
No association was found between pH at SR and AEA.
However, reduced AEA was found in calves that were female and in calves that did not achieve SR within 15 min of birth.


Abstract
Atopic dermatitis is a common allergic skin disease in dogs.
The study was conducted using 33 dogs with atopic dermatitis.


Abstract
Sequence comparison showed that the M2 gene had the most variability among the M-class genes of DRV.
Phylogenetic analysis of the M-class genes of ARV strains revealed different lineages and clusters within DRVs.
However, the MDRV and NDRV strains are closely related and located in a common lineage in the M1 and M3 gene trees, respectively.


Abstract
This study investigated whether changes in the vaginal electrical resistance (VER) of vaginal mucus of weaned sows during the first 7 d post-weaning are associated with time of ovulation.
Time of ovulation was determined by ovarian ultrasound carried out from 91 to 146 h after weaning and at different seasons.


Abstract
Seroprevalence of poliovirus antibodies among 7-month-old infants after 4 doses of oral polio vaccine in Sistan-va-Baluchestan, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Despite high coverage rates of polio vaccine in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the seroconversion rates of infants may be inadequate.
This study measured seroprevalence of antibodies against poliovirus serotypes 1 to 3 (PV1, PV2 and PV3) in 7-month-old infants who had received at least 4 doses of trivalent oral polio vaccine.
A serosurvey was conducted in 2010 in rural areas of Chabahar, Sistan-va-Baluchestan province.
Using cluster sampling, 72 eligible infants were tested for antibody against the 3 poliovirus serotypes according to WHO guidelines.
Antibody titres ≥ 1:10 were considered positive.
The seropositive rates for antibody against PV1, PV2 and PV3 were 84.7%, 95.8% and 70.8% respectively.
Only 63.9% of participants were seropositive for antibodies against all 3 poliovirus serotypes.
Except for PV2, the seroprevalence of antibody against the other 2 poliovirus serotypes, especially PV3, was unsatisfactory.


Abstract
Value and impact of international hospital accreditation: a case study from Jordan.
We assessed the economic impact of Joint Commission International hospital accreditation on 5 structural and outcome hospital performance measures in Jordan.
The net impact of accreditation was a 1.2 percentage point reduction in patients who returned to the ICU, 12.8% reduction in annual staff turnover and 20.0% improvement in the completeness of medical records.
Pooling both hospitals over 3 years, these improvements translated into total savings of US$ 593 000 in Jordan's health-care system.


Abstract
Use of clinical guidelines: perspectives from clinicians in paediatric and maternity hospitals in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Seven sets of guidelines, protocols or standards were identified (including 5 WHO-endorsed guidelines).
However, most are failing to achieve high levels of use.
Implementation activities should fulfil 3 major objectives: promote guideline awareness and access; stimulate motivation among clinical guideline users; and actively facilitate adherence to guidelines.


Abstract
Breast cancer screening programme: experience from Eastern province, Saudi Arabia.
Programmes for early diagnosis of breast cancer are lacking in most countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Annual screening was offered to all women aged 40 years and above.
The recall rate was 7.9%.
The number of cancers detected was 47, a cancer detection rate of 5.83 per 1000 women screened; 70.2% of the cancers detected had either no mass or the lesions were smaller than 2 cm.
The mean age of women with cancer was 50.4 (SD 7.6) years.
The screening parameters of our study correlated well with international standards.
Despite the controversies regarding universal breast cancer screening, a national breast cancer screening programme for Saudi Arabia is needed.


Abstract
Risky road-use behaviour among students at the University of Benha, Egypt.
Road traffic injuries constitute 45% of deaths due to injury in Egypt.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify and investigate risky behaviours regarding road use among university students in Benha.
A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 953 students.
In binary logistic regression analysis, substance use (OR 18.3; 95% CI: 9.10-23.3) and having peers with similar behaviours (OR 2.53; 96% CI: 1.15-5.55) were significant predictors of not following road traffic safety rules as a pedestrian.
Exceeding the legal traffic speed limits as a driver was significantly associated with male sex (OR 5.13; 95% CI: 1.98-13.3), peer pressure (OR 8.70; 95% CI: 3.90-17.1) and substance use (OR 3.30; 95% CI: 1.58-13.7).
Health education sessions and training courses for students on appropriate road behaviours may be warranted.


Abstract
Knowledge about hepatitis B vaccination among women of childbearing age: a cross-sectional study from a rural district of Punjab, Pakistan.
Pakistan is considered as an intermediate zone of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, with an estimated population prevalence of 2-7%.
This study assessed knowledge about HBV and vaccination among women of childbearing age in a rural setting of Punjab province, Pakistan.
In 2012 a cross-sectional, community-based survey of 430 women was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire.
Less than half of the women (43%) surveyed had correct knowledge about HBV vaccination, and knowledge was especially poor among the low socioeconomic groups.
Age, level of education and obstetric history of the respondents were significantly associated with knowledge about HBV and its vaccination.
The main sources of information regarding HBV vaccination were lady health workers (53%) and traditional birth attendants (22%).
Health promotion and behaviour change campaigns highlighting the importance of hepatitis B vaccine need to be designed to meet the needs of rural areas where women have little exposure to the mass media.


Abstract
Changes in antibiotic use in a general surgery unit over a 5-year period.
Concerns have been expressed about the overuse of antibiotics in inpatient settings.
We compared the pattern of antibiotic use in 2010 in a surgical unit of a university hospital in the Islamic Republic of Iran with similar data from 2006.
Defined daily doses per 100 bed-days (DBD) were calculated.
Overall use of antibiotics in our surgical unit increased significantly from a mean of 4.9 (SD 5.1) DBD in 2006 to 7.7 (SD 10.3) DBD in 2010.
There was an increase in the consumption of ceftriaxone, imipenem, cefalotin, metronidazole and vancomycin, a decrease in the use of erythromycin and ceftazidime and no change in the use of ciprofloxacin and clindamycin.


Abstract
Towards an electronic national injury surveillance system in Saudi Arabia.
A special form for this purpose was designed, modified from validated forms used elsewhere for injury surveillance.
This initiative of the Ministry of Health is also expected to help validate data collected by other sectors, such as the Ministry of Interior.


Abstract
The progress in genomic research has led to increased sampling and storage of biological samples in biobanks.
In addition, many countries may have inadequate legislative structures and governance frameworks to protect research participants and communities from unfair distribution of risks and benefits.
International collaborations are frequently being created to support the establishment and proper running of biobanks in low- and middle-income countries.
However, these collaborations cause cross-border issues – such as benefit sharing and data access.
It is thus necessary to define and implement a fair, equitable and feasible biobank governance framework to ensure a fair balance of risks and benefits among all stakeholders.

This mini-review summarizes selected and practically relevant diagnostic and therapeutic aspects from recent international guidelines.


Abstract
Incidence of acute myocardial infarction in Islamic Republic of Iran: a study using national registry data in 2012.
Population-based data on myocardial infarction rates in the Islamic Republic of Iran have not been reported on a national or provincial scale.
In a cross-sectional study, data were collected on 20 750 new cases of myocardial infarction (ICD10 codes I21-22) admitted to hospitals and registered by the Iranian Myocardial Infarction Registry in 2012.
The crude and age-adjusted incidence for the 31 provinces and the whole country were directly calculated per 100 000 people using the WHO standard population.
Overall, males comprised 72.4% of cases and had a significantly lower mean age at incidence than women [59.6 (SD 13.3) years versus 65.4 (SD 12.6) years].
The male:female incidence ratio was 2.63.
The age-standardized myocardial infarction incidence rate was 73.3 per 100 000 in the whole country (95% CI: 72.3%-74.3%) and varied significantly from 24.5 to 152.5 per 100 000 across the 31 provinces.
The study provides baseline data for monitoring and managing cardiovascular diseases in the country.


Abstract
Epidemiological and chronological profile of preterm birth in the region of Monastir (Tunisia) between 1994 and 2012.
Data about the profile and risk factors of premature births in Tunisia are scarce.
The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological profile of preterm births in Monastir, Tunisia, and to study the chronological trends of associated factors over the years 1994-2012.
A population-based study was conducted using data from the regional births database on all deliveries in public maternity units.
The overall prevalence of preterm births among the 161 116 deliveries in the 19-year period was 5.60% (95% CI: 5.13%-6.07%).
The rate of preterm births and of adequate prenatal care increased significantly over the study period.
Extremes of maternal age (≤ 19 and ≥ 35 years), having a twin pregnancy and the occurrence of complications during pregnancy were significant predictors of prematurity in the final regression model.
Efforts should be made to improve the quality of health care in the region, especially for high-risk pregnancies.


Abstract
This qualitative study aimed to identify the health-care problems of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2 large cities: Tehran and Kermanshah.
Two main groups of stakeholders - service providers (policy-makers, managers, physicians and counsellors) and service recipients (PLHIV and their relatives) - participated in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.
The problems and needs identified can inform the design and implementation of health programmes in our country and elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.


Abstract
Psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs Assessment Questionnaire.
No tools to assess women's general sexual and reproductive health needs have been validated in the Iranian context.
The Persian version of the questionnaire was found to have adequate face and content validity (quantitative and qualitative) for assessing sexual and reproductive health needs among women (content validity index = 0.88).
The test-retest reliability showed that, except for the domain of sexually transmitted infections, all domains of the questionnaire had an acceptable reliability (intra-class correlation coefficients > 0.5).
This questionnaire is a valid tool for assessing the sexual and reproductive health needs of Iranian women and planning/designing strategies to meet them.


Abstract
Herbal and nutritional supplement use among college students in Qatar.
There is increasing demand for herbal and nutritional supplements in the Middle East.
This study aimed to examine the use of supplements by college students in Qatar and to elucidate users' views about them.
A total of 419 college students completed a self-administered questionnaire.
Of the latter, 27.7% had used herbal supplements, 56.2% vitamins and minerals and 56.9% non-vitamin, non-mineral, non-herbal supplements.
Many participants considered supplements to be safer and more effective than conventional medicines.
Supplements were preferred over conventional medicines for the treatment of digestive conditions and common respiratory ailments and for weight management.
Educating health-care providers about the benefits and risks of supplements is imperative and will enable health-care practitioners to guide patients in making informed decisions about supplement use.


Abstract
Medical faculty members' perspectives on the components of cross-cultural competence in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a qualitative study.
Despite the importance of cultural competence in health care, there has been no research to develop a framework for cultural competence in the Iranian context.
This qualitative study at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences aimed to elucidate the views of medical faculty staff on the components of cross-cultural competence and compare these with similar studies published in English.
Participants expressed the importance of knowledge as a precursor to changing attitudes and the 6 knowledge components related to knowledge and awareness of values, beliefs and norms of different ethnic, racial and cultural groups.
Experts mostly emphasized the importance of interaction between faculty members and clients (students and patients).


Abstract
Risk factors influencing dentists' hepatitis B-related knowledge and attitudes and their willingness to treat hepatitis B positive patients.
A positive attitude was associated with having attended more courses and working in group practice.
The number of courses and a shorter dental unit preparation time positively affected dentists' behaviour.


Abstract
Development, implementation and evaluation of a medication safety programme for schoolchildren in Qatar.
The objectives of this study were to assess the needs of schoolchildren relating to medication safety and to develop and implement a health promotion programme in Qatar.
Semi-structured interviews were completed with teachers, nurses and school administrators at 2 primary schools in Doha.
Two main themes were identified from these interviews, namely medication basics and medication safety.
Subsequently, a 25-minute health promotion programme was developed and delivered to 11 groups of schoolchildren aged 6-10 years.
The student groups contained both expatriate and local Qatari students.
The programme was evaluated based on perceptions of site representatives, investigators and peer reviewers using a standardized evaluation form.
All the evaluators agreed that the programme was beneficial and should be recommended to other schools in Qatar.
This study can serve as a prototype for future programmes in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and elsewhere.

Abstract
The Canadian Society of Nephrology is expected to advise on the future of teaching procedural skills in nephrology.
There is no longer a compelling reason to mandate this for all trainees.


Abstract
Taking this debate as a point of departure this article discusses the current and future role of sociology in a globalised world.
It discusses how environmental sociology in the US and Europe differ in their understandings of sociology's contribution to the study of the environment.
Finally, the article proposes some new rules for a global environmental sociology and describes some of their possible implications for the sociological study of climate change.


Abstract
The concept of psychosis has been shaped by traditions in the concepts of mental disorders during the last 170 years.
The term "psychosis" still lacks a unified definition, but denotes a clinical construct composed of several symptoms.
Delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorders are the core clinical features.
To advance the elucidation of the causes and the pathophysiology of the symptoms of psychosis, a deconstruction of the term into its component symptoms is therefore warranted.
Current research is dealing with the delineation from "normality", the genetic underpinnings, and the causes and pathophysiology of the symptoms of psychosis.


Abstract
With his early publications (1910-1913), Karl Jaspers created a comprehensive methodological arsenal for psychiatry, thus laying the foundation for descriptive psychopathology.
Following Edmund Husserl, the founder of philosophical phenomenology, Jaspers introduced phenomenology into psychopathology as "static understanding," ie, the unprejudiced intuitive reproduction (Vergegenwärtigung) and description of conscious phenomena.
In a longitudinal perspective, "genetic understanding" based on empathy reveals how mental phenomena arise from mental phenomena.
Severance in understanding of, or alienation from, meaningful connections is seen as indicating illness or transition of a natural development into a somatic process.
Jaspers opted for philosophy early.
In the fourth and subsequent editions of his General Psychopathology, imbued by his existential philosophy, Jaspers partly abandoned the descriptive method.


Abstract
Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) was an influential figure in the history of psychiatry as a clinical science.
Throughout his professional life, Kraepelin put emphasis on establishing psychiatry as a clinical science with a strong empirical background.
He preferred pragmatic attitudes and arguments, thus underestimating the philosophical presuppositions of his work.
As for nosology, his central hypothesis is the existence and scientific accessibility of "natural disease entities" ("natürliche Krankheitseinheiten") in psychiatry.


Abstract
The introduction of the term and concept schizophrenia earned its inventor, Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, worldwide fame.


Abstract
This article reviews the role of the French schools in the development of psychiatric nosology.
Boissier de Sauvages published the first French treatise on medical nosology in 1763.
Until the 1880s, French schools held a pre-eminent position in the development of psychiatric concepts.
From the 1880s until World War I, German-speaking schools exerted the most influence, featuring the work of major figures such as Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler.
French schools were probably hampered by excessive administrative and cultural centralization.
Between the 1880s and the 1930s, French schools developed diagnostic categories that set them apart from international classifications.
The main examples are Bouffée Délirante, and the complex set of chronic delusional psychoses (CDPs), including chronic hallucinatory psychosis.
CDPs were distinguished from schizophrenia by the lack of cognitive deterioration during evolution.
Modern French psychiatry is now coming into line with international classification, such as DSM-5 and the upcoming ICD-11.


Abstract
The nosology of modern psychiatry began with the German classifiers of the late 19th century, especially Emil Kraepelin.
Psychoanalysis then blotted out the classificatory vision for the next half-century, and most of this European psychopathological science failed to cross the Atlantic.
The DSM series was a homegrown American product, beginning with Medical 203 in 1945, then guided by psychoanalytic insights through DSM-I in 1952 and DSM-II in 1968.


Abstract
Current taxonomic approaches in medicine and psychiatry are limited in validity and utility.
As the need for an information hub and a knowledge network with a dynamic taxonomy based on integration of clinical and research data is vital, and timely, this proposal merits consideration.


Abstract
In keeping with the NIMH mission, to "transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research," RDoC was explicitly conceived as a research-related initiative.
The statement of the relevant goal in the strategic plan reads: "Develop, for research purposes, new ways of classifying mental disorders based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures."
This review discusses the rationale for the experimental framework that RDoC has adopted, and its implications for the nosology of mental disorders in the future.


Abstract
Accountability is central to CBME, ensuring that graduating practitioners are well-rounded and competent to provide safe and effective patient care.
The structure of CBME in obstetrics and gynaecology must be rooted in, and reflect, Canadian practice.
Its development and implementation require an understanding of the principles that are the foundation of CBME, along with the involvement of the entire community of obstetricians and gynaecologists and other maternity care providers.
We provide here an overview of the basic principles of teaching and learning and the theories underpinning CBME.


Abstract
Subfertile men and women are usually cared for by different clinicians, namely urologists and gynaecologists.
While these doctors share each other's goals, they may not always appreciate the content or implications of their opposite number's clinical decisions; to some degree they may practice in "silos."
We address this problem by reviewing the effectiveness of medical treatments for male factor subfertility in the context of female factors.
However, data from randomized controlled trials suggest benefits from some treatments: clomiphene and tamoxifen for the male (common odds ratio for pregnancy [COR] 2.42; 95% CI 1.47 to 3.94), antioxidants (COR 4.18; 95% CI 2.65 to 6.59) and surgical management of a clinical varicocele (COR 2.39; 95% CI 1.56 to 3.66).
Making treatment decisions squarely in the context of the couple's overall prognosis is key for optimal outcomes.
Future trials of male fertility treatments should focus on pregnancy as the primary outcome, rather than less important surrogates such as sperm quality.


Abstract
Cancer incidence in Canada: trends and projections (1983-2032).
Each year, the Canadian Cancer Statistics publication provides an estimate of expected case counts and rates for common cancer sites for the current year in Canada as a whole and in the provinces and territories.
This monograph expands on the Canadian Cancer Statistics publication by providing historical and projected cancer incidence frequencies and rates at national and regional levels from 1983 to 2032.
The aim is that this monograph will be an important resource for health researchers and planners.


Abstract
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed disorders in children, yet it remains poorly understood.
Substantial controversy exists regarding correct diagnosis of ADHD, and areas of subjectivity in diagnosis have been identified.
Additionally, substantial variation exists in ADHD diagnosis between boys and girls, with boys often presenting with more stereotypical symptoms.
Both the relative-age effect and variation in sex diagnosis, as well as the challenges of early preschool diagnosis, emphasize the importance of considering relative maturity in ADHD diagnosis of children.
Implications and knowledge translation strategies for practitioners, parents and the education system are presented.


Abstract
The harmful effects of child poverty are well documented.
Despite this, progress in poverty reduction in Canada has been slow.
Establishment of a comprehensive national poverty reduction plan is essential to improving progress.
The present review identifies the key components of an effective poverty reduction strategy.
Specific economic interventions are also reviewed.
Addressing the social determinants of health in these ways is crucial to narrowing disparities in wealth and health so that all children in Canada reach their full potential.


Abstract
Ankyloglossia ('tongue-tie') is a relatively common congenital anomaly characterized by an abnormally short lingual frenulum, which may restrict tongue tip mobility.
There is considerable controversy regarding its diagnosis, clinical significance and management, and there is wide variation in practice in this regard.
Most infants with ankyloglossia are asymptomatic and do not exhibit feeding problems.
Based on available evidence, frenotomy cannot be recommended for all infants with ankyloglossia.
There may be an association between ankyloglossia and significant breastfeeding difficulties in some infants.
This subset of infants may benefit from frenotomy (the surgical division of the lingual frenulum).
More definitive recommendations regarding the management of tongue-tie in infants await clear diagnostic criteria and appropriately designed trials.


Abstract
The present statement defines nosodes and describes limitations for their use in children.


Abstract
Investigating the informed consent process, therapeutic misconception and motivations of Egyptian research participants: a qualitative pilot study.
Few studies have explored the informed consent process among research participants in developing countries.
This study aimed to evaluate the informed consent process, therapeutic misconception and motivation for participation among Egyptians participating in clinical trials.
In a cross-sectional qualitative pilot study 103 participants in 10 clinical trials responded to a questionnaire.
Over 90% agreed they had time to ask questions and received adequate information about the risks prior to consenting.
All participants thought the research and the drug would improve their condition; only 46.1% were aware of receiving a non-approved experimental drug and 21.3% of being randomized.
Investigators need to emphasize the distinction between research and clinical care to address the high rate of therapeutic misconception.


Abstract
Undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in rural communities in Sudan: prevalence and risk factors.
Undiagnosed diabetes constitutes a challenge for health providers, especially in rural areas.
The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and glucose intolerance among adults in rural communities in River Nile State, north Sudan.
In a cross-sectional community-based study, blood glucose, anthropometric, demographic and clinical history data were obtained from 1111 individuals from 35 villages.
The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 2.6% (29 individuals); glucose intolerance was detected in 1.3% (14 individuals).
Classic symptoms (polydipsia, polyuria and weight loss) were present in around half of the participants but were not more prevalent in those with diabetes.
Lower educational level, increasing age, hypertension and unexplained weight loss were significant risk factors for diabetes.
Other variables (obesity, sex, occupation, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking) were not significant risk factors.
There is a low prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and glucose intolerance in the rural population of River Nile State.


Abstract
Primary health care use and health care accessibility among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates.
This study examined primary health care use and accessibility among adolescents living in the United Arab Emirates.
In a cross-sectional study, we collected health care use, sociodemographic and residential data for a sample of 6363 adolescents.
Logistic regression modelling was used to examine predictors of health care use.
The most-consulted health professionals were dentists or orthodontists, family doctors and eye specialists.
Local adolescents were more likely to attend public clinics/hospitals than private facilities, while the opposite was true for expatriates.
In the previous 12 months 22.6% of the participants had not obtained the health care they needed and 19.5% had not had a routine health check-up.
Common reasons for not obtaining care were busy schedules, dislike/fear of doctors and long waiting times.
Improvements to the health care sector may increase health care accessibility among adolescents.


Abstract
Smoking behaviour, knowledge and perceived susceptibility to lung cancer among secondary-school students in Amman, Jordan.
Smoking in Jordan is a serious problem as it affects almost all segments of society including children.
This study aimed to evaluate the smoking behaviour of Jordanian secondary-school students (aged 16-18 years), their awareness of the dangers of smoking and their perceived susceptibility to lung cancer.
Of the stratified random sample of students from Amman schools (n = 648), 43% were ever smokers (had smoked for 1 year) and 27.6% were current smokers, while 81% reported having a smoker in the family.
Students in western Amman (higher socioeconomic status) and those who started smoking at a younger age demonstrated better knowledge about smoking-related consequences.
Perceived susceptibility to lung cancer was significantly associated with sex, perceived seriousness of lung cancer and school location.


Abstract
First report of asthma prevalence in Afghanistan using international standardized methods.
No data on the prevalence of asthma in Afghanistan have been published before.
In a school-based survey in 2010-2011 the wheezing section of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was completed by a random sample of 1500 children aged 6-7 years and 1500 adolescents aged 13-14 years old.
The prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 12.5% in 6-7-year-olds and 17.3% in 13-14-year-olds (P = 0.002).
The prevalence of wheeze in the last 12 months was similar in children and adolescents (19.2% and 21.7% respectively).
The prevalence of ever wheezing, night attacks, speech-limiting wheeze and exercise-induced wheeze was 23.1%, 4.8%, 12.2% and 9.6% respectively in children and 30.5%, 4.4%, 13.0% and 13.6% respectively in adolescents.
These rates are higher than those in neighbouring countries.
This first epidemiological survey of asthma in Afghanistan shows that asthma and wheezing are common in Kabul students.


Abstract
Hepatitis C virus infection and risk factors in health-care workers at Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo, Egypt.
A prospective cohort was followed for a period of 18 months to estimate HCV incidence.
The estimated incidence of HCV infection was 7.3 per 1000 person-years.
HCWs in this setting had a similar high HCV seroprevalence as the general population of greater Cairo.


Abstract
Development of a conceptual model of the role of hospital nurses in health promotion in Jordan.
International evidence reveals that hospital nurses have not been able to incorporate health promotion effectively into the framework of their care.
An integrative review was carried out to develop a conceptual model to assist hospital nurses in Jordan to understand how health promotion activities can be developed.
By understanding the interplay of factors between and within the levels, nurses and other health professionals can draw on the individual, social and organizational factors that influence nurses' role in health promotion.
The proposed model can be considered as a springboard for developing health promotion activities related to hospitals in other Muslim-majority contexts.


Abstract
Managing Jordanian nurse migration to the Gulf Cooperation Council states.
The migration of nurses from Jordan to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states has occurred for decades, although substantial increases have been noted since the 1990s.
This study aimed to identify the push and pull factors for Jordanian-trained nurses to work in the GCC states in order to inform retention policies that might address the issue of nurse migration.
An online survey of a convenience sample of 1241 Jordanian nurses working in GCC states showed that 93% had been employed in Jordan before migration, 85% had migrated to obtain employment and 94% were motivated by higher salary and benefits.
Although 93% planned to return to work in Jordan, only 15% planned to do so in the next 2 years.
Major incentives to migrate were relocation assistance, salary and benefits and career advancement/professional education.
Policy-makers and nurse leaders in Jordan and the GCC states are urged to use these findings to formulate strategies to retain Jordanian nurses in their workplaces.


Abstract
Is diabetes management in primary care improving clinical outcomes?
A study in Qatar.
There has been little research into the effectiveness of primary-care diabetes clinics in the Middle East.
This study in Qatar compared patient outcomes at a primary-care facility with a dedicated diabetes clinic and one without.
Using a cross-sectional method, data on demographics, diabetes status and 6 clinical outcomes of diabetes care were collected from the records of patients who visited the clinics during 2012.
Diabetes management in both facilities improved clinical outcomes over the 1-year observation period.
The mean total cholesterol of patients attending the special clinic (n = 102) decreased significantly from 4.66 to 4.27 mmol/dL and LDL cholesterol from 3.42 to 3.22 mmol/dL.
The LDL cholesterol of patients receiving standard care (n = 108) reduced significantly from 3.41 to 3.22 mmol/dL and HDL cholesterol increased from 0.83 to 0.87 mmol/dL.


Abstract
ing a national combined reporting form for adverse drug reactions and medication errors.
This paper describes the process of introducing the first combined ADR/medication error reporting form in the EU for health-care professionals, the analysis of reports generated by it and the promotion of the system.
A review of existing ADR forms was carried out and recommendations from the European Medicines Agency and World Health Organization audits integrated.
A new, combined ADR/medication error reporting form was developed and pilot tested based on case studies.
The Authority's quality system (ISO 9001 certified) was redesigned and a promotion strategy was deployed.
The process used in Malta can be useful for countries that need to develop systems relative to ADR/medication error reporting and to improve the quality of data capture within their systems.


Abstract
Self-medication with drugs and complementary and alternative medicines in Alexandria, Egypt: prevalence, patterns and determinants.
This study aimed to describe the prevalence, pattern and reasons for self-medication among adults in Alexandria, Egypt.
In a community-based survey during 2012, a representative sample of 1100 adults completed a predesigned interview questionnaire on self-medication practices by drugs and complementary or alternative medicines (CAM).
A majority of them practised self-medication (86.4%), mostly using both drugs and CAM (77.5%).
The most commonly used drugs were analgesics (96.7%), and cough and cold preparations (81.9%), but 53.9% of respondents reported self-medication with antibiotics.
CAM improved the condition according to 95.2% of users.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, occupation and the presence of chronic conditions were the independent factors significantly affecting the practice of self-medication with drugs.


Abstract
Association of caesarean section and neonatal death: a population-based case-control study in Islamic Republic of Iran.
The high caesarean section rate in the Islamic Republic of Iran could be a risk for adverse neonatal outcomes.
This population-based, case-control study investigated the association of caesarean section and neonatal death.
A total of 146 mothers whose babies had died during 28 days after birth were compared with 549 mothers with live newborns, according to delivery route and reasons for undergoing caesarean section.
The crude odds ratio (OR) for the association of caesarean section and neonatal death was 1.97 (1.35-2.87).
The adjusted OR was 2.19 (1.48-3.24) controlled for mother's education, parity and age.
Adjusted ORs for elective caesarean, previous caesarean and emergency caesarean were 0.65 (0.26-1.62), 2.77 (1.64-4.66) and 2.51 (1.56-4.03) respectively.
The association of caesarean section with neonatal death is complex and is modified by other influencing factors.


Abstract
Sociodemographic predictors of acceptance of voluntary HIV testing among pregnant women in a large maternity hospital, Omdurman, Sudan.
This study aimed to determine the sociodemographic predictors of willingness of pregnant women in Sudan to accept HIV testing.
A random sample of 500 pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Omdurman maternity hospital in 2010 were interviewed.
Husband's age ≥ 35 years (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 2.0-5.2) and Christian faith (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.4-10.7) were significant variables, although with a wide margin of confidence.
These predictors should be considered in strategies to increase the acceptance and use of HIV testing and counselling services.


Abstract
Effectiveness of meglumine antimoniate against L. tropica in a recently emerged focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Birjand, eastern Islamic Republic of Iran.
With limited options to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis, constant monitoring of the rate of resistance to pentavalent antimony-based drugs is needed.
This study identified the infecting Leishmania species and evaluated the results of meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®) therapy in a new focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Birjand, eastern Islamic Republic of Iran.
Smears from 150 patients showed that 141 patients were infected by L. tropica and 9 by L. major.
In total, 141 patients with L. tropica infection completed Glucantime® treatment and follow-up; 63.8% were treated intralesionally and 36.2% by intramuscular administration.
The overall success rate after one course of therapy with Glucantime® was 96.5% (136/141), and all the failures (5/141) occurred with intramuscular injections.
Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the failure rates of intramuscular and intralesional injections.
Children < 10 years old had a significantly higher failure rate than adults.


Abstract
Predictive factors of death in patients with tuberculosis: a nested case-control study.
Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of death worldwide.
This study aimed to determine predictive factors for death in patients with tuberculosis to set priorities for public heath interventions to reduce mortality in these patients.
This nested case-control study was carried out in Mazandaran province of Islamic Republic of Iran among tuberculosis patients who were treated during 2002-2009.
Each deceased patient was individually matched with a control patient according to sex, age, area of involvement and time of follow-up.
Potential risk factors for death were evaluated using multivariate conditional logistic regression models.
From 2206 patients 376 cases and 376 matched controls were selected.
Only positive serology for HIV (OR = 19.1), history of kidney disease (OR = 6.81) and use of immunosuppressant drugs (OR = 3.96) significantly increased the risk of death in tuberculosis patients.
These potentially modifiable risk factors could be taken into account in preventive interventions for tuberculosis patients in our country.


Abstract
Central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) is one of the most important problems in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide.
A bundle of CLABSI care measures was introduced at a 13-bed medical/surgical ICU in Kocaeli, Turkey in January 2010.
Compliance rates with the bundle were measured at the beginning of the third quarter of 2010 until June 2013 and compared with CLABSI rates.
Feedback to staff reinforced a culture of patient safety in the ICU.
Infection rates remained zero for 38 months after the implementation.
There was a strong negative correlation between bundle compliance rate and CLABSI rates.


Abstract
Chronic disease burden in Canada poses an imminent public health threat.
The impact of respiratory disease in Canada alone is significant, affecting one in five and leading any other cause of repeat hospitalization in all age groups.
Public health action is considered to be an important means of addressing these issues.
Historical understanding of health has evolved to support the adoption of paradigms by professions that recognize the limitations of medical intervention in addressing the fundamental basis of disease when compared with the broader public health perspective.
As a rapidly evolving profession, there is a need to explore emerging areas of practice opportunities in the discipline.
Investigating alternative knowledge and ideology can ensure that effective strategies for addressing the contemporary respiratory heath needs of Canadians are undertaken.
The present article explores the rationale for a public health- and population-based approach to health in general, and its applicability to the respiratory therapist's role in addressing respiratory health-related issues in Canada.


Abstract
General anesthesia and mechanical ventilation impair pulmonary function, even in normal individuals, and result in decreased oxygenation in the postanesthesia period.
They also cause a reduction in functional residual capacity of up to 50% of the preanesthesia value.
Furthermore, there is substantial evidence that atelectasis, in combination with alveolar hypoventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, is the core mechanism responsible for postoperative hypoxemic events in the majority of patients in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
Many concomitant factors also must be considered, such as respiratory depression from the type and anatomical site of surgery altering lung mechanics, the consequences of hemodynamic impairment and the residual effects of anesthetic drugs, most notably residual neuromuscular blockade.
The appropriate use of anesthetic and analgesic techniques, when combined with meticulous postoperative care, clearly influences pulmonary outcomes in the PACU.


Abstract
The use of alveolar recruitment manoeuvres for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome is a topic of uncertainty in current critical care practice.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome leads to inflammatory atelectasis, which challenges the gas exchange properties of the lung.
Recruitment of atelectatic lung tissue requires elevation of transpulmonary pressure.
Transpulmonary pressure can be suppressed at a given airway pressure when pleural pressures are elevated.
The present review discusses recruitment of lung tissue in detail, highlighting the key research in the field.
Differing techniques for recruiting lung tissue, as well as various outcome measures to determine efficacy, are analyzed and critiqued.
The commonly used sustained inflation manoeuvre is perhaps regarded as the only strategy to recruit the lung, explaining its prevalence.


Abstract
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a form of sleep-disordered breathing characterized by periods of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in oxygen desaturations.
Symptoms and risk factors for OSA are of particular importance in the management of OSA patients in the perioperative setting.
The present study collected data regarding the intraoperative airway management of OSA patients and their course in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) over a six-month period.
Of these, 43% were classified as a grade 1 view by direct laryngoscopy, 43% were grade 2 and 14% were classified as grade 3.
Apnea events or periods of desaturation in the PACU were observed in 27% of cases.
Length of stay was significantly longer for cases in which PACU nurses had indicated that OSA had affected the individuals' postoperative course of treatment.
Symptomatic OSA patients placed increased demands on the PACU in terms of length of stay and hospital resources.


Abstract
Several studies have shown a relationship between exposure to outdoor air pollution and adverse health effects, and that people with specific chronic diseases appear to be particularly vulnerable.
A pilot study was conducted using a small convenience sample of clients/patients and educators at respiratory clinics across Nova Scotia.
Twenty-one clients from three respiratory clinics consented to participate in the study and received the AQHI education program.
A larger-scale study involving participants residing in a moderate- or high-risk region is recommended.


Abstract
Surfactant has revolutionized the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and some other respiratory conditions that affect the fragile neonatal lung.
Despite its widespread use, the optimal method of surfactant administration in preterm infants has yet to be clearly determined.
Based on the present review, knowledge gaps regarding the best way to administer surfactant to neonates remain.
From the available evidence, however, the most effective way to optimize surfactant delivery and obtain a more homogeneous distribution of the drug is by using rapid bolus instillation in combination with appropriate alveolar recruitment techniques.

Since its inception in the 1980s, the Home Oxygen Program in British Columbia was centrally managed by the Ministry of Health.
In 2002, the pilot's model and recommendations were implemented in British Columbia's five health authorities.


Abstract
Possible correlations between age and implant placement were analyzed.
Late presentation of capsular fibrosis occurred a mean of 15.6 years after primary augmentation, with a slightly negative, but not significant, correlation between age at primary operation and duration of implant placement.
Patients <40 years of age underwent an operative revision after a mean of 18.9 years, while patients ≥40 years of age needed an operative revision a mean of 11.9 years after primary breast augmentation (P=0.0368).
The results suggest that with advancing age, the average time to develop capsular fibrosis is significantly shorter in individuals who develop capsular contracture.
As more data are collected, appropriate advice can be provided to patients regarding factors that influence the long-term outcomes of breast augmentation.


Abstract
A combination of lidocaine and bupivacaine, plain or with epinephrine, is readily available in most Canadian health care settings where such procedures are performed, and fulfills these criteria.
However, commercially available solutions of both medications are acidic and cause a burning sensation on injection.
Buffering to neutral pH with sodium bicarbonate is a practical method to mitigate the burning sensation, and has the added benefit of increasing the fraction of nonionized lipid soluble drug available.
The authors report on the proportions of the three drugs to yield a neutral pH, and the results of an initial survey regarding the use of the combined solution with epinephrine in hand surgery.

Proliferative flexor tenosynovitis of the hand is an inflammatory process involving the synovial sheaths surrounding the tendons.


Abstract
Medical support to deployed field forces is increasingly becoming a shared responsibility among allied nations.
National military medical planners face several key challenges, including fiscal restraints, raised expectations of standards of care in the field and a shortage of appropriately trained specialists.
Even so, medical services are now in high demand, and the availability of medical support may become the limiting factor that determines how and where combat units can deploy.
The influence of medical factors on operational decisions is therefore leading to an increasing requirement for multinational medical solutions.
Nations must agree on the common standards that govern the care of the wounded.
These standards will always need to take into account increased public expectations regarding the quality of care.


Abstract
The molecular diagnosis of infection with PRRS virus (PRRSV) is hampered by its considerable strain diversity.


Abstract
Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are frequently run as endpoint ELISAs (e-ELISAs).
However, kinetic ELISAs (k-ELISAs) have certain advantages over e-ELISAs.
The objective of this study was to understand the relationship between e-ELISA and k-ELISA results.
A normalization method for k-ELISA slopes (slope ratio) is proposed.


Abstract
This study investigated the analgesic and systemic effects of intramuscular (IM) versus epidural (EP) administration of tramadol as an adjunct to EP injection of lidocaine in cats.
A prospective, randomized, crossover trial was then conducted with each cat receiving the following 3 treatments: EP injection of 2% lidocaine [LEP; 3.0 mg/kg body weight (BW)]; EP injection of a combination of lidocaine and 5% tramadol (LTEP; 3.0 and 2.0 mg/kg BW, respectively); or EP injection of lidocaine and IM injection of tramadol (LEPTIM; 3.0 and 2.0 mg/kg BW, respectively).
Systemic effects, spread and duration of analgesia, behavior, and motor blockade were determined before treatment and at predetermined intervals afterwards.
The duration of analgesia was 120 ± 31 min for LTEP, 71 ± 17 min for LEPTIM, and 53 ± 6 min for LEP (P < 0.05; mean ± SD).

Abstract
The primary purpose of this case report is to outline the diagnosis, intervention and clinical outcome of a patient presenting with occipital neuralgia.
Upon initial presentation, the patient described a four-year history of stabbing neck pain and headaches.
After providing informed consent, the patient underwent a total of four dry needling (DN) sessions over a two-week duration.
During each of the treatment sessions, needles were inserted into the trapezii and suboccipital muscles.
Post-intervention, the patient reported a 32-point change in her neck disability index score along with a 28-point change in her headache disability index score.
Thus, it appears that subsequent four sessions of DN over two weeks, our patient experienced meaningful improvement in her neck pain and headaches.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing DN to successfully improve clinical outcomes in a patient diagnosed with occipital neuralgia.

Presented here is a narrative review of upper cervical procedures intended to facilitate understanding and to increase knowledge of upper cervical chiropractic care.
These procedures use similar assessments to determine if spinal intervention is necessary and successful once delivered.


Abstract
Postpartum anemia is treated with oral iron supplementation and/or blood transfusion.
Recent studies have evaluated the use of parenteral iron as a better tolerated treatment modality.
Compared with oral iron supplements, parenteral iron is associated with a more rapid rise in serum ferritin and hemoglobin and improved maternal fatigue scores in the postpartum period.
It may also decrease rates of blood transfusion.
Parenteral iron may be considered in select clinical situations for the treatment of postpartum anemia.


Abstract
A key component of the creation of the NPCBB is the establishment of a program that enables cord blood not suitable for banking or transplantation to be used for biomedical research purposes.
The Primer also introduces the NPCBB and describes the systems CBS is implementing to address ethical issues.
The Primer is intended to assist research ethics boards in evaluating the ethical acceptability of research protocols, to facilitate harmonized decision-making by providing a common reference, and to highlight the role of research ethics boards in governance frameworks.
With the Primer we hope to illustrate how the development of such educational tools can facilitate the ethical implementation and governance of programs related to stem cell research in Canada and abroad.


Abstract
Approximately half a million people are thought to develop multidrug-resistant tuberculosis annually.
Barely 20% of these people currently receive recommended treatment and only about 10% are successfully treated.
Poor access to treatment is probably driving the current epidemic, via ongoing transmission.
Treatment scale-up is hampered by current treatment regimens, which are lengthy, expensive, poorly tolerated and difficult to administer in the settings where most patients reside.
Perceived risks - such as the rapid development of resistance to new drugs - need to be balanced against the high levels of mortality and transmission that will otherwise persist.
Doubling access to treatment and increasing treatment success could save approximately a million lives over the next decade.


Abstract
A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the characteristics and case fatality rate of pediatric burns in Mosul, Iraq.
The study group was burn patients aged 14 years and under who were admitted to the Burns Unit in Al-Jamhoori Teaching Hospital from the 1(st) of March 2011 to the 1(st) of March 2012.
Of the 459 emergency burn admissions, 209 (45.53%) were pediatric patients up to 14 years of age, with a mean age of 4.73±3.61 years.
Scald was the most common type of burn and occurred mainly in domestic settings.
The mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 19.73±17.15%.
Thirty-five patients died during the study period, giving a case fatality rate of 16.75%.
The maximum number of deaths occurred in the 2-4 years age group.
The case fatality rate was high in patients having more than 40% TBSA involvement.
Flame burns were significantly more fatal than scalds, with a fatality rate of 35.35% and 12.05% respectively; (p=0.0001).
In conclusion, given that most pediatric burn accidents occur at home, burn prevention should be focused on improving living conditions and on providing an educational program for parents.


Abstract
The aim of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the epidemiological characteristics of patients with high voltage electrical injury from 1999 to 2009.
In total 13,911 patients (including both children and adults, and outpatients as well as hospitalized patients) were treated at our burn center during the period of study.
Of these patients, 1,030 were hospitalized for burns treatment.
For the purposes of this study, we have included only patients with high voltage electrical trauma, of which there were 58, 2 of whom were female.
Basic epidemiological indicators were gathered on these patients, including age, gender, place of accident, extent of trauma, mortality and whether the injury was occupational or non-occupational.
Electrical burns (caused by both low-voltage and high-voltage electric current) made up 1.10% of all burns treated in our burn center and high voltage electrical injuries represented 0.42% of all burn injuries.
The average incidence of high voltage electrical trauma was 0.21 cases/100,000 inhabitants.
The average age of the patients was 28.59 years.
Nine patients died and the mortality was fixed at 15.52%.
The average length of hospitalization was 53.43 days.
The average extent of burnt area was 35.01% TBSA.
In our study, we were able to define the basic epidemiological parameters in 58 patients with high voltage electrical trauma.
We also have to highlight the still disappointingly high number of non-occupational electrical injuries affecting those in the lower age groups, especially children.
However, preventive programmes for educating specific risk groups have shown positive results.


Abstract
Access to specialized burn care is becoming more difficult and is being restricted by the decreasing number of specialized burn centers.
It is also limited by distance and resources for many patients, particularly those living in poverty or in rural medically underserved communities.
Telemedicine is a rapidly evolving technology related to the practice of medicine at a distance through rapid access to remote medical expertise by telecommunication and information technologies.
Feasibility of telemedicine in burn care has been demonstrated by various centers.
Its use facilitates the delivery of care to patients with burn injuries of all sizes.
Most importantly, it allows better effective triage which reduces unnecessary time and resource demanding referrals that might overwhelm system capacities.
However, there are still numerous barriers to the implementation of telemedicine, including technical difficulties, legal uncertainties, limited financial support, reimbursement issues, and an inadequate evidence base of its value and efficiency.


Abstract
The requirements for accurate documentation within the process of burn assessment have increased dramatically over the years.
TBSA (total body surface area) and burn depth are commonly determined by visual inspection, especially in the emergency or acute care setting.
However, inexperience often results in incorrect estimation of these factors.
In 2001, BurnCase 3D was initiated in order to develop a tool for objective burn assessment and documentation on mobile devices (Apple iPhoneTM).
The centerpiece is a 3D model representing the actual patient.
A patient-specific 3D model adapted to the height and weight of the real patient was created and the digital picture was superimposed in the computer system.
The burns were transferred to the model and the TBSA in % was calculated by the software BurnCase 3D.
The preferred methods of the 80 respondents for burn extent estimation were: the Rule of Nines (38%), the Rule of Palm (37%) and the Lund-Browder chart (18%).
Analysis showed very high deviations of TBSA within the participants, even among the group of experts.
In comparison to a computer-aided method we found massive overestimation of up to 230%.
The use of BurnCase 3D could have a true impact on the quality of treatment in burns.
In the acute care setting for burn injuries, telemedicine has great potential to help guide decisions regarding triage and transfer based on TBSA, burn depth, patient age and injury mechanism.


Abstract
Unfortunately, the commonly applied methods of estimation have revealed inaccuracies, which are mostly related to human error.
To calculate the %TBSA (quotient), it is necessary to divide the burned surface area (Burned BSA) (numerator in cm2) by the total body surface area (Total BSA) (denominator in cm2).
This method represents a simple and ready-to-use clinical decision support system which addresses common errors associated with estimations of Burned BSA (=numerator).
Following validation and respective user feedback, it could be deployed for testing in future clinical trials.
This study has a level of evidence of IV and is a brief report based on clinical observation, which points to further study.


Abstract
This paper presents an unusual case of frostbite injury to the breast area caused by faulty cryotherapy application.
Cryotherapy, commonly used by patients and health professionals, relieves pain and edema after trauma and sports injuries.
However, applying cold therapy is not common for surgical procedures involving soft tissue.
The frostbite injury to the breast presented here occurred due to persistent use of a self-prepared ice pack following a needle aspiration biopsy.
Cold exposure to soft tissue may cause frostbite.
It is crucial to inform patients about proper application of cryotherapy and possible complications, particularly for the procedures in which cold therapy is not widely used.


Abstract
It is also true, however, that the developed world still tackles many of the challenges caused by burns.
In order to reduce this problem through preventive programs, the characteristics of this type of injury must be studied and well documented in each setting.
This cross-sectional study, from March 2009 to March 2010, included 6,910 patients with burn injuries who were managed as outpatients.
The patient demographics along with the characteristics of the burn injuries and their outcomes were recorded for each case and then evaluated.
A total of 6,910 burn patients with a mean ± SD age of 30.20 ± 19.11 years presented to our Emergency Department and were treated as outpatients.
Of these, 2,900 were female (41.97%) and 4,010 were male (58.03%).
Most of the patients were in the 25-35 year age group, with a prevalence of 1,148 (28.6% of total) males and 716 females (24.7% of total), followed by those aged <15-years-old.
Most patients had been burned accidentally.
An increase in the instance of self-immolation was identified with an increase in the TBSA burned.
Mean follow-up was 30+/-5 months.
The results revealed that burns were most likely to occur during housekeeping.
Other high risk groups identified were males, those aged from 25 to 35 years-old, and those with lower socio-economic status.


Abstract
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are diseases within the spectrum of severe cutaneous adverse reactions affecting skin and mucous membranes.
Here, we report a rare case of SJS triggered by a combination of clobazam, lamotrigine and valproic acid in a 7-year-old boy.
Because of inadequate seizure control, lorazepam was replaced with clobazam.
He was discharged in a stable condition on the 18th day.
Our case suggests that a drug-drug interaction between valproate, lamotrigine and clobazam contributed to the development of SJS.
When the clobazam was added to valproic acid and lamotrigine co-medication, the lamotrigine dose should have been decreased.


Abstract
This retrospective study was conducted at our centre between February 2008 and January 2012.
The study included 54 patients who sustained burn injuries due to epileptic seizures, accounting for 1.3% of all burn admissions.
All patients, irrespective of the severity of their injuries, were admitted to our centre, assessed, treated and educated regarding specific preventive measures.
All study data were evaluated from patient medical records.
Causes of burn injury were as follows: scald burns (30), contact with hot surfaces (12), electrical burns in the bathroom (6), and flame burns (6).
Second degree burns were the most common (18 out of 54 patients) and third degree burns were the least common.
Upper limb and trunk were the most common sites involved (36 out of 54 patients).
Thirty patients required surgical intervention whereas the remainder was conservatively managed.
Most of the injuries occurred in the age group between 30-37 years.
Injuries occurred predominantly in females [42 females, 12 males; F:M=3.5:1].
The study revealed that patients with epilepsy should be categorized as a high risk group considering the sudden and unpredictable attack of epileptic seizures leading to loss of consciousness and accidental burn injuries.
Early surgical intervention and targeting of all epileptic patients for education and instituting the specific preventive measures gives good outcomes.


Abstract
The electric fly-swatter is a household device used widely in Greece to kill mosquitoes.
It consists of a racket-shaped electrical screen which is free of toxic and other chemicals.
When the screen touches the insects, the contact generates an electric flash of light and the insects are incinerated.
We present the case of a 15% flame burn caused by the flash of light produced by an electric fly-swatter.
According to our review of the literature, this is the second case of burn injury caused by an electric fly swatter.


Abstract
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare condition involving the skin at the dermoepidermal junction, with possible inclusion of mucous membranes.
The condition is associated with systemic toxicity and high mortality rates.
Successful treatment requires optimization of local as well as systemic therapy.
We report the case of a young woman who developed toxic epidermal necrolysis, possibly resulting from lamotrigine therapy.


Abstract
Over the last 50 years, the evolution of burn care has led to a significant decrease in mortality.
The biggest impact on survival has been the change in the approach to burn surgery.
Early excision and grafting has become a standard of care for the majority of patients with deep burns; the survival of a given patient suffering from major burns is invariably linked to the take rate and survival of skin grafts.
The application of topical negative pressure (TNP) therapy devices has demonstrated improved graft take in comparison to conventional dressing methods alone.
The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of TNP therapy on skin graft fixation in large burns.
In all patients, we applied TNP dressings covering a %TBSA of >25.
The following parameters were recorded and documented using BurnCase 3D: age, gender, %TBSA, burn depth, hospital length-of-stay, Baux score, survival, as well as duration and incidence of TNP dressings.
The TNP foam was again fixed with staples to prevent displacement and finally covered with the supplied transparent adhesive film.
A continuous subatmospheric pressure between 75-120 mm Hg was applied (VAC®, KCI, Vienna, Austria).
Thirty-six out of 37 patients, suffering from full thickness burns, were discharged with complete wound closure; only one patient succumbed to their injuries.
The overall skin graft take rate was over 95%.
In conclusion, we consider that split thickness skin graft fixation by TNP is an efficient method in major burns, notably in areas with irregular wound surfaces or subject to movement (e.g. joint proximity), and is worth considering for the treatment of aged patients.


Abstract
This report describes a case of burn injury following exposure to sulfur mustard, a chemical agent used in war.
The aim of this report is to highlight the importance of considering this diagnosis in any war victim, especially during these unfortunate times of rising terrorist activities.


Abstract
Burn injury is still a major problem in Iran, resulting in many reports which are usually dispersed, uncoordinated and probably unreliable.
We created a burn registry comprised of a data entry program with 222 variables for each admitted burn patient.
This program was established in August 2010 at the Iran University of Medical Sciences, Motahari Burn Hospital.
We had 14,277 burn patients from August 2010 to August 2011, 877 of whom were admitted to the hospital.
Of the patients, 65.9% were male and 34.1% were female.
The age was 28.85 years (SD = 19.77).
The most prevalent cause of burn was flame 78.5% (pipe propane gas 57.2; kerosene 19.9%).
The mean total body surface area (TBSA) involvement was 23%.
A total of 77.8% of patients were discharged with partial recovery, while mortality was 8.9%.
The mean hospital stay was 14.63 days (SD =11.07).
The program is designed to help understand the scope of burn injury in Iran, providing information on patients, etiology, and course of treatment.
It also highlights differences between various parts of the country in terms of the causes and frequency of burn injuries.
Moreover, the burn registry provides a basis for further research and surveys for treatment and preventive programs.
Our results showed that, although Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff are highly capable and well-trained, their coverage seems to be less than 50% and needs to be increased.

Abstract
Median overall survival (OS) was 25.1 months and median progression-free survival was 10.2 months.
Comparison of patients aged more or less than 70 years showed no differences in terms of benefits or risks.


Abstract
In the health sector, planning and resource allocation at country level are mainly guided by national plans.
For each such plan, a midterm review of progress is important for policy-makers since the review can inform the second half of the plan's implementation and provide a situation analysis on which the subsequent plan can be based.
The review should include a comprehensive analysis using recent data - from surveys, facility and administrative databases - and global health estimates.
Any midterm analysis of progress is best conducted by a team comprising representatives of government agencies, independent national institutions and global health organizations.
Here we present an example of such a review, done in 2013 in the United Republic of Tanzania.
Compared to similar countries, the results of this midterm review showed good progress in all health indicators except skilled birth attendance.


Abstract
Surveillance for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in low- and middle-income countries started in the 1980s.
In the absence of effective treatment, it was considered acceptable to withhold results from HIV-positive participants.
The corollary is that only participants who wish to receive their test results would be eligible to participate in surveys.
This round table discussion takes a closer look at those two arguments.


Abstract
Vaccines have saved more lives than any other innovation in modern medicine.
National immunization committees play a vital role in the development of evidence-based recommendations for the use of vaccines.
The present article describes the evolution and work of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization in Canada as the group marks its 50th anniversary.
The article also provides insight into the future challenges that the committee is likely to face.


Abstract
The prevalence of obesity in patients with chronic kidney failure and renal transplant candidates has paralleled the epidemic in the general population.
The associated risks of surgical complications and long-term cardiovascular death are significant: most transplant centers consider obesity a relative contra-indication for transplant.
Few studies have focused on conservative weight loss strategies in transplant patients.
Studies using administrative databases have found that only a minority of wait-listed patients lose weight and with no apparent benefit to transplant outcomes.
The only clinical trial in this area found that an intensive weight-loss program had significantly better success (to listing) than self-directed weight loss.
However, only a minority that succeeded with the help of a program (36 %), while the "diet and exercise" group had negligible results.
Laparoscopy has radically shortened the recovery time and decreased the complications associated with bariatric surgery.
Reports in transplant patients, who were previously deemed too medically complex, have demonstrated a dramatic and rapid weight loss.
Surgical complications and the effect on immunosuppression remain the chief concerns regarding the use of bariatric surgery in transplant patients.
Rigorous prospective studies will be essential to properly evaluate the expected weight loss and the effect on pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressive medications.
A routine role for bariatric surgery in transplantation would require evidence of improvements in patient-important outcomes and evidence of safety.


Abstract
The so-called three-delay model that was developed for maternal mortality can be adapted to emergency service delivery.
Adaptation of evaluation frameworks to include emergency sentinel conditions could allow effective monitoring of emergency facilities and further policy development.
Future global emergency health efforts may benefit from incorporating strategies for the planning and evaluation of high-impact interventions.


Abstract
Such patients account for a disproportionately large burden of disease, as evidenced by increased disability, cost, human suffering, and suicide.
This review addresses the definition, causes, evaluation, and treatment of unipolar TRD, as well as the major treatment strategies, including optimization, augmentation, combination, and switch therapies.
Evidence for these options, as outlined in this review, is mainly focused on large-scale trials or meta-analyses.
Finally, we briefly review emerging targets for antidepressant drug discovery and the novel effects of rapidly acting antidepressants, with a focus on ketamine.


Abstract
Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) commonly have syndromal major depression, and depression has been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
Prevalence of depression is between 17% and 47% in CVD patients.
The impact on cardiac outcomes remains unclear.


Abstract
Approximately half of people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also suffer from Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
The current paper examines evidence for two explanations of this comorbidity.
First, that the comorbidity reflects overlapping symptoms in the two disorders.
Second, that the co-occurrence of PTSD and MDD is not an artifact, but represents a trauma-related phenotype, possibly a subtype of PTSD.
Support for the latter explanation is inferred from literature that examines risk and biological correlates of PTSD and MDD, including molecular processes.
Treatment implications of the comorbidity are considered.


Abstract
Late-life depression (LLD) is a growing public and global health concern with diverse clinical manifestations and etiology.
This literature review summarizes neuroimaging findings associated with depression in older adults and treatment-response variability.
LLD has been associated with cerebral atrophy, diminished myelin integrity, and cerebral lesions in frontostriatal-limbic regions.
These associations help explain the depression-executive dysfunction syndrome observed in LLD, and support cerebrovascular burden as a pathogenic mechanism.
Furthermore, this review suggests that neuroimaging determinants of treatment resistance also reflect cerebrovascular burden.
Of the theoretical etiologies of LLD, cerebrovascular burden may mediate treatment resistance.
This review proposes that neuroimaging has the potential for clinical translation.
Neuroimaging also has the potential to similarly inform treatment response variability from treatment with aripiprazole (dopamine modulator) and buprenorphine (opiate modulator).


Abstract
Rates of depression and other psychological disorders are substantially higher in AYAs with cancer when compared with older adults.
Previous research suggests that psychosocial interventions specifically designed for AYA patients are promising, but studies of psychopharmacology treatments for depression are lacking.
There is a pressing need for prospective studies and controlled clinical trials that evaluate the optimal strategies for treating depression in this patient group.


Abstract
Diagnosis of underlying mood disorders in the context of ongoing substance abuse requires careful collection of psychiatric history, and is often critical for optimal treatment planning and outcomes.
Failure to recognize major depression or bipolar disorders in these patients can result in increased relapse rates, recurrence of mood episodes, and elevated risk of completed suicide.
Over the past decade, epidemiologic research has clarified the prevalence of comorbid mood disorders in substance-dependent individuals, overturning previous assumptions that depression in these patients is simply an artifact of intoxication and/or withdrawal, therefore requiring no treatment.
However, our understanding of the bidirectional relationships between mood and substance use disorders in terms of their course(s) of illness and prognoses remains limited.
Like-wise, strikingly little treatment research exists to guide clinical decision making in co-occurring mood and substance use disorders, given their high prevalence and public health burden.
Here we overview what is known and the salient gaps of knowledge where data might enhance diagnosis and treatment of these complicated patients.


Abstract
A sizable proportion of psychiatric patients will seek clinical evaluation and treatment for anxiety symptoms reportedly refractory to treatment.
Pseudo-resistance can be due to clinician errors in selecting and delivering an appropriate treatment effectively, or to patient nonadherence to a course of treatment.


Abstract
The perinatal period is a time of high risk for women with unipolar and bipolar mood disorders.
We discuss treatment considerations for perinatal mood disorders, including unipolar and bipolar depression as well as postpartum psychosis.
We further explore the unique issues faced by women and their families across the full trajectory of the perinatal period from preconception planning through pregnancy and following childbirth.
It is vital to consider the risks of the underlying illness versus risks of medication exposure during pregnancy or lactation.
Lastly, it is important to assess the impact of individual psychosocial stressors and lifestyle factors on treatment response.


Abstract
However, psychiatric comorbidities, including depressive disorders, are common and frequently result in additional functional impairment, treatment costs, and burden on caregivers.
Clinicians may struggle to appropriately diagnose depression in ASD due to communication deficits, atypical presentation of depression in ASD, and lack of standardized diagnostic tools.
Specific risk and resilience factors for depression in ASD across the lifespan, including level of functioning, age, family history, and coping style, have been suggested, but require further study.
Treatment with medications or psychotherapy may be beneficial, though more research is required to establish guidelines for management of symptoms.
This review will describe typical presentations of depression in individuals with ASD, review current information on the prevalence, assessment, and treatment of comorbid depression in individuals with ASD, and identify important research gaps.


Abstract
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and debilitating disorder with significant medical and psychological sequelae.
To date, there are no effective treatments for adults, resulting in high rates of chronicity, morbidity, and mortality.
Recent advances in brain imaging research have led to an improved understanding of etiology and specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying symptoms.
Despite this, there are no treatments focused on targeting symptoms using this empirically supported mechanistic understanding of the illness.


Abstract
Pulmonary function tests are an important tool to assist in the diagnosis and management of patients with respiratory disease.

Abstract
Today's young KEMRI/CDC workers' short-term contracts, and the fragmented city they inhabit and study, make for less bounded and predictable spaces and temporalities.


Abstract
Pharmacy students at the Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar must research and write a thesis to graduate.
Expecting futures in the private commercial sector, thésards regretfully leave the thesis behind.
This article explores the parenthetical nature of this moment - its brief openings and more durable closures - as part of the history of ways of being a pharmacist in post-colonial Senegal.
The thesis as an interlude in students' biographies, curtailed by narrowed horizons of expectation, evokes other contractions: in the range of professional roles open to Senegalese pharmacists, and in the circuits of public health with which they might engage.
Mapping thésards' parenthesis in Dakar is a means of capturing both their urban experience of work and the intertwining spatial, temporal and affective dimensions associated with this work.
The past, probable and possible trajectories of pharmacy work are imprinted and imagined in the space of the city as field, market and polis.
Pharmacists' prospects and aspirations are caught up in broader shifts in how education, (un)employment and entrepreneurship animate relations of association and exchange in Senegal.


Abstract
Over the past fifteen years, the city of Kisumu in western Kenya has emerged as an epicentre of 'global health' interventions, organized by non-governmental and transnational groups.
These interventions involve concrete, practical engagements with the city's populations, but also imaginations and desires, as they intersect with residents' expectations of development.
This article follows the hopes, aspirations and trajectories of people who attach themselves as volunteers to these interventions, or who hope to do so through a process they describe as 'tarmacking'.
In exploring how volunteers orient themselves to ideas of 'empowerment' that are promoted by NGOs and also have influence outside institutional settings, it examines the relations between the landscapes of intervention, the spatial-temporal horizons, and the geographies of responsibility emergent in the city.
Through its association with 'moving ahead' and with development, empowerment implies movement towards some kind of future.
While there is a widely shared sense among volunteers that they are going somewhere, just where that might be is not clearly articulated.
Rather than attempt to pinpoint this destination, this article follows their trajectories in an attempt to grasp why and how it remains obscure.


Abstract
The usefulness of electricity in daily life offers several advantages which cannot be underestimated.
Electricity is needed by industries for manufacturing and also in homes for lighting, cooking, washing, etc.
However, electricity can cause severe life-threatening complications.
This study investigates the trend and mortality risk factors of electrical burn injuries at the Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU) of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ghana.
The Burns Registry at KATH BICU containing information on patients who were admitted for electrical burns was used.
Data on the sex, age, occupation, cause of injury, Total Body Surface Area burned (TBSA) and outcome of admissions was obtained.
GraphPad version 5 was used for the analysis.
There were 13 (2.7%) electrical burns, suffered by 11 males (84.6%) and 2 females (15.4%) out of a total 487 BICU admissions over a 4-year period (July 1, 2009 - June 30, 2013); the mean age of the electrical burn victims was 37.8 years (range = 22-56); the TBSA ranged from 5.0% - 98.0%.
Mortality risk factors identified were high voltage electrical burns, older age (P=0.0250) and TBSA>20% (P=0.048).
Four cases (30.8%) were transferred to the Main Burns Ward (Ward D2C); 6 cases (46.1%) were discharged home; 3 patients (23.1%) died; all deaths were recorded in persons who had high voltage electrical burns.
Electrical burns can be severe and can cause death.
Even though the current study showed that a small population was affected by electrical burns, society has to be continually conscious of the detrimental effects of electrical energy and take the necessary precautions to minimize this type of accident.


Abstract
Burn rehabilitation using hydrotherapy can have multiple benefits for the burn patient.
These therapeutic regimens are repeated daily for 2 to 3 weeks.
Patients showed lasting effects from this regimen (up to 3-6 months), the results becoming permanent with more uniform skin structure, color and visco-elasticity in addition to a decrease in pruritus.
The specifications of clinical protocols are described herein along with the virtues of hot spring hydro-pressure therapy for burn rehabilitation.
The use of hydrotherapy, which has been a controversial topic among burn units across the world, is also discussed.
In North America, hydrotherapy is defined only within the scope of in-patient wound cleansing and is thought to lead to microbial auto-contamination and bacterial resistance.
In Switzerland and France the emphasis of hydrotherapy is on rehabilitation after the wound has closed.


Abstract
The use of immune-enhancing diets (IEDs) has been shown to be beneficial in some categories of critically ill patients.
Forty thermally injured adult patients with 30-50% total body surface area (TBSA) burns, including deep areas ranging from 5-20%, were randomized into a prospective, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.
Laboratory assessment of serum albumin, serum C-reactive protein, total lymphocytic count and serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) was performed at admission, and on days 4, 7 and 14.
Finally, outcomes were assessed by monitoring the survival rate, the length of hospital stay and the incidence of infection.
There were no significant differences between the IED and control group regarding age (28.7±5.32 versus 29.85±5.94), sex, weight, %TBSA (37.75±4.4 versus 38.3±4.84) and %burn depth (11.7±2.36 versus 10.7±2.036).
The incidence of infection (2 versus 8) and the length of hospital stay (16.3±0.92 days versus 17.95±2.96 days) were decreased significantly in the IED group versus the control group.
There was no significant difference between the survival rates in both groups as there was only one death in the control group.
Thanks to IEDs, patient outcome was improved and infectious morbidity and length of hospital stay were reduced, but there was no effect on the survival rates following major burns.


Abstract
Neck contractures after burn injuries produce restrictions in motion and unacceptable aesthetic outcomes.
Although different methods of reconstruction have been used in the treatment of this ailment, a limited and unsatisfactory outcome often results.
Free thin anterolateral flaps have been found to be a good single stage option for reconstruction of post-burn contractures of the neck.
In our study, 11 patients with post flame burn contractures of the neck underwent surgical release and coverage by a free thin anterolateral thigh flap.
Patients were followed up for an average of five years and various aspects of functional and aesthetic rehabilitation were assessed.
Furthermore, none of the flaps had any significant early or delayed complications.


Abstract
Iatrogenic burns are rare and preventable.
The authors present two cases of burns from ECG leads, sustained during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Common features included a long duration spinal MR scan (120 and 60 minutes) and high patient body mass index (BMI >30).
Both patients were discharged within 24 hours of admission, but required a period of outpatient burn care.
The causation of these injuries remains unclear but there are several possible mechanisms including: electromagnetic induction heating, antenna effects and closed-loop current induction.
The authors provide a description of the injuries, discuss possible mechanisms that may lead to burn injury in the MRI environment and suggest ways to reduce the risks of such injuries.

Childhood cancer survivors frequently experience long-lasting consequences of chemotherapy on health outcomes.
Neurocognitive late effects of chemotherapy occur in 40 - 60% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors.
These deficits affect mental health, school performance, job success, and are associated with poor quality of life, therefore presenting a clinical challenge for psychiatrists.
However, not all cancer survivors are impacted by treatment in the same manner and emerging evidence suggests that genetic variation may modulate neurocognitive outcomes.
Much like other complex psychopathologies, neurocognitive deficits in cancer survivors are the result of complex interactions between genetic and environmental variables.
This review describes adverse neurocognitive outcomes observed in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and discusses genetic variability in biochemical pathways targeted by chemotherapeutic agents as a possible mechanism contributing to psychopathology in ALL survivors.


Abstract
Predictors of adherence to antihypertensive medication in northern United Arab Emirates.
This study aimed to assess the predictors of non-adherence to antihypertensive medications in northern United Arab Emirates.
In a cross-sectional, multicentre study in Ajman Emirate, 250 patients with hypertension were randomly selected from outpatient clinics.
Participants answered an interview questionnaire about sociodemographic and clinical data and completed the Morisky medication adherence scale.
Non-adherence to antihypertensive medication was reported by 45.6% of patients.
Sociodemographic predictors of non-adherence were sex and number of children.
Therapy-related predictors of adherence were hospital admissions, number and cost of medications, medication perceived effectiveness and use of traditional remedies.
Patient-related predictors of non-adherence were forgetfulness, method of identifying medication and poor awareness of hypertension complications.
Health-care-related predictors were regular follow up at clinics, education and counselling, frequency of changing medication by physicians and awareness of physicians' instructions.


Abstract
Cancer incidence appears to be rising in a small province in Islamic Republic of Iran: a population-based cohort study.
In 2006 the Iranian national cancer registry reported that Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, a small province located in the southern part of the country, had a low incidence rate of almost all types of cancer.
In a population-based cohort study, data on 660 cases of cancer in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province were analysed after ICD codes had been rechecked and duplicates removed.
Over the period 2007-2009 the annual average incidence rate of all cancers rose significantly by 53.0% and 115.1% in men and women respectively.
Cancers of the prostate, thyroid, bladder and soft tissues decreased over the study period.
Despite the recorded rise, the incidence rates for different sites of cancer (except for skin cancer) were significantly lower compared with their corresponding national rates for 2006.
The results point to improvements in the cancer diagnosis and registry in the province, although real changes in cancer incidence over the period cannot be ruled out.


Abstract
Validation of the Arabic version of the SCOFF questionnaire for the screening of eating disorders.
The high prevalence of eating disorders in Arab countries indicates a need for an Arabic language screening tool.
This study aimed to validate an Arabic version (A-SCOFF) of the British SCOFF questionnaire, a brief tool for the screening of eating disorders in primary health care.
After translation and back-translation the A-SCOFF was given to 123 female patients [mean age 32 (SD 8.8) years] visiting primary health-care centres in Beirut.
Each patient was evaluated by an eating disorders specialist blinded to A-SCOFF results.
The validated Arabic version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the DSM-IV criteria for eating disorders were used as diagnostic references.
The best diagnostic threshold for the A-SCOFF was found to be at 2 positive answers with a sensitivity of 80.0%, a specificity of 72.7% and an area under the curve of 80.0%.
The A-SCOFF questionnaire is accurate and reliable for the early detection of eating disorders in this high-risk population.


Abstract
[Substance use among Lebanese university students: prevalence and associated factors].
Scientific research on use and misuse of substances in Lebanon is scarce.
This study aimed to evaluate the rate of use and abuse of substances among Lebanese youth and identify the determinants and risk factors behind these behaviours.
An observational survey was conducted on 1945 university students selected from the different faculties of the Lebanese University and other private universities.
A self-administered questionnaire based on ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test) was administered.
The prevalence of ever consuming alcohol was 20.9%.
Cannabis (12.3%) and tranquilizers (11%) had the highest rates of ever use among the drugs, whereas cocaine (3.3%) and hallucinogens (3.6%) had the lowest rates.
There is a high prevalence of substance use among university students in Lebanon.
Multidisciplinary support for addicted students is needed to meet their diverse needs.


Abstract
Self-perception of personal oral health in Saudi population: a social media approach.
Subjective perceptions and perceived needs for dental care in a population can provide important information for policy-makers.
The questionnaire was uploaded to the Internet and the link to it was made available through popular social networking sites in Saudi Arabia.
With respondents recruited by snowball methods a total of 4618 people (57.2% males, 42.8% females) completed the questionnaire.
The total mean score for the participants was 23.0 (SD 5.0) (scale range 13-39).
Self-perceived oral health was rated as poor by 24.2% of respondents, average by 50.6% and good by 25.2%.
Educational level, age and region but not sex were significantly associated with self-perceived oral health.


Abstract
[Status of health and oral health of the elderly population in Lebanon].
Lebanon is in demographic transition as more people reach increasingly older age; 10% of the population in Lebanon is elderly.
The incidence of chronic diseases and oral diseases increases significantly with age.
However, 55% of the elderly have no health insurance and 82% have no dental insurance.
Both noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and oral diseases are a major health burden in the country and share the same risk factors.
The WHO strategy for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases should therefore be a new approach for the prevention and control of dental diseases among Lebanese elderly.
This paper aims to increase the awareness of the medical community in Lebanon about the interrelationship between general and oral health in the elderly and concludes with the need for the Ministry of Health to develop policies and national action plans against NCDs to reduce not only mortality from NCDs but also morbidity from oral diseases.


Abstract
Strategies to avert preventable mortality among mothers and children in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: new initiatives, new hope.
We conducted an assessment of maternal, newborn and child health and progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).
We provide recommendations for scaling up and sustaining gains post-2015.
Data were obtained from global data repositories.
We constructed time trends from 1990 to 2013 and evaluated inequities across the Region.
Under-5, neonatal and maternal mortality rates decreased 46%, 35%, and 50% respectively from 1990 to 2013.
Pneumonia and diarrhoea accounted for 50% of all post-neonatal deaths; pregnancy- and delivery-related complications were the leading causes of neonatal and maternal deaths.
Coverage of maternal, newborn and child health interventions is suboptimal, and poverty, food insecurity and conflict are pervasive across the Region.
The EMR has made progress but is unlikely to attain MDG 4 and 5 targets.
To sustain and further accelerate gains, the Region must reduce inequities and scale up implementation of recommendations made by the independent Expert Review Group.

After several days, this was followed by headache, confusion and, ultimately, respiratory failure, coma and death.


Abstract
Cosmetic surgeons have experimented with a variety of substances to improve soft tissue deformities of the face.
Autologous fat grafting provides significant advantages over other modalities because it leaves no scar, is easy to use and is well tolerated by most patients.
Autologous fat grafting has become one of the most popular techniques in the field of facial plastic surgery.
Unfortunately, there are still two major problems affecting survival rate and development: revascularization after transplantion; and cell reservation proliferation and survival.
Since Zuk and Yosra developed a technology based on adipose-derived stem cells and cell-assisted lipotrophy, researchers have hoped that this technology would promote the survival and reduce the absorption of grafted fat cells.
Autologous adipose-derived stem cells may have great potential in skin repair applications, aged skin rejuvenation and other aging-related skin lesion treatments.
Recently, the study of adipose-derived stem cells has gained increased attention.
More researchers have started to adopt this technology in the clinical treatment of facial soft tissue deformity.
The present article reviews the history of facial soft tissue augmentation and the advent of adipose-derived stem cells in the area of the clinical treatment of facial soft tissue deformity.


Abstract
Unintended pregnancy is a major social and public health problem with adverse effects on neonatal and developmental outcomes, as well as maternal health and wellbeing.
Traditionally, family planning policies have focused on increasing contraceptive uptake in non-users; however, rates of non-use are low in many developed nations.
A high proportion of unintended pregnancies are attributable to contraceptive failure, particularly when using barrier and short-acting hormonal contraceptives.
Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) are highly effective and have been shown to reduce unintended pregnancy rates.
Despite this, global utilization rates are low, and IUCD uptake in Canada has been particularly low.
In this review we explore why IUCDs are not more widely used, and specifically focus on barriers and misperceptions that may influence IUCD uptake, particularly in Canada.
We reviewed relevant articles published in English between 1990 and 2014, through searches of PubMed and Medline, including primary studies of any design containing information on the knowledge and attitudes of health care providers and women.
Providing education to care providers, women, and policy makers may help overcome misperceptions about the use of IUCDs, and may facilitate greater use.
Increased support from federal and provincial health programs may also encourage the use of IUCDs in Canadian women, and help to reduce unintended pregnancy rates.


Abstract
Association between payer mix and costs, revenues and profitability: a cross-sectional study of Lebanese hospitals.
This study aimed to examine the association between the payer mix and the financial performance of public and private hospitals in Lebanon.
The sample comprised 24 hospitals, representing the variety of hospital characteristics in Lebanon.
The distribution of the payer mix revealed that the main sources of revenue were public sources (61.1%), out-of-pocket (18.4%) and private insurance (18.2%).
Increases in the percentage of revenue from public sources were associated with lower total costs and revenues, but not profit margins.
An inverse association was noted between increased revenue from private insurance and profitability, attributed to increased costs.
Increased percentage of out of- pocket payments was associated with lower costs and higher profitability.
The study provides evidence that payer mix is associated with hospital costs, revenues and profitability.
This should initiate/inform discussions between public and private payers and hospitals about the level of payment and its association with hospital sector financial viability.


Abstract
Spatial accessibility of the population to urban health centres in Kermanshah, Islamic Republic of Iran: a geographic information systems analysis.
Geographic information systems (GIS) analysis has not been widely used in underdeveloped countries to ensure that vulnerable populations have accessibility to primary health-care services.
This study applied GIS methods to analyse the spatial accessibility to urban primary-care centres of the population in Kermanshah city, Islamic Republic of Iran, by age and sex groups.
In a descriptive-analytical study over 3 time periods, network analysis, mean centre and standard distance methods were applied using ArcGIS 9.3.
The analysis was based on a standard radius of 750 m distance from health centres, walking speed of 1 m/s and desired access time to health centres of 12.5 mins.
The proportion of the population with inadequate geographical access to health centres rose from 47.3% in 1997 to 58.4% in 2012.
The mean centre and standard distance mapping showed that the spatial distribution of health centres in Kermanshah needed to be adjusted to changes in population distribution.


Abstract
Measles vaccination coverage and seroprevalence of anti-measles antibody in south-east Islamic Republic of Iran.
Discrepancies often exist between recorded immunization coverage and the real immunity level in a community.
To estimate the vaccination coverage against measles in south-east Islamic Republic of Iran, a crosssectional study was conducted in 3 districts during summer 2011.
Using probability proportional to size cluster sampling, 1368 children aged 30-54 months were selected.
Serum samples of 663 who had received 2 injections of mumpsmeasles- rubella (MMR) vaccine were checked for anti-measles IgG.
Vaccination coverage for the second dose of MMR vaccine was 93.7%.
The prevalence of anti-measles IgG in those who had received at least 2 MMR vaccine doses was 94.6%.
There was a statistically significant association between the serological results and variables that reflected poor accessibility to health services.
Combining serological results with coverage data, the proportion of the community protected against measles was estimated as 88.6%, which was below the limits defined for the measles elimination goals.


Abstract
Knowledge, attitudes and practices of sweet food and beverage consumption and its association with dental caries among schoolchildren in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.
The prevalence of dental decay is expected to rise in many developing countries due to the growing consumption of sugars.
This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of sweet food and beverage consumption among schoolchildren in Jazan, Saudi Arabia and to determine the relationship with dental caries.
In a cross-sectional, descriptive study 853 children aged 6-15 years (520 boys and 333 girls) were assessed by questionnaire and clinical examinations.
Caries prevalence (≥ 1 dft/DMFT) was high (91.3%).
While knowledge was generally good, 83.5% boys and 85.8% girls had poor attitudes to sweet foods and > 90% frequently consumed sweet foods/beverages.
Multiple regression analysis showed that children whose mothers were less educated (OR 2.46; 95% CI: 1.15-5.28) and children with poor dietary attitudes and practices (OR 4.05; 95% CI: 2.33-7.03 and OR 7.80; 95% CI: 4.50-13.52 respectively) were more likely to have dental caries.
Well-directed health promotion programmes are needed in Jazan.


Abstract
Prevalence and risk factors of diabetes mellitus in a central district in Islamic Republic of Iran: a population-based study on adults aged 40-80 years.
Previous studies on type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Islamic Republic of Iran were mainly performed in provinces with large populations.
This study determined the prevalence and risk factors of diabetes mellitus in an adult population (40-80 years old) from Yazd district.
Multistage, systematic cluster random sampling was used in a crosssectional, population-based survey.
Demographic, clinical and anthropometric data were collected, with diabetes defined as fasting blood sugar ≥ 7 mmol/L or a positive medical history of diabetes.
The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of diabetes in 2090 individuals participants was 24.5% (95% CI: 22.2-26.8%), including 10.5% new cases.
For each year of ageing, the prevalence of diabetes increased significantly by 4% and this trend was more pronounced in females than males.
Low education and hypertension were significantly associated with diabetes prevalence.
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Yazd is greater than the average levels nationwide and those of nearby countries.


Abstract
Obesity-linked diabetes in the Arab world: a review.
The Arab world is experiencing an epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
This review summarizes the major pathological factors linking obesity to diabetes, focussing on current epidemiological data related to obese diabetic patients in the Arab world, the etiology of the disease and the genetic determinants of diabetes and obesity.
There are alarming data related to the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in children of Arab ethnicity.
Replication studies identify several genetic variants in Arabs with obesitylinked diabetes.
For example, variants of the ADIPOQ gene (the rs266729 single-nucleotide polymorphism) are associated with obesity and diabetes in various Arab countries.
Gaps exist in our information about diabetes and obesity in Arab populations in relation to ethnic-specific cut-off points for diagnosis and treatment of diabetes.
Further genome-wide association studies in obese and diabetic Arab populations could add to our understanding of the pathophysiology, prevention and reversal of this disease.


Abstract
Altababa medical volunteer group mission to Almanagil hospital, Sudan: new ideas for long-term partnership, success factors and guidelines for other groups.

This paper documents steps in the planning and evaluation of AMVG's first mission to Almanagil hospital in Sudan in 2013.
A total of 247 trainees and patients completed a 22-item evaluation survey.


Abstract
Frequency, types and determinants of degenerative complications of type 2 diabetes in Morocco: "EpiDiaM" cohort inclusion data.
Degenerative complications as a result of diabetes impose a heavy disease burden and increase mortality.
This study presents epidemiological and clinical profiles of diabetic patients in the EpiDiaM cohort study, which include 1196 diabetic cases recruited from the basic health care network in the city of Fez.
The majority (77.7%) were women.
The mean duration of diabetes was 8 (SD 6.6) years.
Hypertension was found in 49.3% of the cohort, 77.9% were overweight or obese and 63.8% had one or more complications.
Among those with complications, retinopathy was the most common (69.4%), followed by heart conditions (50.8%), neuropathy (45.6%) and renal disease (4.8 %).
The high prevalence of complications emphasizes the need to address the avoidable risk factors and prevent complications.


Abstract
Evidence Brief--Trends and projections of obesity among Canadians.
The prevalence of obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher for adults and as 2 standard deviations above the World Health Organization growth standard mean for children, has increased in many parts of the world.
Obese adults are at an increased risk of certain chronic conditions, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some cancers, and of premature death.
Obese children have increased cardiometabolic risk, including dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and elevated blood pressure.
Excess childhood body weight that continues into adulthood can affect quality of life, educational attainment and earnings over the lifecourse.
The Public Health Agency of Canada has projected an annual direct health care cost (including physician, hospitalization and medication costs) of those categorized as obese in Canada in constant 2001 Canadian dollars.
Canadian estimates from 2006 and 2008 that used different methodologies place the annual economic burden (direct and indirect costs) of obesity between $4.6 billion and $7.1 billion.
The purpose of this evidence brief is to show current Canadian obesity prevalence rates and estimates for the future using objectively measured height and weight to calculate BMI.
The use of objectively measured height and weight to derive BMI is strongly recommended, especially for children and adolescents, as self- or proxy-reported height and weight tend to underestimate actual weight and consequently BMI and obesity prevalence.


Abstract
--Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health: A Snapshot of Canadian Actions 2015.
In 2012, Canada and other United Nations (UN) Member States endorsed the "Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health" (Rio Declaration), a non-binding pledge which calls on World Health Organization (WHO) Member States to improve/influence the working and living conditions that affect health and well-being.
The Rio Declaration sets out actions to address health inequities in five themes: to adopt better governance for health and development; to promote participation in policy making and implementation; to further reorient the health sector towards reducing health inequities; to strengthen global governance and collaboration; and to monitor and increase accountability.


Abstract
Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a new genome-based technology showing great promise in delineating the genetic basis of autism thus facilitating diagnosis and in the future, the selection of treatment.
NGS can have a targeted use as well as provide clinically important findings from medically actionable variants regarding the risk of other disorders.
As more is learned about the genomic basis of autism, the clinical utility of the risk information will increase.
But at what cost?
As the medical management that ensues from primary and secondary (incidental) findings grows, there will be increased pressure on sub-specialists with a longer and more circuitous pathway to care.
This will result in higher costs to health care systems and to families.
Health technology assessment is needed to measure the additional costs associated with NGS compared to standard care and to weigh these costs against additional health benefits.
Well-designed data collection systems should be implemented early in clinical translation of this technology to enable assessment of clinical utility and cost-effectiveness and to generate high quality evidence to inform clinical and budget allocation decision-making.


Abstract
Hoarding is traditionally considered a disorder of adulthood but hoarding symptoms often begin in childhood and adolescence.
However, there is very little published research into hoarding in youth.
As described in this commentary, the study of hoarding in childhood and adolescence is important because hoarding symptoms: 1) often begin in childhood and adolescence; 2) often are chronic and persist into adulthood; and, 3) are associated with a number of negative outcomes and sequelae.
Improved understanding of hoarding in children and adolescents could in turn help minimize the negative effect of hoarding on the affected individuals, their families and society.


Abstract
In a quarterly cohort of 3000 PTB patients reported as successfully treated, 1847 (61.5%) underwent all follow-up sputum examinations, with a higher proportion of new cases (65%) than retreatment cases (45%).
The mid-continuation phase follow-up sputum examinations were commonly missed, and 11% patients had not undergone end-of-treatment follow-up sputum examinations.

Abstract
While public health infrastructure has responded remarkably to the HIV epidemic, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, in both HIV-infected and non-infected individuals, is increasing rapidly.
Applying lessons learned from the scale-up of HIV/AIDS services may help with the implementation of an effective response to the challenges of the emerging NCD epidemic.
We suggest that a successful response should include integrated service delivery, capacity building to provide disease-specific care, and strong partnerships to mobilize communities.


Abstract
Some of the first MDR-TB patients were not started on appropriate treatment due to delayed diagnosis or to excessively rigid application of National TB Programme guidelines.


Abstract
Among 3643 retreatment patients, 2657 (73%) were successfully treated and 309 (8.5%) failed.
This study shows that retreatment patients who have failed treatment for their first TB episode are almost twice as likely to fail a second time (13.5%).


Abstract
Insufficient operational research (OR) is generated within programmes and health systems in low- and middle-income countries, partly due to limited capacity and skills to undertake and publish OR in peer-reviewed journals.
To address this, a three-module course was piloted by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and Médecins Sans Frontières in 2009-2010, with 12 participants.
Five received mentorship and financial support as OR Fellows.
Eleven of 12 participants submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal within 4 weeks of the end of the course.
Evaluation shows that participants continued OR activities beyond the course.
Some described changes in policy and practice influenced by their research, and changes in their organisation's approach to OR.
They provided recommendations for improving and expanding OR.
We conclude that participants can, with certain enabling conditions, take research questions through to publication, use skills gained to undertake and promote OR thereafter and contribute to improvement in policy and practice.
An internet-based network will provide participants and graduates with a platform for collection of course outcomes and ongoing mentor- and peer-based support, resources and incentives.


Abstract
Diabetes (DM) is a problem in Fiji and threatens tuberculosis (TB) control efforts.
A review was conducted of all TB patients registered in Fiji in 2011 to assess routine practices of screening for DM.
Of 221 TB patients, 138 (62%) had their DM status recorded in their case folders; 18 (13%) had a known history of DM.
There are deficiencies in screening TB patients for DM in Fiji, and improvements are needed.

Abstract
One of the world's leading causes of death, tuberculosis (TB) remains a stigmatized and feared disease.
Prevention, diagnosis, and adherence to TB treatment remain a challenge for many people, including migrants, those with alcohol and drug dependency, sex workers, people living with the human immunodeficiency virus, and individuals with disabilities.
Low levels of TB treatment literacy and ignorance of transmission risks are common, and-along with inadequate funding for treatment support-contribute to patients' non-adherence to treatment.
Recent cases involving the detention of individuals with TB in Kenyan and Canadian correctional facilities illustrate the circumstances under which individuals interrupt treatment and how health authorities seek restrictive measures to oversee and compel treatment.
The legitimacy of restrictive measures is often defended by international public health authorities in relation to the non-binding Siracusa Principles.
Yet in practice, as illustrated by examples from Kenya and Canada, government authorities and local laws sometimes do not fully meet, or entirely disregard, the requirements in the Siracusa Principles that restrictions on rights in the name of public health be strictly necessary and the least intrusive available to reach their objective.
In addition, more specific standards are required at the international level to guide states' development and use of rights-restricting measures to address TB.

Overall, bleach sedimentation increased the yield of smear-positive TB detection; however; it also increased the time to results.


Abstract
Fifty completed forms displayed errors, but only 16 (4%) resulted in an incorrect triage priority being assigned.
This experience shows that the SATS can be implemented successfully and used accurately by nurses in an ED in Pakistan.


Abstract
Ensuring quality of data during electronic data capture has been one of the most neglected components of operational research.
Allocating resources to these issues can pose a significant bottleneck for operational research in resource-limited settings.

This study assessed the characteristics of beneficiaries of a government-led policy of exemption for payment being provided in a regional hospital in Nepal.


Abstract
Due to their nature and complexity, clinical trials often take some time to launch after the protocol has been designed and ethics approval obtained.
During this time, there may be changes in international treatment guidelines and recommendations that result in a conflict between study protocol and recommended international best practice.
Here, we describe the situation that arose in a pharmacokinetic study on the use of two different doses of rifabutin in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated tuberculosis who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a lopinavir-ritonavir-based regimen in South Africa and Viet Nam.
The study protocol specified that ART should be started 10 weeks after the start of anti-tuberculosis treatment.
The study in South Africa was approved in June 2008, went ahead as scheduled and was completed in August 2010.
The study in Viet Nam was approved in October 2008 and was started in June 2010.
A few weeks later, the World Health Organization released their 2010 guidelines for adult ART; one of its strong recommendations (with moderate quality of evidence) was that ART should be started 2-8 weeks after the start of anti-tuberculosis treatment.
Emerging scientific evidence also supported this recommendation.
The investigators felt that the Viet Nam study protocol was in conflict with recommended international best practice, and the trial was stopped in October 2010.
An amended study protocol in which ART was started at 2 weeks was developed and implemented.
The ethics issues around this decision and the need to change the study protocol are discussed in this article.


Abstract
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death, and is estimated to kill more than 5 million persons each year worldwide.
Tobacco use and exposure to second-hand smoke pose a major public health problem in the Philippines.
Since 2007, Bloomberg Philanthropies has supported the accelerated reduction of tobacco use in many countries, including the Philippines.
Progress in the Philippines is discussed with particular emphasis on the period since ratification of the WHO FCTC, and with particular focus on the grants programme funded by the Bloomberg Initiative.
Despite considerable progress, significant challenges are identified that must be addressed in future if the social, health and economic burden from the tobacco epidemic is to be alleviated.

Family members should be trained to use a suitable DOT support package.


Abstract
A structured training course on operational research (OR) based on the model created by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and Médecins Sans Frontières was conducted in the South Asian region in 2012.
Many innovations were introduced into the administration, structure and content of the course.
Appropriate modifications have been made to the structure and processes of the next course scheduled for 2013.
We describe these modifications and the innovations, successes and challenges of this model of training.


Abstract
We compared the performance of LED-FM (July-December 2012) to that of conventional microscopy (July-December 2011) across 190 sites.
We recommend replacing conventional microscopy with LED-FM in high workload microscopy centres in India.


Abstract
We call for a simpler, standardised format for in-text and bibliography reference citations, so that researchers can concentrate on the science and its interpretation rather than fonts and punctuation.


Abstract
Overall, the additional yield of the second sputum sample was <2%; it did not vary with pretreatment smear grading.


Abstract
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which is epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), may threaten gains made in tuberculosis (TB) control, as DM is both a major risk factor for developing active TB and it can lead to adverse TB treatment outcomes.
Despite World Health Organization guidance that all TB patients should be screened for DM, most facilities in LMICs that manage TB patients do not currently perform screening for DM, due in part to the cost and complexity involved.
DM screening is further complicated by the presentation of transient hyperglycemia in many TB patients, as well as differences in diabetes risk factors (e.g., body mass index) between TB patients and the general public.
In this article, we review existing and new technologies for DM screening that may be more suitable for TB patients in LMICs.
Such methods should be rapid, they should not require fasting, and they should allow the provider to differentiate between transient and longer-term hyperglycemia, using inexpensive tools that require little training and no specialized infrastructure.
Several methods that are currently under development, such as point-of-care glycated hemoglobin and glycated albumin assays, non-invasive advanced glycation end-product readers, and sudomotor function-based screening devices, offer interesting performance characteristics and warrant evaluation in populations with TB.


Abstract
Countries in Asia, such as India and China, will bear the brunt of this unfolding epidemic.
Persons with DM have a significantly increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) that is two to three times higher than in persons without DM.
This article reviews the epidemiology and interactions of these two diseases, discusses how the World Health Organization and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease developed and launched the Collaborative Framework for the care and control of TB and DM, and examines three important challenges for care.
These relate to 1) bi-directional screening of the two diseases, 2) treatment of patients with dual disease, and 3) prevention of TB in persons with DM.
For each area, the gaps in knowledge and the priority research areas are highlighted.
Undiagnosed, inadequately treated and poorly controlled DM appears to be a much greater threat to TB prevention and control than previously realised, and the problem needs to be addressed.
Prevention of DM through attention to unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles and childhood and adult obesity must be included in broad non-communicable disease prevention strategies.
This collaborative framework provides a template for action, and the recommendations now need to be implemented and evaluated in the field to lay down a firm foundation for the scaling up of interventions that work and are effective in tackling this dual burden of disease.


Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB) and adversely affect TB treatment outcomes.
A descriptive study was carried out in registered TB patients screened for DM at Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India.
Of 458 TB patients, 66 (14%) had DM.
In those with dual disease, age ≥40 years, smear-positive pulmonary TB and recurrent TB were significantly more common.
There was no effect of DM on TB treatment outcomes, although there was a trend towards smear non-conversion at 2 months.
Screening for DM works well, and certain patient characteristics are more common in those with dual disease.


Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and smoking are risk factors for adverse outcomes in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).
In a tertiary care hospital at Belgaum in the South Indian State of Karnataka, all TB patients aged ≥18 years consecutively diagnosed from February to September 2012 were evaluated for DM and smoking.


Abstract
In 2009, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and Médecins sans Frontières Brussels-Luxembourg (MSF) began developing an outcome-oriented model for operational research training.
In January 2013, The Union and MSF joined with the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) at the World Health Organization (WHO) to form an initiative called the Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT).
This integrates the training of public health programme staff with the conduct of operational research prioritised by their programme.
SORT IT programmes consist of three one-week workshops over 9 months, with clearly-defined milestones and expected output.
This paper describes the vision, objectives and structure of SORT IT programmes, including selection criteria for applicants, the research projects that can be undertaken within the time frame, the programme structure and milestones, mentorship, the monitoring and evaluation of the programmes and what happens beyond the programme in terms of further research, publications and the setting up of additional training programmes.
There is a growing national and international need for operational research and related capacity building in public health.
SORT IT aims to meet this need by advocating for the output-based model of operational research training for public health programme staff described here.
It also aims to secure sustainable funding to expand training at a global and national level.
Finally, it could act as an observatory to monitor and evaluate operational research in public health.
Criteria for prospective partners wishing to join SORT IT have been drawn up.


Abstract
In 2011, bi-directional screening for tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), although how best to implement the activity was not clear.
In India, with early engagement of national programme managers and all important stakeholders, a countrywide, multicentre operational research (OR) project was designed in October 2011 and completed in 2012.
The results led to a rapid national policy decision to routinely screen all TB patients for DM in September 2012.
The process, experience and enablers of implementing this unique and successful collaborative model of operational research are presented.


Abstract
Prevention of mother-to-child transmission 'Option B+' originated in Malawi in 2011 to prevent new infections in infants exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
We assessed 12-month programme retention and HIV testing uptake among infants born to HIV-infected mothers from September 2011 to June 2012 in Thyolo District Hospital.
Of 513 infants, 368 (71.7%) remained in care at 12 months.
Eighty-eight (17.2%) infants had both tests as scheduled.
Measures are needed to improve adherence to national testing protocols.


Abstract
Pakistan's National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) is missing data on many tuberculosis (TB) cases who visit private providers.
A survey on the incidence and under-reporting of TB in Pakistan provided a database for exploring the investigation and referral of presumptive TB cases by private health providers.
The survey showed that private health providers requested both sputum smear and X-ray for diagnostic investigations.
Of 2161 presumptive TB cases referred, 1189 (55%) were sent for investigations to a district NTP TB centre, of whom only 314 (26.4%) were registered.
This indicates an urgent need to strengthen the link between private health providers and NTP to enhance TB notification.


Abstract
From 2000 to 2012, Malawi scaled up antiretroviral therapy (ART) from <3000 to 404 905 persons living with HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome), representing an ART coverage of 40.6% among those living with HIV.
During this time, annual tuberculosis (TB) notifications declined by 28%, from 28 234 to 20 463.
Percentage declines in annual TB case notifications were as follows: new TB (26%), recurrent TB (40%), new smear-positive pulmonary TB (19%), new smear-negative pulmonary TB (42%), extra-pulmonary TB (19%), HIV-positive TB (30%) and HIV-negative TB (10%).

Rapid assessment of Malawi's civil registration and vital statistics system.


Abstract
We report the outcome of investigations conducted in 73 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected Ugandan adults presumed to have pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
Following initial investigations, 32 of 73 patients were diagnosed with PTB.
Of the remaining 41 patients initially classified as 'non-PTB', six had a delayed PTB diagnosis after a median of 6 weeks.
Of the six patients lost to follow-up, four (66%) were reported to have died.
Active tracking and close monitoring of HIV-infected patients presumed to have PTB independently of initial investigation results may reduce morbidity and mortality among this vulnerable patient group.


Abstract
The median age of the patients was 39 years, and most (92%) were male.
Two thirds (33/49) of the patients had a successful TB treatment outcome.
A previous TB episode and residence in a semi-urban area were associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes.
Separate diagnostic and treatment algorithms, including regular adherence counselling and opioid substitution therapies, should be considered for PWUIDs.


Abstract
In 2013, through the paediatric tuberculosis (TB) programme started by the Tajikistan Ministry of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières in 2011, 21 children became the first to be treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in Tajikistan.
We describe the challenges encountered in establishing the programme and the solutions to these challenges, and propose a framework to guide the implementation of paediatric DR-TB care.
This framework could prove useful for other NTPs in resource-limited settings.


Abstract
This retrospective observational review documents the efforts of the Swaziland National Tuberculosis (TB) Control Programme between 2004 and 2014.
The objective is to describe the disparity between actual declines in case notification and increases in estimated incidence.


Abstract
Between 2000 and 2012, the annual numbers of patients treated for tuberculosis (TB) in Malawi declined by 28%, from 28 234 to 20 463.


Abstract
Case notification rates of tuberculosis (TB) in Bangladesh remain poor despite a high burden of disease.
Over the 55 months of the evaluation, 32 587 members of key populations were screened for TB, with 1587 smear-positive TB cases detected.


Abstract
The purpose of this study was 1) to examine the health-seeking behaviour of TB patients and the costs borne by TB patients in Nigeria, and 2) to assess the social impact of TB disease on TB patients and their families/households.
Of 260 TB patients surveyed, the majority (74.7%) were aged between 20 and 49 years.
Overall, households experienced a shortfall of about US$57.30 (N = 9174.72) or 24.9% of income loss due to TB illness.
Further analysis revealed that 9.7% of TB patients relied on children of school age or below to finance the costs of TB illness.


Abstract
Given the well-known linkage between diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB), the World Health Organization recommends bidirectional screening.
Here we report the first screening effort of its kind from a chest clinic in the Ampara district of Sri Lanka.
Of 112 TB patients registered between January 2013 and October 2014, eight had pre-existing DM.
Screening TB patients for DM was found to be feasible at the district level.


Abstract
In 2009, the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) jointly developed a new paradigm for operational research (OR) capacity building and started a new process of appointing and supporting OR fellows in the field.
In June 2009, the first OR fellow in India was appointed on a full-time basis and the second was appointed in February 2012-both had limited previous experience in OR.
The reasons for this success are highlighted along with ongoing challenges.
This experience from India provides good evidence for promoting similar models elsewhere.


Abstract
The reduction in global neonatal mortality rates remains a challenge.
Internationally recognized protocols for hospital care of sick and small newborns are limited, although this specialized area lends itself to standardization.
Successful features and challenges are discussed.
It is realistic to develop, implement and disseminate neonatal protocols for sick newborns.


Abstract
To meet the global demand for training assistance in tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a systematic model was created to conduct training-of-trainers courses.
The Teachback
Method
ology curriculum was created using adult learning principles and implemented by collaborating with partners to create training-of-trainers courses.
During training-of-trainers courses, the participants practice teaching a course.
Trainers observe the participants' performance and provide feedback on training skills and accuracy of course content.
The methodology can be integrated with TB and HIV courses to enhance training capacity and help build a competent workforce.


Abstract
Data from a tuberculosis (TB) prevalence survey conducted in 24 communities in Zambia and the Western Cape, South Africa, January-December 2010, were analysed to determine the influence of smoking, hyperglycaemia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on TB symptom reporting in culture-confirmed TB cases.
Of 123 790 adults eligible for enrolment, 90 601 (73%) consented and 64 463 had evaluable sputum samples.
ORs and 95%CIs were calculated using a robust standard errors logistic regression model adjusting for clustering at community level.
HIV-positive TB cases were more likely to report cough, weight loss, night sweats and chest pain than non-HIV-positive TB cases.
TB cases who smoked or had hyperglycaemia did not report symptoms differently from cases without these comorbidities.


Abstract
Survey responses confirmed the under-utilization of RPT: 82% of survey respondents selected cost as a significant or potential barrier to use.
This campaign was based on a common evidence base built in part by the stakeholders themselves.
After multiple engagements with communities and providers, Sanofi US announced on 12 December 2013 that they would drop the price of RPT to US$32 per blister pack of 32 tablets for US public health programs.
While further work remains to secure access to RPT in the United States and worldwide, the lowering of the price of RPT reflects the positive impact that collaborative advocacy can accomplish, and sets an example for other drug companies to follow.


Abstract
A total of 767 primary health care providers, including private and public sector practitioners, health workers and chemists, were interviewed.
A quarter of the primary health care providers reported using POC tests, with pregnancy tests being the most common.
Nearly half of the respondents expressed willingness to use POC tests for TB, provided the test was available free or at low cost (<US$ 2.00).


Abstract
We audited the programme to identify factors affecting treatment outcomes.
A multivariable regression analysis found that male sex was associated with unfavourable outcome (P = 0.009).


Abstract
The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) is the oldest international non-governmental organisation involved in the fight against tuberculosis.
The vision adopted by The Union at that time was 'Health solutions for the poor'.
In this viewpoint article we outline our reasons for believing that this narrower vision is incompatible with The Union's mission statement, and we argue that making such a change would be a mistake.


Abstract
All countries in Africa have made a commitment to eliminate measles by 2020.
This is laudable, as measles elimination will have a crucial impact on reducing childhood mortality.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), outbreaks continue unabated despite repeated vaccination campaigns and high reported coverage by the Ministry of Health.
This paper brings into question the effectiveness of the current approach and the need for better reflection on bottlenecks and strategies that can address this issue.


Abstract
A total of 2699 children were assessed between 2008 and 2011.


Abstract
Incentives included the provision of a bar of soap, a bucket, a mosquito net, sugar, cooking oil, a jerrycan and a delivery kit.
The first ANC visits increased by 48% in the first year to 60% in the second.
Subsequent visits did not show a similar pattern due to ruptures in incentive stocks.


Abstract
Massachusetts is one of five states that mandate the reporting of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI).
We assessed 2006-2008 Massachusetts surveillance data for LTBI to describe the system and examine the characteristics of persons with LTBI.
Over 3 years, 15 301 LTBI cases were reported (4742-5398/year).
Among those with known country of birth (n = 11 655), 9983 (85.7%) were foreign-born.


Abstract
The objectives of this study were to describe demographics, basic biosecurity practices, ownership structure, and prevalence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in swine sites located in 3 regions in Ontario, and investigate the presence of spatial clustering and clusters of PRRS positive sites in the 3 regions.
A total of 370 swine sites were enrolled in Area Regional Control and Elimination projects in Niagara, Watford, and Perth from 2010 to 2013.
Demographics, biosecurity, and site ownership data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and site locations were obtained from an industry organization.
Status was assigned on the basis of available diagnostic tests and/or assessment by site veterinarians.
Spatial dependence was investigated using the D-function, the spatial scan statistic test and the spatial relative risk method.
Results showed that the use of strict all-in all-out (AIAO) pig flow and shower before entry are uncommon biosecurity practices in swine sites, but a larger proportion of sites reported having a Danish entry.
The prevalence of PRRS in the 3 regions ranged from 17% to 48% and localized high and low risk clusters were detected.
Sites enrolled in the PRRS control projects were characterized by membership in multiple and overlapping ownership structures and networks, which complicates the way the results of monitoring and disease management measures are communicated to the target population.


Abstract
Up to 20 fresh fecal samples were collected from each of the 99 participating operations.


Abstract
A lapse of 45 d was required between initial sampling and any previous treatments.
Choice of anthelmintic (oral benzimidazoles, and both injectable and pour-on endectocides) was at the discretion of the producer so as not to alter the local control programs.


Abstract
Hemorrhage is a major concern in patients undergoing hepatic surgery or in those with hepatic trauma.
In these cases, employing traditional hemostatic strategies can be problematic due to the diffuse nature of hepatic hemorrhage and limited opportunities for direct hemostasis.
This study assessed the efficacy of a bovine-derived thrombin solution, (BT), as a topical liquid agent to augment hemostasis and survival following severe hepatic hemorrhage in a rat model.
Heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), packed cell volume (PCV), and overall survival were evaluated in 54 rats randomly assigned to receive topical application of BT, saline, or suture ligation applied immediately to a liver lobe following controlled laceration.
Six additional rats received liver laceration with no applied treatment.
Intravenous fluid resuscitation was initiated and HR and ABP were recorded for 60 min, after which survivors were recovered from anesthesia.
Rats were then monitored for 72 h, after which survivors were euthanized.
There was no significant difference in survival time, percentage survival, intra-operative ABP or HR, or post-operative PCV between treatment groups.
There is insufficient evidence to recommend BT as the sole therapy using this delivery method for mitigating severe hemorrhage from liver injury.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol alone or in combination with a constant-rate infusion (CRI) of remifentanil.
Six adult dogs were given 2 treatments in a randomized crossover study with a 7-day interval between treatments.
Treatment 1 was propofol (P) and treatment 2 was propofol and remifentanil (P-Rem), without any premedication.
Propofol was induced using a TCI system with a predicted plasma concentration (Cp) of 6.0 μg/mL.
Anesthesia was maintained within the Cp range (0.65 to 3.0 μg/mL) for 120 min and remifentanil was administered at a rate of 0.3 μg/kg body weight (BW) per minute, CRI.
Cardiopulmonary variables were recorded before (baseline), during, and 120 min after drug administration.
Heart rate (HR) decreased significantly in the P-Rem group (46%) compared with baseline values.
In the P-Rem group, the cardiac index (CI) decreased significantly (49% to 58%) and the stroke volume (SV) decreased compared with baseline values.
The systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) increased significantly in the P-Rem group compared with baseline values.
There was no difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between the groups.
Central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) significantly increased in the P-Rem group compared with baseline values.
In conclusion, the hemodynamic changes observed in this study indicate a compromise of the cardiovascular system, although the dogs in this study were healthy/euvolemic and there was no change in preload.
More studies are required in order to evaluate the actual safety of the combination of propofol and remifentanil in patients with reduced cardiac reserve.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to compare normal and severely affected ears in dogs with objective measurements using ImageJ software.
Ear canals were harvested from cadavers with normal ears and from dogs that underwent total ear canal ablation for unresolved otitis.


Abstract
In horses, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (insulin dysregulation) are associated with the development of laminitis.
Although obesity is associated with insulin dysregulation, the mechanism of obesity-associated insulin dysregulation remains to be established.
We hypothesized that oxidative stress in skeletal muscle is associated with obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia in horses.
Thirty-five light breed horses with body condition scores (BCS) of 3/9 to 9/9 were studied, including 7 obese, normoinsulinemic (BCS ≥ 7, resting serum insulin < 30 μIU/mL) and 6 obese, hyperinsulinemic (resting serum insulin ≥ 30 μIU/mL) horses.
Markers of oxidative stress (oxidative damage, mitochondrial function, and antioxidant capacity) were evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies.
A Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to determine relationships between markers of oxidative stress and BCS.
Furthermore, to assess the role of oxidative stress in obesity-related hyperinsulinemia, markers of antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage were compared among lean, normoinsulinemic (L-NI); obese, normoinsulinemic (O-NI); and obese, hyperinsulinemic (O-HI) horses.
Increasing BCS was associated with an increase in gene expression of a mitochondrial protein responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis (estrogen-related receptor alpha, ERRα) and with increased antioxidant enzyme total superoxide dismutase (TotSOD) activity.
When groups (L-NI, O-NI, and O-HI) were compared, TotSOD activity was increased and protein carbonyls, a marker of oxidative damage, decreased in the O-HI compared to the L-NI horses.
These findings suggest that a protective antioxidant response occurred in the muscle of obese animals and that obesity-associated oxidative damage in skeletal muscle is not central to the pathogenesis of equine hyperinsulinemia.

Abstract
Situational analysis: preliminary regional review of the Mental Health Atlas 2014.
To update the Atlas of Mental Health 2011, specific indicators from the Mental Health Action Plan and additional indicators on service coverage were incorporated into the questionnaire for the Atlas 2014.
The data will help facilitate improvement in information gathering and focus efforts towards implementation of the Mental Health Action Plan.
The questionnaire was completed by the national mental health focal point of each country.
This preliminary review seeks to consolidate data from the initial response to the Atlas 2014 questionnaire by Member States in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Data for this review were analysed for the whole Region, by health systems groupings and by individual countries.
Where possible, data are compared with the Mental Health Atlas 2011 to give a longitudinal perspective.


Abstract
Reorganization of mental health services: from institutional to community-based models of care.
Mental health services in the Eastern Mediterranean Region are predominantly centralized and institutionalized, relying on scarce specialist manpower.
This creates a major treatment gap for patients with common and disabling mental disorders and places an unnecessary burden on the individual, their family and society.


Abstract
Informing mental health policies and services in the EMR: cost-effective deployment of human resources to deliver integrated community-based care.
The important factors that need to be in place to support skill mix/task shifting and good integrated care are outlined with reference to EMR countries.


Abstract
Integration of mental health into priority health service delivery platforms: maternal and child health services.
Maternal and child health (MCH) programmes are the most logical and appropriate platforms for integration of mental health care in an equitable, accessible and holistic manner.
Such integration has the potential to improve both mental and physical health synergistically.


Abstract
Mental health and psychosocial support in humanitarian emergencies.
Armed conflicts and natural disasters impact negatively on the mental health and well-being of affected populations in the short- and long-term and affect the care of people with pre-existing mental health conditions.
This paper outlines specific actions for mental health and psychosocial support by the health sector in the preparedness, response and recovery phases of emergencies.


Abstract
Promotion of mental health and prevention of mental disorders: priorities for implementation.
There is compelling evidence from high-quality studies that mental health promotion and primary prevention interventions can reduce the risk of mental disorders, enhance protective factors for good mental and physical health, and lead to lasting positive effects on a range of social and economic outcomes.
This paper reviews the available evidence in order to guide the implementation of mental health promotion and prevention interventions in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
The paper identifies a number of priority areas that can generate clear health and social gains in the population and be implemented and sustained at a reasonable cost.
The interventions cover population groups across the lifespan from infancy to adulthood and include actions delivered across different settings and delivery platforms.
"Best practices" were identified as interventions for which there is evidence not only of their effectiveness but also of their feasibility within resource constraints.
The implications of the findings for capacity development are considered.


Abstract
Mental health surveillance and information systems.
Routine information systems for mental health in many Eastern Mediterranean Region countries are rudimentary or absent, making it difficult to understand the needs of local populations and to plan accordingly.


Abstract
Mental health research: developing priorities and promoting its utilization to inform policies and services.
Investment in research on the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders is disproportionately low in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) relative to the disease burden.
Scaling-up mental health research in the EMR could generate enormous returns in terms of reducing disability, improving outcomes and preventing premature death, through early diagnosis, better management and community-based rehabilitation.
EMR countries must therefore work to identify research priorities, mobilize resources, develop human and infrastructure capacities and institutionalize use of research findings to guide development of policies and service delivery models.


Abstract
Acceptability of the human papilloma virus vaccine among Moroccan parents: a population-based crosssectional study.
Data about the public's awareness and acceptability of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine are lacking in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
This study aimed to explore parental acceptability of HPV vaccination for their daughters in Morocco.
A cross-sectional survey was carried out among mothers and fathers of girls aged 12-15 years at 12 middle schools from 6 regions of Morocco.
Despite weak knowledge of genital warts and HPV infection, acceptability of the HPV vaccine was 76.8% (95% CI: 73.3-79.9%) among mothers and 68.9% (95% CI: 65.2-72.5%) among fathers.
Only 8.8% of mothers and 7.0% of fathers were against administration of the HPV vaccine to their daughters.
Predictors of parents' acceptance of the HPV vaccine were living in precarious housing/slums and low household income (for mothers) and living in urban areas (for fathers).
These results will be useful for preparing the introduction of the HPV vaccine in health ministry programmes.


Abstract
Dietary total antioxidant capacity and the risk of breast cancer: a case-control study.
There is growing evidence that dietary antioxidants may have favourable effects in reducing cancer risk.
In a case-control study we investigated the association of dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and risk of breast cancer.
Sociodemographic data, medical history and anthropometric measurements were collected from 275 women (100 breast cancer cases & 175 controls).
Participants ' usual dietary intake was measured using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and their dietary TAC was estimated.
An inverse, but non-significant, association was observed between dietary TAC and breast cancer risk.
Multiple logistic regression models based on TAC of individual food groups showed that consumption of fruits and vegetables with higher TAC (μmolTE/100 g) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer.
Our study supports a protective effect of dietary antioxidants in relation to breast cancer risk.
Food selection based on TAC of foods may be an effective strategy to modify the risk of cancer.


Abstract
The Persian version of the LMUP was tested on randomly selected married women aged 15-49 years in the city of Ajabshir, East Azerbaijan province, north-west of Islamic Republic of Iran.
The internal consistency of the scale was acceptable (Cronbach alpha coefficient 0.87).
Structural indicators of the Kaiser-Meyer- Olkin measure (0.85) and Bartlett test of sphericity (P < 0.001) verified interpretability of the exploratory factor analysis output.
Applicability of the Persian version of the LMUP is accepted.
Further investigation is needed to understand cultural norms that might influence Iranian women's responses to queries about pregnancy intentions.


Abstract
Cytohistological correlation and discrepancy of conventional Papanicolaou smear test with corresponding histopathology: a retrospective study over a 5-year period.
The accuracy of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing can be measured using the cytohistological correlation and discrepancy method.
This study aimed to evaluate and compare the cytohistological correlation and discrepancy of the conventional Pap test with the corresponding histopathology and to compare the data with other similar studies.
A retrospective study was performed at the pathology department of a referral hospital in Muscat, Oman, over a 5-year period.
Of 6000 Pap smears, 162 had matching histopathology results (abnormal smear rate 2.7%) but 10 were unsatisfactory for histological diagnosis.
Cytohistological correlation was seen in 96/152 (63.2%), while discrepancy was seen in 56/152 (36.8%).
False negatives and false positives were found for 7 and 49 cases respectively.
The findings of this study confirm the role of conventional Pap testing as a screening test for the diagnosis of cervical lesion but not for management of patients.
In comparison with other studies, we also report a low percentage of abnormal Pap smears.


Abstract
Epidemiology and medical cost of hospitalization due to rotavirus gastroenteritis among children under 5 years of age in the central-east of Tunisia.
Data on the economic burden of rotavirus infection in Tunisia are needed to inform the decision to include rotavirus in routine childhood immunizations.
This study aimed to describe the epidemiological profile of rotavirus disease in central-east Tunisia and to estimate its hospital cost.
In the first stage - the prospective collection of epidemiological data - we enrolled all patients < 5 years old who were hospitalized for acute diarrhoea at 5 university paediatric departments in central-east Tunisia during the period 2009-2011.
Rotavirus was responsible for 65 (23.3%) of the 279 cases enrolled.
In the second stage, cost data were collected retrospectively using an activity-based costing method from the medical records of the children who were positively diagnosed with rotavirus.
The average cost of care per child was TD 433 (SD 134).
This is a significant economic burden in Tunisia, where a safe and effective vaccine is available but not yet introduced to the immunization schedule.


Abstract
Epidemiology of rabies in Oman: a retrospective study (1991-2013).
Animal bites and rabies are under-reported in many developing countries and there is poor understanding of the disease burden.
The aim of this study was to map the epidemiology of animal bites and rabies in Oman over the period 1991-2013.
In a cross-sectional, descriptive, surveillance-based study, all data about animal bites and rabies from the national communicable disease surveillance system were analysed.
A total of 22 788 cases of animal bites were reported.
Most bites were to males (70%) and the 10-19 year age group (26%).
Cats were the most common animal and upper extremities were the most common bite site.
There were 8 rabies cases reported during the study period, mostly due to bites from wild animals, with 100% mortality.
Of 758 suspected animals tested, 56.1% were positive for rabies; foxes had the highest positivity rate (70.1%).
The high incidence of animal bites in Oman emphasizes the importance of a rabies prevention and control programme.


Abstract
Health literacy among schoolteachers in Çorum, Turkey.
Teachers' health literacy is an important part of school health promotion programmes.
This study in 2013 assessed health literacy and related factors in schoolteachers in Çorum, Turkey.
In a cross-sectional study, 500 primary and secondary teachers answered a questionnaire about self-reported health behaviours and completed the 6-item Newest Vital Sign tool.
The mean score on the health literacy scale was 2.12 (SD 1.82).
Overall, 44.0% of the teachers had very limited, 29.8% limited and 26.2% adequate health literacy.
In binary logistic regression analysis, the risk of limited health literacy was significantly greater in the older age groups, in men and in those whose partner was an educator or a housewife.
In view of the low health literacy levels, we suggest that teacher candidates could benefit from health education programmes after graduation.


Abstract
Contributions of public and private sectors to the Iranian cataract surgery output.
This study determined trends in the contributions of the public and private sectors to the cataract surgery output in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Data about cataract surgeries performed at surgical centres throughout the nation were extracted from patient charts for a 5-year period from 2006 to 2010.
Of the total 516 273 surgeries performed in 2010, more were done in public sector centres (61.7%) than private ones (38.3%).
The total number of surgeries increased by 59.1% between 2006 and 2010.
Analysis of the relative contributions of the public and private sectors showed a 41.0% increase in surgeries in public centres and 100.5% in private centres over the 5-year period.
Thus the rate of growth of cataract surgery in the private sector was 2.7 times greater than that in the public sector.
Despite a smaller contribution to the total number of cataract surgeries, the private sector has experienced a substantial rate of growth.


Abstract
Diet and the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in a Syrian population: a case-control study.
Diet has not been investigated as a potential risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas in the Syrian Arab Republic.
In a hospital-based, unmatched case-control study 108 people with cancer and 105 controls were interviewed about dietary intake using a validated food frequency questionnaire in Arabic.
Sociodemographic and health risk behavioural information were collected by a self-completed questionnaire.
These findings should be considered in national health promotion programmes in the Syrian Arab Republic.


Abstract
Clinical profile and factors associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with HIV/AIDS: a retrospective analysis from Tripoli Medical Centre, Libya, 2013.
In Libya, little is known about HIV-related hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality.
This was a retrospective analysis of HIV-related hospitalizations at Tripoli Medical Centre in 2013.
Of 227 cases analysed, 82.4% were males who were significantly older (40.0 versus 36.5 years), reported injection drug use (58.3% versus 0%) and were hepatitis C virus co-infected (65.8% versus 0%) compared with females.
Severe immunosuppression was prevalent (median CD4 count = 42 cell/μL).
Candidiasis was the most common diagnosis (26.0%); Pneumocystis pneumonia was the most common respiratory disease (8.8%), while cerebral toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 8.4% of patients.
Current HAART use was independently associated with low risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.33), while central nervous system symptoms (OR 4.12), sepsis (OR 6.98) and low total lymphocyte counts (OR 3.60) were associated with increased risk.
In this study, late presentation with severe immunosuppression was common, and was associated with significant in-hospital mortality.


Abstract
Assessment of women's perspectives and experiences of childbirth and postnatal care using Q-methodology.
To complement standard measures of maternity care outcomes, an assessment of women's satisfaction with care is needed.
The aim of this study was to elicit the perspectives and experiences of Iraqi women about childbirth and postnatal care services.
The study participants were a sample of 37 women of different educational and socioeconomic status who had given birth during the previous 6 months.
Q-methodology was used for data collection and analysis.
Needs assessment around providers' skills and attitudes and the wider sociocultural environment of childbirth and postnatal care is necessary in Iraq.


Abstract
Physicians' knowledge and practice towards medical error reporting: a cross-sectional hospital-based study in Saudi Arabia.
Identifying reasons for under-reporting is crucial in reducing the incidence of medical errors.
We studied physicians' knowledge of the occurrence, frequency and causes of medical errors and their actual practice toward reporting them.
A cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire was answered by 107 physicians at a tertiary-care hospital in Saudi Arabia.
The questionnaire had 6 sections covering demographic data, knowledge, attitudes and practice towards reporting medical errors, perceived causes of and frequency of medical errors in their hospital and personal experiences of medical error reporting.
Physicians tended not to report medical errors when no harm had occurred to patients.
One-third of respondents feared punitive actions if they reported errors and only 56.4% felt that error reporting had led to positive changes in overall care.
A majority of errors were related to late interventions and misdiagnosis.
Under-reporting of medical errors was common in this hospital.
Physicians did not appreciate attempts to improve the system of error reporting and a culture of blame still prevailed.


Abstract
Determinants of hand hygiene compliance in Egypt: building blocks for a communication strategy.
Hand hygiene of health-care staff is one of the most important interventions in reducing transmission of nosocomial infections.
This qualitative study aimed to understand the behavioural determinants of hand hygiene in order to develop sustainable interventions to promote hand hygiene in hospitals.
Fourteen focus group discussions were conducted with nurses in 2 university hospitals in Egypt.
The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed.
Thematic analysis was conducted by 2 independent investigators.
The findings highlighted that nurses did not perceive the benefits of hand hygiene, and that they linked the need to wash hands to a sense of dirtiness.
Knowledge of hand hygiene and related products was limited and preference for water and soap was obvious.
Environmental constraints, lack of role models and social control were identified as barriers for compliance with hand hygiene.
A multi-faceted hand hygiene strategy was developed based on existing cultural concepts valued by the hospital staff.


Abstract
Hyperreactio luteinalis is a rare condition in which there is massive cystic enlargement of the ovaries, mimicking malignancy, during pregnancy.
When confronted with this condition, the fear of missing a cancer diagnosis often leads the physician to react with unnecessary surgical intervention, potentially resulting in impaired future fertility.
The literature on the subject contains mainly case reports and one small case series.
A recent review attempted to summarize what is currently known, but there has not yet been a pervasive change in the approach to the management of this condition.
In order to define the natural history of the condition and its maternal and fetal effects, we examined all case reports available in the English literature from 1993 to 2014, in addition to another as yet unpublished case report.
Our analysis suggests that, despite its impressive presentation with ovarian enlargement and hyperandrogenism, hyperreactio luteinalis tends to be self-limiting, with spontaneous postpartum resolution and without untoward maternal or fetal sequelae.
In particular, fetal virilization is rare, and dependent on the timing of hyperandrogenism.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes are likely a consequence of the abnormally high hCG levels observed in many of these gestations, and the subset of women with these abnormal values should be considered for enhanced surveillance.
Vaginal delivery is preferred, and strategies to sustain the potential for breastfeeding must be introduced while maternal androgen levels fall, allowing lactation to be established.
Considering its benign nature and postpartum resolution, management of HL must be conservative, and continued education of health care professionals who may encounter this entity is vital.


Abstract
Operational research (OR) in public health aims to investigate strategies, interventions, tools or knowledge that can enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness or performance of health systems.
Attention has recently been drawn to the lack of OR capacity in public health programmes throughout the Pacific Islands, despite considerable investment in implementation.
This lack of ongoing and critical reflection may prevent health programme staff from understanding why programme objectives are not being fully achieved, and hinder long-term gains in public health.
The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) has been collaborating with Pacific agencies to conduct OR courses based on the training model developed by The Union and Médecins Sans Frontières Brussels-Luxembourg in 2009.
The first of these commenced in 2011 in collaboration with the Fiji National University, the Fiji Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and other partners.
The Union and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community organised a second course for participants from other Pacific Island countries and territories in 2012, and an additional course for Fijian participants commenced in 2013.
Twelve participants enrolled in each of the three courses.
This article describes the context, process and outputs of the Pacific courses, as well as innovations, adaptations and challenges.


Abstract
Of 79 patients, 65 (82%) completed screening.
Two (3%) patients with active TB and 16 (25%) with LTBI were referred for anti-tuberculosis treatment and isoniazid preventive therapy, respectively.


Abstract
Mentorship is a key feature of operational research training courses run by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and Médecins Sans Frontières.
This article explores the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
Our collective experience indicates that 'hands-on' mentorship is a valuable learning experience for the participant and a rewarding experience for the mentor.
This approach increases the likelihood of successful course completion, including publishing a well written paper.
However, mentors must allow participants to lead and take ownership of the paper, in keeping with a first author position.


Abstract
The forecast consequences of climate change on human health are profound, especially in low- and middle-income countries and among the most disadvantaged populations.
Innovative policy tools are needed to address the adverse health effects of climate change.
Cash transfers are established policy tools for protecting population health before, during and after climate-related disasters.
For example, the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Programme provides cash transfers to reduce food insecurity resulting from droughts.
We propose extending cash transfer interventions to more proactive measures to improve health in the context of climate change.
We identify promising cash transfer schemes that could be used to prevent the adverse health consequences of climatic hazards.
Another example is cash transfers provided to communities that decide to move to areas in which their lives and health are not threatened by climatic disasters.
More research on such interventions is needed to ensure that they are effective, ethical, equitable and cost-effective.


Abstract
The anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, and panic disorder.
This intermediate phenotype can then provide a substrate for understanding and developing medicines and psychological treatments.


Abstract
The neural circuitry of fear processing involves the amygdala, anterior cingulate, and insular cortex, while cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry plays a key role in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
More recently, neuroimaging studies have examined how psychotherapy for anxiety and related disorders impacts on these neural circuits.
We conclude that, although each of these related disorders is mediated by somewhat different neural circuitry, CBT may act in a similar way to increase prefrontal control of subcortical structures.
These findings are consistent with an emphasis in cognitive-affective neuroscience on the potential therapeutic value of enhancing emotional regulation in various psychiatric conditions.


Abstract
Physiological and adaptive separation anxiety (SA) is intimately connected with the evolutionary emergence of new brain structures specific of paleomammalians, the growth of neomammalian--and later hominid--brain and skull size, and the appearance of bipedalism.
All these evolutionary milestones have contributed to expanding the behavioral repertoire and plasticity of prehuman and human beings, at the cost of more prolonged dependency of the infant and of the child on parental care.
Separation anxiety disorder (SAD) can be seen as an exaggerated/inappropriate manifestation of SA that constitutes a gateway to poorer mental and physical health.
By blending epidemiological, genetic-epidemiological, endophenotypic, and animal laboratory approaches, it is possible to delineate some of the mechanisms that link childhood-adolescence SA and SAD to health problems later in life.


Abstract
Here we argue that hormonal systems play a key role in mediating social anxiety, and so may be important in SAD.
Hormonal alterations, often established early in development through the interaction between biological and psychological factors (eg, genetic predisposition x early trauma), predispose to socially fearful, avoidant, and submissive behavior.
However, whereas gene variants and histories of trauma persist, hormonal systems can be remodeled over the course of life.
Indeed, the developmental plasticity of our social brain, and thus of social behavior in adulthood, critically depends on steroid hormones such as testosterone and peptide hormones such as oxytocin.
These steroid and peptide hormones in interaction with social experiences may have potential for reprogramming the socially anxious brain.
Certainly, single administrations of oxytocin and testosterone in humans reduce socially fearful, avoidant, and submissive behavior.
Such work may ultimately lead to new approaches to the treatment of SAD.


Abstract
Modern anxiolytic drug discovery mainly targets specific pathways and molecular determinants within a single phenotypic domain.
However, greater understanding of the mechanisms of action is possible through animal models.
In this review, we focus on the three most common animal models of anxiety in mice used in the screening of anxiolytics.
Both conditioned and unconditioned models are described, in order to represent all types of animal models of anxiety.
Behavioral studies require careful attention to variable parameters linked to environment, handling, or paradigms; this is also discussed.
Finally, we focus on the consequences of re-exposure to the apparatus.
Test-retest procedures can provide new answers, but should be intensively studied in order to revalidate the entire paradigm as an animal model of anxiety.


Abstract
At least one third of patients with anxiety disorders do not adequately respond to available pharmacological treatment.
It is suggested that several biological factors may influence treatment mechanisms in anxiety and therefore could be identified as possible biomarkers predicting treatment response.


Abstract
This article describes the history of the nosology of anxiety disorders.
Greek and Latin physicians and philosophers distinguished anxiety from other types of negative affect, and identified it as a medical disorder.
Ancient Epicurean and Stoic philosophers suggested techniques to reach an anxiety-free state of mind that are reminiscent of modern cognitive psychology.
Between classical antiquity and the late 19(th) century there was a long interval during which anxiety was not classified as a separate illness.
However, typical cases of anxiety disorders kept being reported, even if under different names.
In the 17(th) century, Robert Burton described anxiety in The Anatomy of Melancholy.
Panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder may be recognized in the "panophobias" in the nosology published by Boissier de Sauvages in the 18(th) century.
Also, anxiety symptoms were an important component of new disease constructs, culminating in neurasthenia in the 19(th) century.
Emil Kraepelin devoted much attention to the possible presence of severe anxiety in manic-depressive illness, thereby anticipating the "anxious distress" specifier of bipolar disorders in DSM-5.
A pitfall to consider is that the meaning of common medical terms, such as melancholia, evolves according to places and epochs.


Abstract
Anxiety disorders, including panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and separation anxiety disorder, are the most prevalent mental disorders and are associated with immense health care costs and a high burden of disease.
According to large population-based surveys, up to 33.7% of the population are affected by an anxiety disorder during their lifetime.
Substantial underrecognition and undertreatment of these disorders have been demonstrated.
Anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with other anxiety disorders and other mental disorders.


Abstract
A large amount of research has accumulated on the efficacy and effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia.
Additionally, we discuss the difficulties that arise when comparing active CBT treatments, and we suggest directions for future research.
Overall, CBT appears to be both efficacious and effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but dismantling studies are needed to determine which specific treatment components lead to beneficial outcomes and which patients are most likely to benefit from these treatment components.


Abstract
They often begin at an early age and can have some serious consequences.
This article is an overview of the recent studies concerning group cognitive-behavioral interventions for anxiety disorders.
In the last few years, anxiety disorder prevention for children and adolescents has become an important focus of research work.
Numerous cognitive behavioral group therapies for children as well as adults have been well studied.
There are many CBT protocols that have been developed for treating specific anxiety disorders.


Abstract
This 65 year-old female retired office worker presented with chronic back pain.
Imaging findings included disc extrusion and spinal stenosis.
Multiple co-morbidities and the complex nature of this case substantiated the need for multidisciplinary collaboration.
A doctor of chiropractic and a doctor of osteopathy provided collaborative care based on patient goal setting and supported by structured interdisciplinary communication, including record sharing and telephone consultations.
Chiropractic and medical interventions included spinal manipulation, exercise, tobacco reduction counseling, analgesic use, nicotine replacement, dietary and ergonomic recommendations, and stress reduction strategies.
Collaborative care facilitated active involvement of the patient and resulted in decreased radicular symptoms, improvements in activities of daily living, and tobacco use reduction.


Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is an extremely common condition that creates substantial personal and health care costs.
An important recognised risk factor for OA is excessive or abnormal mechanical joint loading.
Accurate imaging methods of LLD have made it possible to study the biomechanical effects of mild LLD (LLD of 20mm or less).
This review examines the accuracy of these methods compared to clinical LLD measurements.
It then examines the association between LLD and OA of the joints of the lower extremity.
We propose that mild LLD may be an important instigator or contributor to OA of the hip and lumbar spine, and that it deserves to be rigorously studied in order to decrease OA's burden of disease.


Abstract
The 26 year old man had injured his right shoulder while trying to reach a distant socket with his shoulder 90° abducted and in extreme external rotation.
After initial treatment failure in chiropractic, the patient sought an orthopaedist and physiotherapy care.
A contrast magnetic resonance examination revealed a SLAP lesion.
Awaiting orthopaedic consultation and in the absence of clinical improvement the patient sought care from a second chiropractor.
Clinical examination revealed a mild winging of the right scapula and the presence of trigger points in the rotator cuff muscles, biceps, rhomboids and serratus anterior.
The chiropractic treatment then included soft tissue mobilization and the prescription of strengthening exercises of the serratus anterior and rotator cuff muscles.
After 4 sessions, the patient did not feel any pain and gradually resumed all his recreational activities.
Clinicians should be aware that SLAP lesions are difficult to identify clinically and that manual therapy might be an important component of conservative treatment of SLAP lesions.


Abstract
This study documents the existence and topographic anatomy of a rare case of variant forearm arteries found in the left upper limb of a 68-year-old male cadaver.
The common interosseous artery and recurrent ulnar arteries branched from the radial, not the ulnar, artery.
The radial artery was larger than the ulnar artery and was the major source of blood supply to the forearm.
Clinical implications for single superficial forearm arteries are reviewed.
A person with both superficial radial and superficial ulnar arteries would be at a substantially increased risk of injury or iatrogenic effects that could compromise blood supply to the hand.
This study will enhance clinician's awareness of potential arterial variations, so they can provide adequate assessment, diagnosis and treatment of upper limb lesions.


Abstract
Cancers of the breast, kidney, lungs, prostate and thyroid metastasize to the musculoskeletal system in the majority of patients with malignancy.
This report chronicles the case of a 65-year-old female with a known history of breast cancer who presented to a chiropractic clinic.
Once metastasis was ruled out as the cause of her complaint, the patient was treated with manual therapies and exercises.
Advanced imaging revealed metastasis to the brain and subsequently to the spine.
The aim of this case is to heighten awareness of the presentation of metastasis to the brain and the spine in a chiropractic patient, and to demonstrate the benefit of chiropractic care in the management of such patients.


Abstract
Asthma often starts before six years of age.
This delays treatment and contributes to both short- and long-term morbidity.
In the absence of lung function tests, the diagnosis of asthma should be considered in children one to five years of age with frequent (≥8 days/month) asthma-like symptoms or recurrent (≥2) exacerbations (episodes with asthma-like signs).
The characteristic feature of airflow obstruction is wheezing, commonly accompanied by difficulty breathing and cough.


Abstract
The Canadian Paediatric Society continues to encourage annual influenza vaccination for ALL children and youth ≥6 months of age.
Quadrivalent influenza vaccines are recommended preferentially over trivalent vaccines for use in children and youth.
An adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is now available for use in children six to 23 months of age.


Abstract
It causes significant global morbidity, with an estimated 300 million cases annually.
Although it can affect individuals at any socioeconomic level, individuals who live in poverty or in overcrowded conditions are at much higher risk for scabies.
Lack of local expertise can result in failure to recognize scabies, leading to delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment of cases and contacts.
Scabies disproportionately affects many Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) communities where risk factors are present.
Scabies risk is also higher in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals.
Institutional outbreaks of scabies have also been reported.
Apart from a very itchy rash, scabies can lead to secondary bacterial infections and related complications, as well as to stigmatization, depression, insomnia and significant financial costs.
Topical antiscabies lotions are still the mainstay of treatment, but oral ivermectin has also proven effective under certain circumstances.
Asymptomatic and symptomatic household members should all be treated at the same time.
In Canada and globally, the presence of scabies is usually a symptom of poor living conditions and a sign that basic necessities need improvement.
Clinicians who work with Indigenous communities can improve their ability to diagnose and treat scabies, and should advocate for better living conditions where scabies is prevalent.


Abstract
Housing affects the health of children and youth.
One-third of households in Canada live in substandard conditions or in housing need.
The present statement reviews the literature documenting the impacts of housing on personal health and the health care system.
Types of housing need are defined, including unsuitable or crowded housing, unaffordable housing and inadequate housing, or housing in need of major repairs.
Canada is the only G8 country without a national housing strategy.


Abstract
We review the publicly-available evidence on medical travel.


Abstract
Chinese policy-makers need to maintain the recent decline in the prevalence of tuberculosis, while revising control policies to cope with an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis and the effects of ongoing health reform.
Health reforms are expected to shift patients from tuberculosis dispensaries to designated hospitals.
We developed a mathematical model of tuberculosis control in China to help set appropriate targets and prioritize interventions that might be implemented in the next 10 years.
This model indicates that, even under the most optimistic scenario - improved treatment in tuberculosis dispensaries, introduction of a new effective regimen for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis and optimal care of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis - the current global targets for tuberculosis are unlikely to be reached.
However, reductions in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis should be feasible.
Our results can inform the planning of tuberculosis control in China.

Abstract
Podoconiosis is an inflammatory disease caused by prolonged contact with irritant minerals in soil.
Major symptoms include swelling of the lower limb (lymphoedema) and acute pain.
The disease has major social and economic consequences through stigma and loss of productivity.
In the last five years there has been good progress in podoconiosis research and control.
Addressing poverty at household level and infrastructure development such as roads, water and urbanization can all help to reduce podoconiosis incidence.
Secondary and tertiary prevention are based on the management of the lymphoedema-related morbidity and include foot hygiene, foot care, wound care, compression, exercises, elevation of the legs and treatment of acute infections.
Certain endemic countries are taking the initiative to include podoconiosis in their national plans for the control of neglected tropical diseases and to scale up interventions against the disease.
Advocacy is needed for provision of shoes as a health intervention.
We suggest case definitions and elimination targets as a starting point for elimination of the disease.


Abstract
Many countries struggle to develop and implement strategies to monitor hospitals nationally.
The challenge is particularly acute in low-income countries where resources for measurement and reporting are scarce.
We examined the experience of developing and implementing a national system for monitoring the performance of 130 government hospitals in Ethiopia.
The development and implementation of the system, which required technical and political investment and support, would not have been possible without strong hospital-level management capacity.
Thorough assessment of the health sector's readiness to change and desire to prioritize hospital quality can be helpful in the early stages of design and implementation.
This assessment may include interviews with key informants, collection of data about health facilities and human resources and discussion with academic partners.
Aligning partners and donors with the government's vision for quality improvement can enhance acceptability and political support.
Such alignment can enable resources to be focused strategically towards one national effort - rather than be diluted across dozens of potentially competing projects.


Abstract
This review summarizes the current status of the small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) procedure.
Following the early work by Sekundo et al. and Shah et al.
, SMILE has become increasingly popular.
A number of studies have demonstrated a lower reduction and faster recovery of corneal sensation after SMILE than LASIK.
Some studies have also used confocal microscopy to demonstrate a lower decrease in subbasal nerve fiber density after SMILE than LASIK.
The potential biomechanical advantages of SMILE have been modeled by Reinstein et al. based on the non-linearity of tensile strength through the stroma.
, and a new procedure referred to as endokeratophakia in which a myopic SMILE lenticule is implanted into a hyperopic patient (Pradhan et al.).
Finally, studies reporting microdistortions in Bowman's layer and corneal wound healing responses are also described.


Abstract
Although pregnancy often motivates women to quit smoking, 20% to 25% will continue to smoke.
Smoking is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes such as placental abruption, stillbirth, preterm birth and sudden infant death syndrome, and it is therefore important to motivate women to quit during pregnancy.
In this review, we explore the efficacy and evidence for safety of strategies for smoking cessation in pregnancy, including behavioural and pharmacologic therapies.
Studies were selected based on the levels of evidence presented by the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care.
Nicotine replacement therapy administered in the form of gum may be better than using transdermal forms to avoid high levels of nicotine in the fetal circulation.
One small trial demonstrated that bupropion is an effective aid for smoking cessation and that it does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations.
The currently available studies of varenicline in pregnancy are insufficient to provide evidence for the safety or efficacy of its use.


Abstract
A Health Canada group responsible for maternal and child health surveillance built on the results of this study.


Abstract
Child maltreatment surveillance: enumeration, monitoring, evaluation and insight.
Definitions of abuse and neglect differ within and across countries, obscuring estimates of the true magnitude of the problem.
Definitions also vary depending on the nature of the child protection system.
Underreporting of CAN results in underestimates of prevalence.
Social stigma and unintended consequences of reporting, as well as cultural and political barriers, also impact reporting both within communities and globally.


Abstract
The Nurse-Family Partnership: evidence-based public health in response to child maltreatment.
Retrospective data indicates that 32% of Canadian adults have experienced childhood abuse.
There is evidence that child maltreatment is associated with a wide array of negative health consequences across the life span.
These consequences expand across physical, mental, developmental and social domains to include suicide, substance abuse, anxiety, depression and physical health problems.
Experts have asked for coordinated national leadership in protecting children from maltreatment.
They also envision broadening the mandate for injury prevention to include not only physical injury but also emotional injury and harm.


Abstract
Adapting and retesting evidence-based child maltreatment prevention programs: a case study in Canada.
Recent national surveys of violence against children conducted in Africa and in other low- and middle-income countries reveal rates of childhood physical, sexual and emotional abuse even higher than the global rates.


Abstract
In this review, we provide basic facts about maternity care services within the health care system in Russia.
We give a short overview of such key aspects as the demographic situation, reproductive behaviour, regulatory framework for providing health care for women and children, maternal and perinatal mortality, and the availability of medical personnel.
A three-level system of specialized medical care has been introduced in Russia for women and newborns during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.
The total number of midwives is 62 000, providing a ratio of 8.1 midwives per 10 000 women.
In recent years we have succeeded in optimizing the maternity care system by increasing its accessibility and quality.


Abstract
The International Conference on Population and Development and Millennium Development Goals propelled reproductive health into priorities for international development through declarations, statements, and frameworks.
However, key indicators demonstrate that progress in both service provision and clinical outcomes has not been optimal, especially for certain disadvantaged groups.
With the Sustainable Development Goals, efforts over the next two decades will focus on access to and quality of health services.
Advocacy for mobilizing resources will be complemented by accountability, especially monitoring and evaluation, for utilization of these resources during the life cycle.
Stakeholders should emphasize national commitments, with broad partnerships, to ensure long-term sustainability.


Abstract
Maternal mortality is high in many low- and middle-income countries.
Unsafe anaesthesia contributes to this, especially for women requiring Caesarean section.
A new course called SAFE-OB teaches a systematic approach to anticipating, preparing for, and dealing with obstetric anaesthetic emergencies.
The course has now been taught in many African, Asian, and Latin countries.
Initial follow-up suggests improvement in skills and knowledge, and effective translation of these to the workplace.
Efforts are made to make the course locally owned and sustainable.
We feel that SAFE-OB is an effective method of improving obstetric anaesthesia care.


Abstract
Many risk factors have been identified, and diagnostic and management tools have improved in recent years.
However, this disease remains one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in under-resourced settings.
A history of previous preeclampsia is a known risk factor for a new event in a future pregnancy, with recurrence rates varying from less than 10% to 65%, depending on the population or methodology considered.
It is always challenging to treat and counsel a woman with a previous history of preeclampsia; this review will be based on hypothetical clinical cases, using common scenarios in obstetrical practice to consider the available evidence on how to counsel each woman during pre-conception and prenatal consultations.


Abstract
Maternal death surveillance and response (MDSR) is one of several low cost, high impact strategies to reduce maternal mortality.
This initiative is supported in eastern and southern Africa by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and other partners.
Currently, South Africa is the leading country in the institutionalization of MDSR through the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD).
The report from the knowledge-sharing meeting and the findings of the evaluation of the South African MDSR show that MDSR is still not at an optimal level in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the efforts of national authorities and support from a number of development partners.


Abstract
Vaginal birth after Caesarean section (VBAC) has long been practised in low resource settings using unconventional methods.
This not only poses danger to the woman and her baby, but could also have serious legal and ethical implications.
Since a reduction in rates of Caesarean section may not be applicable in these regions, because their rates are already low, the emphasis should instead be on adequate birth spacing and safer primary operative delivery.


Abstract
Danazol has been used in the treatment of endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding for more than 40 years.
This medication has both central antigonadotropic actions and direct atrophic effects on endometriotic tissue.
Although it demonstrates a high-efficacy profile, the associated side effects have resulted in limited usage.
Vaginal administration of the drug may prove favourable specifically in rectovaginal endometriosis.
This targeted mode of delivery is associated with a significant reduction in both pain symptoms and nodule size.
The relative persistence of these therapeutic benefits is likely related to the direct tissue effects after absorption through the vaginal mucosa.
Vaginal administration would also limit systemic propagation of danazol and thus should minimize androgenic side effects.
Use of vaginal danazol also improves heavy menstrual bleeding and may even restore fertility in some patients.
In this review we provide a critical analysis of the existing literature on the use of vaginal danazol.


Abstract
This curriculum must also reflect the unique realities of the specialty's practice.
The Dutch curriculum represents a practical example of how such a program could be developed.
Several CBME curricular initiatives have now also begun across Canada.


Abstract
Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a known complication of the large-volume resuscitation that burn patients receive.
Bowel ischemia has been theorized to occur in ACS but has yet to be described in the literature.
The authors report an occurrence of late bowel obstruction related to ACS-associated bowel ischemia in a burn patient.
A four-year-old previously well girl sustained 70% total body surface area burns with inhalation injury.
The areas injured were the anterior neck, circumferential torso from neck to waist, left arm, left thigh and two-thirds of her right thigh.
Fluid resuscitation was initially administered using the modified Parkland formula.
Her transfer to the regional burn unit from a local hospital was complicated by early septic shock from a line infection, which increased her resuscitation fluid requirements.
Infection ultimately led to multiple instances of ACS.
Intervention with percutaneous drainage led to immediate improvement; however, the episodes of ACS resulted in a late small bowel obstruction secondary to stricture, requiring a laparotomy and bowel resection.


Abstract
In cases of median nerve injury alongside an unsalvageable ulnar nerve, a vascularized ulnar nerve graft to reconstruct the median nerve is a viable option.
While restoration of median nerve sensation is consistently reported, recovery of significant motor function is less frequently observed.
Long-term follow-up showed near full fist, with 12 kg of grip strength, key pinch with 1.5 kg of strength and protective sensation in the median nerve distribution.


Abstract
Maintaining quality, competitiveness and innovation in global health technology is a constant challenge for manufacturers, while affordability, access and equity are challenges for governments and international agencies.
In this paper we discuss these issues with reference to rapid diagnostic tests for malaria.
Strategies to control and eliminate malaria depend on early and accurate diagnosis.
Rapid diagnostic tests for malaria require little training and equipment and can be performed by non-specialists in remote settings.
Use of these tests has expanded significantly over the last few years, following recommendations to test all suspected malaria cases before treatment and the implementation of an evaluation programme to assess the performance of the malaria rapid diagnostic tests.
Despite these gains, challenges exist that, if not addressed, could jeopardize the progress made to date.


Abstract
No single option is sufficient to tackle all the challenges associated with antimicrobial resistance.
There are three policy components to the problem of antimicrobials--ensuring access, conservation and innovation.


Abstract
We present our recent experience with one patient suffering from ACS secondary to burn injury and the physiologic results of abdominal wall escharotomy.


Abstract
Hand burns in children are frequent, severe, and require adequate treatment.
A fundamental, though problematic aspect of this treatment is the assessment of the burn depth as this determines the surgical strategy.
From a retrospective study of 369 hand burns admitted to our clinic, we were able to identify some patterns.
A total of 14.91% required surgery, with varying etiology among these patients.
Differences were also noticed in the number of days post-burn prior to surgical intervention.
The patterns revealed by our results are reviewed in order to improve therapeutic strategy.


Abstract
Once resuscitative measures are optimized and hemodynamic stability is achieved, early burn debridement and coverage is performed.
These significant patient morbidities are often amenable to free tissue transfer as well.


Abstract
Burn scars still represent a challenge to the reconstructive surgeon.
Their management requires a specific expertise and set up involving the possibility of long term rehabilitation and follow up.
Cases encountered in humanitarian missions present additional issues.
Often the local environment is not suitable for an appropriate treatment plan, requiring the case to be transferred to a foreign country for surgical care as part of an integrated international and multidisciplinary management.


Abstract
In Italy the economic crisis has caused changes in behavior in daily as well as leisure activities.
For instance, night clubs have changed both their scenography and what they can offer.
From simply providing a place to dance, they can now offer more complex scenography with spectacular fireworks and lit cocktails.
While this can be amazing for all of us it can also be another cause of burn injuries.
We conducted a retrospective study of all burns patients admitted to the Accident and Emergency Department at CTO Hospital in Turin from 2009 to 2013, after a night clubbing.
A total of five patients were identified with an average age of 20 years old: four were burned by flaming cocktails and one was burned by a firework.
Two received outpatient treatment, while orotracheal intubation and admission were needed for three, and two required surgical debridement and resurfacing with split skin graft.
All patients had permanent sequelae caused by pathologic scarring and/or dyschromia.
Our findings show that the risk of burn injuries is higher at weekends, mainly in summer, if all correct safety procedures are not followed.
Meanwhile it is important to highlight that the promotion of inappropriate behavior at night clubs during firework displays and the passing of flaming cocktails should be avoided.


Abstract
In Switzerland it is customary to light candles on Christmas trees and advent wreaths.
This tradition leads to an increased risk of home fires.
We reviewed the records of patients who sustained burn injuries from a lit Christmas tree or advent wreath during the Christmas holidays between January 1971 and January 2012.
We treated 28 patients and observed 4 fatalities (mortality rate: 14%).
61% of the patients were male, 39% were female.
The mean abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) was 6.5 points in the group of the survivors and 10.8 points in the group of the non-survivors.
The mean total body surface area burned (TBSA) for survivors was 18.9%, with 14.1% having full thickness burns; for the non-survivors the mean TBSA was 45.2%, with 38% having full thickness burns.
The Mann-Whitney U-test showed a significant difference between the survivors and the fatalities concerning the mean total and full thickness burned body surface area (p value 0.009 and 0.012).
More than sixty percent of the fires occurred in January and the most severe accidents were seen after January 4th.
Despite Christmas decoration-associated fires being relatively uncommon, they tend to cause more serious injuries than regular household fires.
We recommend that in countries where it is customary to set up flammable Christmas decorations, state-issued information pamphlets with instructions on fire safety conduct should be distributed.


Abstract
Vaccination is a useful option to control infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and several modified live-PRRSV vaccines have been developed.
These vaccines have shown some efficacy in reducing the incidence and severity of clinical disease as well as the duration of viremia and virus shedding but have failed to provide sterilizing immunity.
The efficacy of modified live-virus (MLV) vaccines is greater against a homologous strain compared with heterologous PRRSV strains.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Fostera PRRS MLV vaccine in protecting against challenge with a heterologous field strain widely circulating in the swine herds of eastern Canada.
Forty-six piglets were divided into 4 groups: nonvaccinated-nonchallenged; nonvaccinated-challenged; vaccinated-challenged; and vaccinated-nonchallenged.
The animals were vaccinated at 23 d of age with Fostera PRRS and challenged 23 d later with a heterologous field strain of PRRSV (FMV12-1425619).
Overall, the vaccine showed some beneficial effects in the challenged animals by reducing the severity of clinical signs and the viral load.
A significant difference between nonvaccinated and vaccinated animals was detected for some parameters starting 11 to 13 d after challenge, which suggested that the cell-mediated immune response or other delayed responses could be more important than pre-existing PRRSV antibodies in vaccinated animals within the context of protection against heterologous strains.

However, there is limited information on the acceptable duration of transport and temperature during transport of samples.


Abstract
Rumen fluid samples were collected from each animal by rumenocentesis in 3 periods: 1 d (T1), 8 d (T8), and 15 d (T15) after treatment.
Rumen pH was determined by ruminal fluid using portable pH meter.
Total volatile fatty acids (total VFA) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
All animals were singularly weighed at T1 and T15.


Abstract
Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and metastasis dissemination.
We investigated whether the contrasting metastatic behavior of feline and canine osteosarcoma is related to levels and activities of MMP2 and MMP9.
Zymography and immunohistochemistry were used to determine expression levels of MMP2 and MMP9 in canine and feline osteosarcoma.
Using immunohistochemistry, increased MMP9 levels were identified in most canine osteosarcomas, whereas cat samples more often displayed moderate levels.
High levels of pro-MMP9, pro-MMP2, and active MMP2 were detected by gelatin zymography in both species, with significantly higher values for active MMP2 in canine osteosarcoma.
These findings indicate that MMP2 is probably involved in canine and feline osteosarcoma and their expression and activity could be associated with the different metastatic behavior of canine and feline osteosarcoma.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate the normal cytological evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in healthy adult ferrets (N = 12).
These ferrets underwent bronchoscopy and BAL using sterile saline [1.5 mL/kg body weight (BW)].
The mean percentage of lavage volume recovered from the right lung and left lung were 67.8 ± 14.9% and 69.7 ± 20.0%, respectively.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of 3 distinct preparations of ketamine and xylazine, with or without acepromazine, stored at room temperature or at 4°C for 1, 2, and 3 mo.
Drug concentrations were compared to fresh solutions, using a high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/selected-ion monitoring (HPLC-MS/SIM) assay.
Storage at 4°C could preserve drug stability.


Abstract
Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) regulates cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues.
We found no significant differences in serum GDF11 levels between dogs at different stages of CMVI-associated heart failure.
Furthermore, the circulating levels of GDF11 did not correlate with age, body weight, echocardiographic variables, and the severity of CMVI-induced heart failure in dogs.


Abstract
Although immunization has decreased the incidence of bacterial pneumonia in vaccinated children, pneumonia remains common in healthy children.
Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia frequently overlap those present with viral infections or reactive airway disease.
Factors such as age, vital signs and other measures of illness severity are critical when deciding whether to admit a patient to hospital.


Abstract
Reducing blood loss and the need for blood transfusions in extremely preterm infants is part of effective care.
Delayed cord clamping is well supported by the evidence and is recommended for infants who do not immediately require resuscitation.
In view of concerns regarding the increased risk for cognitive delay, clinicians should avoid using hemoglobin transfusion thresholds lower than those tested in clinical trials.
Higher transfusion volumes (15 mL/kg to 20 mL/kg) may decrease exposure to multiple donors.
Erythropoietin is not recommended for routine use due to concerns about retinopathy of prematurity.
Elemental iron supplementation (2 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day once full oral feeds are achieved) is recommended to prevent later iron deficiency anemia.
Noninvasive monitoring (eg, for carbon dioxide, bilirubin) and point-of-care testing reduce the need for blood sampling.
Clinicians should strive to order the minimal amount of blood sampling required for safe patient care, and cluster samplings to avoid unnecessary skin breaks.


Abstract
Hypereosinophilia is usually defined as a blood eosinophil count >1500/μL.
Albendazole was empirically administered in all three cases, with complete normalization of eosinophil counts thereafter.
Empirical treatment with albendazole for patients presenting with hypereosinophilia should be strongly considered.


Abstract
Health-care providers' perception of knowledge, skills and preparedness for disaster management in primary health-care centres in Jordan.
This survey in primary health-care centres in north Jordan aimed to assess health-care providers' perceptions of their knowledge, skills and preparedness for disaster management.
A multistage random sample was used to recruit nurses and physicians from 57 health centres.
A total of 207 participants completed the Arabic version of the Disaster Preparedness Evaluation Tool.
Participants perceived themselves as having moderate preparation for disaster management [mean score 74.9 (SD 21.6)], moderate knowledge [mean 49.9 (SD 12.3)] and moderate to weak skills in disaster management [mean 35.3 (SD 12.7)].
Significant differences were revealed in participants' perceptions of their disaster preparedness, knowledge and skills according to their sex, specialty and exposure to a real disaster situation.
Further education and training courses are needed to enhance providers' preparedness for disaster management in Jordan.


Abstract
Reliability and known-group validity of the Arabic version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
No validation study has previously been made for the Arabic version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8(©)) as a measure for medication adherence in diabetes.
This study in 2013 tested the reliability and validity of the Arabic MMAS-8 for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients attending a referral centre in Tripoli, Libya.
A convenience sample of 103 patients self-completed the questionnaire.
Reliability was tested using Cronbach alpha, average inter-item correlation and Spearman-Brown coefficient.
Known-group validity was tested by comparing MMAS-8 scores of patients grouped by glycaemic control.
The Arabic version showed adequate internal consistency (α = 0.70) and moderate split-half reliability (r = 0.65).
Known-group validity was supported as a significant association was found between medication adherence and glycaemic control, with a moderate effect size (ϕc = 0.34).
The Arabic version displayed good psychometric properties and could support diabetes research and practice in Arab countries.


Abstract
Are insulin analogues an unavoidable necessity for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in developing countries?
The case of Jordan.
Despite their reported benefits in terms of glycaemic control, insulin analogues are expensive for patients in developing countries.
This study in Jordan aimed to compare the effectiveness and adverse events of premixed human insulin (BHI30) versus premixed insulin analogue (BIAsp30) in patients with type 2 diabetes.
In a retrospective cohort study from October 2012 to March 2013, outcomes (HbA1c, weight, hypoglycaemia and lipohypertrophy) were compared at baseline and 6 months after treatment in 628 patients.
BHI30 produced a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c than did BIAsp30.
This difference in HbA1c remained significant after controlling for the effects of age, sex, duration of diabetes, body mass index and hypoglycaemia (β-coefficient was -0.18 in favour of BHI30).
Weight gain and mild hypoglycaemia was significantly higher with BHI30 than with BIAsp30.


Abstract
Epidemiological status of leishmaniasis in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1983-2012.
Leishmaniasis has a long history in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study aimed to show the trend in leishmaniasis incidence from 1983 to 2012 and to describe the epidemiological characteristics in 2012.
In a retrospective cross-sectional study, data were extracted from th%e national leishmaniasis surveillance system for the 3 clinical types-cutaneous (zoonotic and anthroponotic) and visceral (zoonotic).
The average annual number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases was 18 884 (average annual incidence 32 cases per 100 000 inhabitants).
In 2012 the highest incidences were in age groups 1-4 and 5-9-years (43 and 40 per 100 000), and more males (57%) than females (43%) were infected.
The annual average number of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis cases was 175 (average annual incidence 0.18 per 100 000).
The incidences of cutaneous and zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis have decreased in recent years, which coincides with national leishmaniasis control efforts.


Abstract
Social capital of Iranian patients living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and associated factors.
This study investigated the social capital of Iranian patients living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the associated factors.
In a cross-sectional study the Integrated Social Capital Questionnaire was filled by a sequential sample of 300 patients visiting a referral counselling centre in Tehran.
The patients' social capital scores were around 50% in the trust, social cohesion, collective action and cooperation and political empowerment domains.
The groups and networks membership domain scored the lowest (27.1%).
Efforts are needed to enhance the social capital of those patients living with AIDS who are younger, unemployed, divorced/widowed, with risky behaviours and shorter disease awareness.


Abstract
Assessment of the nutritional status of residents in homes for the elderly in Lattakia, Syrian Arab Republic.
Malnutrition is common among residents of homes for the elderly.
This study aimed to identify the nutritional status of people in residential homes for the elderly in Lattakia, Syrian Arab Republic, and to determine the factors that affected nutritional status in these homes.
A total of 103 elderly people in 3 residential homes were interviewed individually using an Arabic version of the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scale, and anthropometric measurements were carried out to assess nutritional status.
The mean age was 70.9 (SD 6.4) years.
Two-thirds of residents were either at risk of malnutrition (39.8%; score 17-23 on the MNA) or malnourished (19.4%; score < 17 on the MNA).
Mean body mass index was 22.0 (SD 4.7) kg/m(2).
Nutritional status was significantly affected by age, level of education, source of income, duration of stay in the home, number of diseases, number of medicines taken, anthropometric data and teeth and vision problems.


Abstract
Functional and prognostic relevance of -173 G/C gene polymorphism of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in sepsis patients in Egyptian intensive care units.
This study aimed to evaluate the association of plasma MIF level and -173 G/C single nucleotide polymorphism of the MIF gene with the occurrence, severity and mortality of sepsis patients.
A study was conducted in adult surgical intensive care units of Zagazig University Hospitals, Egypt on 25 patients with sepsis, 27 with severe sepsis and 28 controls.
Gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolates in both severe sepsis (63.0%) and sepsis (56.0%) patients.
A highly statistically significant difference was found in MIF levels between sepsis cases and controls and a statistically significant difference as regards MIF level in different genotypes of the studied groups.
MIF level was significantly associated with mortality in sepsis cases.
High MIF levels and MIF -173G/C gene polymorphism are powerful predictors of the severity of sepsis and its outcome.


Abstract
Cattle movement as a risk factor for epidemics.
Cattle movement is one of the most important risk factors for the occurrence of an epidemic.
Using this data we examined all movements, focusing on the geographical distribution of these movements in relation to the spread of epizootic diseases.
We considered the period 01 January 2011 through 30 January 2012, in which a total of 786'462 cattle were moved.
Furthermore, we found that there were more cattle movements in summer than in winter, due to movements of cattle to and from alpine pastures.
There were also prominent regional differences.
On the first day after the arrival of a cattle there was a minimum of zero and a maximum of 99'168 possible transfers of an infectious agent.
Nevertheless, in most cases there were no cattle moved on the first day following the arrival of a cattle (91.4%).


Abstract
Many health care workers lack access to clinical support tools in rural and resource-limited settings.
These findings show that mobile apps can be used to disseminate health information effectively.


Abstract
Seven (11%) had secured further research funding and 22 (35%) stated that their institutions were involved in implementation or capacity building in operational research.
Significant research output continues beyond course completion, further endorsing the value of the SORT IT model.


Abstract
Moreover, the systems overlapped to a considerable extent, thereby entailing a duplication of effort.
In 2013, the Chinese Government combined these two systems into an integrated national mortality surveillance system to provide a provincially representative picture of total and cause-specific mortality and to accelerate the development of a comprehensive vital registration and mortality surveillance system for the whole country.
This new system increased the surveillance population from 6 to 24% of the Chinese population.
The number of surveillance points, each of which covered a district or county, increased from 161 to 605.
To ensure representativeness at the provincial level, the 605 surveillance points were selected to cover China's 31 provinces using an iterative method involving multistage stratification that took into account the sociodemographic characteristics of the population.
This paper describes the development and operation of the new national mortality surveillance system, which is expected to yield representative provincial estimates of mortality in China for the first time.


Abstract
Researchers identify practical problems facing public health programmes and aim to find solutions that improve health outcomes.
In operational research, routinely-collected programme data are used to uncover ways of delivering more effective, efficient and equitable health care.
As implementation research can address many types of questions, many research designs may be appropriate.
This is an evolving field, so we plan to monitor the use of these guidelines and develop future versions as required.


Abstract
In order to fit the paternal DNA into the tiny spermatozoa head, complete chromatin remodeling is necessary.
This review essentially focuses on present knowledge of this mammalian sperm nucleus compaction program.


Abstract
In this article, we review the published literature and present an illustrative series of 4 consecutive cases of early internal hernia through a pelvic mesh defect.
These meshes were placed to prevent perineal hernias after laparoscopic or robotic APRs.
The discussion centres on 3 key questions: Should one be placing a pelvic mesh following an APR?
What are some of the technical details pertaining to the initial mesh placement?
What are the management options related to internal hernias through such a mesh?


Abstract
For several decades, testosterone and its synthetic derivatives have been used with anabolic and androgenic purposes.
Substance abuse, including AAS, is commonly associated to transient or persistent impairment on male reproductive function, through different pathways.


Abstract
Prevalence of risk factors for noncommunicable diseases in Jalalabad city, Afghanistan, evaluated using the WHO STEPwise approach.
Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are a growing public health challenge.
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of common risk factors for NCDs among the adult population an urban setting in the eastern province of Nangarhar, Afghanistan.
In a randomized, cluster sample survey of households the WHO STEPwise method was modified and used to collect demographic, behavioural and clinical data from 1200 adults (61% females) in Jalalabad in 2013.
Blood samples were collected for biochemical testing.
The prevalence of overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension were 57.4%, 11.4% and 24.4% respectively.
Among respondents, 8.0% reported being current cigarette smokers and 13.7% used mouth snuff; 69.8% and 19.6% had < 3 servings of fruits and of vegetables respectively in a week; and 33.5% and 57.8% reported vigorous and moderate physical activity respectively.
Tailored interventions on risk factors of NCDs are needed in urban areas in Afghanistan.


Abstract
Compliance with and knowledge about diabetes guidelines among physicians and nurses in Palestine.
Guidelines for the care of patients with diabetes mellitus are believed to improve clinical practice and patient care.
Questionnaires were used to collect data from 401 participants in 3 governorates in the West Bank.
In total, 46.0% of participants knew about the existence of the Palestinian guidelines and about 60% believed these were partially used; 32.7% had received training on implementation of the guidelines.
Multivariate analysis showed that training on the guidelines was the only factor significantly associated with self-reported compliance with guideline use.
Respondents reported high commitment to the use of the guidelines, but their attitudes and behaviour varied with time constraints, availability of the guidelines, availability of laboratory tests and training on how to apply the guidelines.


Abstract
Study of prevalence and effects of insulin resistance in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4.
There is strong epidemiological evidence linking hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and diabetes.
Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of insulin resistance in Egyptian patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection, to assess factors associated with insulin resistance and to test the impact of insulin resistance on outcomes of treatment with pegylated interferon/ribavirin.
Insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessmentinsulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score > 3.0] was detected in 31 of 100 nondiabetic patients.
The relationship between elevated HOMA-IR and baseline viral load and degree of fibrosis was statistically significant (r = 0.218 and r = 0.223).
Follow-up of patients with complete early virological response until the end of treatment showed a statistically significant decrease in HOMA-IR score.
Out of 29 liver tissue sections examined, 14 had a low level of expression of insulin receptor type 1 by immunohistochemical studies.


Abstract
Trauma research in Qatar: a literature review and discussion of progress after establishment of a trauma research centre.
A structured research programme is one of the main pillars of a trauma care system.
Despite the high rate of injury-related mortalities, especially road traffic accidents, in Qatar, little consideration has been given to research in trauma.
This review aimed to analyse research publications on the subject of trauma published from Qatar and to discuss the progress of clinical research in Qatar and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries with special emphasis on trauma research.
A literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines located 757 English-language articles within the fields of internal medicine, surgery and trauma originating from Qatar between the years 1993 and 2013.
A steep increase in the number of trauma publications since 2010 could be linked to the setting up of a trauma research centre in Qatar in 2011.
We believe that establishing a research unit has made a major impact on research productivity, which ultimately benefits health care.


Abstract
Socioeconomic inequality and child maltreatment in Iranian schoolchildren.
Socioeconomic inequality and child maltreatment have not been studied using the concentration index as an indicator of inequality.
The study aimed to assess the association of child maltreatment with socioeconomic status among schoolchildren in Qazvin province, Islamic Republic of Iran.
In this cross-sectional study a questionnaire based on the ISPCAN Child Maltreatment Screening Tool-Children's Version and the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire was filled by 1028 children aged 9-14 years, selected through multistage stratified random sampling.
The concentration indices for economic inequality were -0.086 for any type of child maltreatment and -0.155, -0.098 and -0.139 for the physical, psychological and neglect subtypes of maltreatment respectively.
The number of children and the economic status of the family also showed a significant association with child maltreatment in all 3 subtypes.
Appropriate planning for effective interventions for at-risk children of lower socioeconomic status should be considered by the relevant decision-makers.


Abstract
Antibiogram of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from clinical specimens at King Hussein Medical Centre, Jordan: a retrospective analysis.
This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and the local antibiogram of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates in Al-Hussein Hospital at King Hussein Medical Centre in Amman, Jordan.
In a retrospective study from January to December 2013, data on 116 non-repetitive positive clinical samples were retrieved from patients' laboratory records.
The resistance rates of A. baumannii isolates were high for ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ticarcillin (100%), ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin (98.3%), imipenem (97.4%), piperacillin/tazobactam (96.6%), quinolones (94.8%), ampicillin/sulbactam (89.7%), gentamicin, (87.9%), tobramycin and tetracycline (76.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (75.9%), but lower for minocycline (26.7%) and colistin (1.7%).
A. baumannii in our hospital were highly resistant to all antibiotics, including tigecycline, except for minocycline and colistin which are considered the last resort treatment for multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.


Abstract
Ageing and intergenerational family ties in Arab countries.
The data were drawn from a review of scholarly work and published literature in Arab countries and from a regional mapping of ageing policies and programmes in 2012.
Social and health ageing policies in the region have been set with the premise that the family represents the core safety net for older Arabs.
Yet demographic, sociocultural and economic transitions, as well as political conflict in the Arab world, are bringing profound changes to familial structures.


Abstract
Our paper presents the development process for these guidelines.
A group of national and international experts was formed and a national situation analysis for tobacco dependence treatment practices and a detailed review of international evidence were conducted.
The guidelines were then drafted and reviewed by national, regional and international experts and were official endorsed by the Jordanian Ministry of Health before being launched.
The guidelines comprise concise descriptions and practical supplementary flowcharts covering the major elements of general tobacco dependence treatment.
These are the first comprehensive Arabic-language guidelines, including a section focusing on waterpipe use, and we believe they are a reliable and useful resource for neighbouring countries seeking to develop similar guidelines.


Abstract
Preclinical animal models of psychiatric disorders are of critical importance for advances in development of new psychiatric medicine.
Regrettably, behavior-only models have yielded no novel targeted treatments during the past half-century of vigorous deployment.
This supposition is wrong-to the extent that the rewarding and punishing aspects of emotion circuit arousals reflect positive and negative affective states.
All have progressed to successful human testing.
For optimal progress, it may be useful for preclinical investigators to focus on the evolved affective foundations of psychiatrically relevant brain emotional disorders for optimal animal modeling.


Abstract
This paper argues that studies of mental health and wellbeing can be contextualized within an evolutionary approach that highlights the coregulating processes of emotions and motives.


Abstract
Emotional processes are central to behavior, yet their deeply subjective nature has been a challenge for neuroscientific study as well as for psychiatric diagnosis.
Here we explore the relationships between subjective feelings and their underlying brain circuits from a computational perspective.
We apply recent insights from systems neuroscience-approaching subjective behavior as the result of mental computations instantiated in the brain-to the study of emotions.
We develop the hypothesis that emotions are the product of neural computations whose motor role is to reallocate bodily resources mostly gated by smooth muscles.
This "emotor" control system is analagous to the more familiar motor control computations that coordinate skeletal muscle movements.
To illustrate this framework, we review recent research on "confidence."
Although familiar as a feeling, confidence is also an objective statistical quantity: an estimate of the probability that a hypothesis is correct.
This model-based approach helped reveal the neural basis of decision confidence in mammals and provides a bridge to the subjective feeling of confidence in humans.
These results have important implications for psychiatry, since disorders of confidence computations appear to contribute to a number of psychopathologies.
More broadly, this computational approach to emotions resonates with the emerging view that psychiatric nosology may be best parameterized in terms of disorders of the cognitive computations underlying complex behavior.


Abstract
However, emotions themselves are complex phenomena that are composed of multiple subprocesses.
We consider the implications of these intersecting trajectories for negative outcomes such as psychopathology, as well as positive outcomes for adolescent social bonds.


Abstract
Clinical psychopathology has largely ignored the developments in the field of social neuroscience.
The so-called moral emotions are a group of affective experiences thought to promote cooperation, group cohesion, and reorganization.
In this review, we: (i) briefly describe a provisional taxonomy of a limited set of moral emotions and their neural underpinnings; and (ii) discuss how disgust, guilt, anger/indignation, and shame/embarrassment can be conceptualized as key affective experiences in different neuropsychiatric disorders.
We hope this stimulates new empirical work exploring how moral emotional changes and their underlying neurobiology can help elucidating the neural underpinnings of mental disorders.


Abstract
We highlight unique disturbances in each disorder that may involve dissociable neural systems, but also possible interactions between affect and cognition in MD versus SCZ.
Finally, we review computational and translational approaches that offer mechanistic insight into how cellular-level disruptions can lead to complex affective disturbances, informing development of therapies across MD and SCZ.


Abstract
A great deal of human emotion arises in response to real, anticipated, remembered, or imagined rejection by other people.
This article examines seven emotions that often arise when people perceive that their relational value to other people is low or in potential jeopardy, including hurt feelings, jealousy, loneliness, shame, guilt, social anxiety, and embarrassment.
Other emotions, such as sadness and anger, may occur during rejection episodes, but are reactions to features of the situation other than low relational value.


Abstract
Emotions are sometimes revealed through facial expressions.
We also discuss the implications of our results in the study of psychopathologies, and consider several open research questions.


Abstract
Research into emotions has increased in recent decades, especially on the subject of recognition of emotions.
Despite recent progress, studies on human emotions have been hindered by the lack of consensus on an emotion theory suited to examining the dynamic aspects of emotion and its expression.
Studying expression of emotion in patients with mental health conditions for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes will profit from theoretical and methodological progress.


Abstract
The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT), highly conserved during evolution, is an important modulator of social and emotional processes across many species.


Abstract
Advancing health equity to improve health: the time is now.
Health inequities, or avoidable inequalities in health between groups of people, are increasingly recognized and tackled to improve public health.
Research in this area includes documenting and tracking health inequalities, exploring their multidimensional causes, and developing and evaluating ways to address them.
Inequalities can be observed in who is vulnerable to infectious and chronic diseases, the impact of health promotion and disease prevention efforts, how disease progresses, and the outcomes of treatment.
Many programs, policies and projects with potential impacts on health equity and determinants of health have been implemented across Canada.
Recent theoretical and methodological advances in the areas of implementation science and population health intervention research have strengthened our capacity to develop effective interventions.
With the launch of a new health equity series this month, the journals Canada Communicable Disease Report and Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada will continue to reflect and foster analysis of social determinants of health and focus on intervention studies that advance health equity.


Abstract
of dual practice for universal health coverage.
No studies have evaluated the impact of policies on the characteristics of dual practice or implications for UHC.
We address this lack and call for case studies of policy interventions on dual practice in different contexts.
Such research requires investment in better data collection and greater determination on the part of researchers, research funding bodies and national research councils to overcome the difficulties of researching sensitive topics of health systems functions.

Abstract
However, anthropometric measures do not always accurately and reliably identify children and youth with obesity-related health risks or comorbidities.
The authors propose a new clinical staging system (the Edmonton Obesity Staging System for Pediatrics, EOSS-P), adapted from the adult-oriented EOSS.
The EOSS-P is used to stratify patients according to severity of obesity-related comorbidities and barriers to weight management into four graded categories (0 to 3) within four main health domains: metabolic, mechanical, mental health and social milieu (the 4Ms).
The EOSS-P is based on common clinical assessments that are widely available and routinely completed by clinicians, and has the potential to provide clinical and prognostic information to help evaluate and inform the management of paediatric obesity.


Abstract
Cannabis is a psychoactive compound with a long history of recreational and therapeutic use.
Smoking is not an acceptable mode of drug delivery for children.
The use of cannabis for medical purposes in specific cases should not be construed as a justification for recreational cannabis use by adolescents.


Abstract
Acute otitis media (AOM) continues to be a common infection in young children.
Milder disease, usually due to viruses or less virulent bacteria, resolves equally quickly with or without antibiotics.
Perforation of the tympanic membrane with purulent discharge similarly indicates a bacterial cause.
For all other cases, parents can be provided with a prescription for antibiotics to fill if the child does not improve in 48 h or the child can be reassessed if this occurs.
Amoxicillin remains the clear drug of choice.
Ten days of therapy is appropriate for children <2 years of age, whereas older children can be treated for five days.

Abstract
To explore associations between the nutritional quality of diet at age 16 years and academic performance in students from Santiago, Chile.
METHODS We assessed the nutritional quality of diet, using a validated food frequency questionnaire, in 395 students aged 16.8 ± 0.5 years.
Depending on the amount of saturated fat, fibre, sugar and salt in the foods, diet was categorized as unhealthy, fair or healthy.
Academic results on or above the 75th percentile in our sample were considered good academic performance.
We tested associations between nutritional quality of diet and good academic performance using logistic regression models.
We considered sociodemographic, educational and body-mass index (BMI) factors as potential confounders.
FINDINGS After controlling for potential confounding factors, an unhealthy diet at age 16 years was associated with reduced academic performance.
Compared to participants with healthy diets, those with unhealthy diets were significantly less likely to perform well based on language tests (odds ratio, OR: 0.42; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.18-0.98) mathematics tests (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.15-0.82) or GPA (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.09-0.56).
CONCLUSION In our sample, excessive consumption of energy-dense, low-fibre, high-fat foods at age 16 years was associated with reduced academic performance.


Abstract
The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was the worst in history with over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths.
Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates.
At the community level, a cyclical pattern of fear occurs, with a loss of trust in health services and stigma, resulting in disruptions of community interactions and community break down.
The outbreak resulted in an increased need for health services, reduced quality of life and economic productivity and social system break down.
Response efforts should involve communities to address psychosocial need, to rebuild health systems and trust and to limit stigma.
The severity of this epidemic and its long-lasting repercussions should spur investment in and development of health systems.


Abstract
Globally, 41% of households, over 2.8 billion people, rely on solid fuels (coal and biomass) for cooking and heating.
In developing countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where these fuels are predominantly used, women who are customarily responsible for cooking, and their young children, are most exposed to the resulting air pollution.
Solid fuels are still in widespread use and it appears that intervention efforts are not keeping pace with population growth in developing countries.
Here we pinpoint the challenges and identify opportunities for addressing household air pollution while mitigating global climate change and promoting the sustainable development goals.


Abstract
Examining health care spending trends over a decade: the Palestinian case.
An analysis was made of recent health care spending patterns in the occupied Palestinian territory, in order to inform future health policy-making and planning.
Data were obtained from the national health accounts for the period 2000-2011.
The current level of resource allocation to the health care sector is higher than in many developed countries and is not sustainable.
The private sector represents the largest source of health financing (61%) and the burden falls disproportionally on individual households, who account for 63% of private health care expenditure.
Key recommendations include: building capacity in the government sector to reduce the outsourcing of health services; modifying inequitable financing mechanisms to reduce the burden on households; and allocating more resources for health promotion and disease prevention programmes.


Abstract
Estimating attributable fraction of lung cancer linked to smoking in Morocco.
The objective of this research was to estimate the attributable fraction (AF) of lung cancer linked to smoking in Morocco.
The estimation was based on the SAMMEC (Adult Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity and Economic Costs) method based on the Levin formula to calculate AF linked to tobacco.
Data about frequencies, association measures and relative risks were taken from available sources.
The AF of lung cancer linked to smoking was about 87%, and around 3049 cases of this cancer in men could be avoided if tobacco use could be prevented.
About a 10% reduction in smoking prevalence would result in a reduction of 346 lung cancer cases.


Abstract
Molecular detection of Leishmania spp. isolated from cutaneous lesions of patients referred to Herat regional hospital, Afghanistan.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is one of the main public health problems in Afghanistan, particularly in Herat.
To identify Leishmania spp., molecular techniques were applied to samples from 64 cutaneous leishmaniasis patients referred to Herat regional hospital during 2013.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the ribosomal RNA gene internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS1) was used.
Most of the patients demonstrated dry type single lesions on the head.
The results of direct microscopy detection using Giemsastained skin scrapings were compared with that of ITS PCR-RFLP for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Light microscopy examination showed 37/64 positive cases (58%).
PCR revealed 50 positive cases (78%), from which ITS PCR-RFLP identified 48 cases (96%) as L. tropica and 2 cases (4%) as L. major.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis in Herat appears to be endemic and of the clinically dry type, caused mainly by L. tropica and occasionally by L. major.


Abstract
Impact of a Baby-Friendly hospital on breastfeeding indicators in Shaqlawa district in Erbil governorate, Kurdistan region of Iraq.
This study aimed to assess the impact of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative on WHO-defined breastfeeding indicators in Shaqlawa district in Kurdistan region of Iraq.
A household survey was carried out on a purposive non-probability sample of 200 mothers with a child aged < 30 months.
Mothers were interviewed using a structured form to determine demographic data and feeding practices of the most recent child.
The rate of early initiation of breastfeeding was 38.1%, exclusive breastfeeding was 15.4% and continued breastfeeding was 61.0% and 39.5% at 1 and 2 years of age respectively.
A significant relationship was found between delivery at the Baby- Friendly accredited hospital and early initiation of breastfeeding but not with exclusive or continued breastfeeding.


Abstract
Validation of the General Self-Efficacy Scale among Qatari young women.
Self-efficacy may be particularly relevant in transitional stages such as in late adolescence, when young people make decisions that will impact their adult lives.
In the present study, we aimed to validate an Arabic version of GSES among 355 Qatari young women aged 18+ years and finishing their final year of high school.
We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to assess the scale dimensionality.
The final model fit was adequate (root mean square error of approximation = 0.07, comparative fit index = 1.00, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.99), confirming a unidimensional self-efficacy measure.
The Qatari Standard Arabic GSES is a reliable tool for measuring general self-efficacy among young Qatari women.


Abstract
Development and validation of a new tool to measure Iranian pregnant women's empowerment.
Empowering pregnant women improves their health and reduces maternal mortality, but there is a lack of suitable tools to measure women's empowerment in some cultures.
This study aimed to design and validate a questionnaire for measuring the dimensions of empowerment among Iranian pregnant women.
After a literature review, and face and content validity testing, a 38-item questionnaire was developed and tested on a sample of 161 pregnant women.
Criterion validity testing showed a strong positive correlation of the total scale and subscales scores with the Kameda and the Spritzer empowerment scales.
Cronbach alpha was 0.92 for total empowerment.


Abstract
Burnout among physicians and nursing staff working in the emergency hospital of Tanta University, Egypt.
Little is known about professional burnout among health-care workers in Egypt.
The current study aimed to reveal the extent of burnout among physicians and nursing staff working in the emergency hospital of Tanta University and to identify some of its determinants.
A cross-sectional study was carried out on all physicians (n = 266) and a systematic random sample of nurses (n = 284).
Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and its subscales.
Most of the participants (66.0%)had a moderate level of burnout and 24.9% of them had high burnout.
Multivariate analysis of variables affecting burnout showed that age, sex, frequency of exposure to work-related violence, years of experience, work burden, supervision and work activities were significant predictors of burnout among the respondents.
The authors recommend health education interventions during pre-employment training programmes for prevention of burnout syndrome and periodic screening for early detection and management of burnout.


Abstract
Youth in crisis in the Middle East and North Africa: a systematic literature review and focused landscape analysis.
Recent political and demographic factors have exposed the vulnerability of the youth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
This study aimed to elucidate the current needs, activities, stakeholders and solutions related to at-risk youth and young adults in the MENA region.
A systematic literature review was conducted of the peer-reviewed and grey literature.
This was complemented by an in-region landscape analysis involving key-informant interviews and focus group discussions.
After extensive screening of 1160 unique articles, 275 articles were considered relevant to this study.
Of these 275, 145 (52.7%) were related to health (64.8% of these related to mental health), 101 (36.7%) to livelihood, 87 (31.6%) to violence prevention and 68 (24.7%) to education.


Abstract
There has been an increase in the incidence of acute pancreatitis reported worldwide.
Despite improvements in access to care, imaging and interventional techniques, acute pancreatitis continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
This underscores the importance of creating understandable and implementable recommendations for the diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis.


Abstract
While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased survival and reduced the number of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) related deaths among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus (PLHIV), HIV/AIDS remains a global health problem and sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the greatest burden of disease.
There are also major challenges in the HIV response: as of December 2013, only 36% of PLHIV globally were on ART, and for every individual started on ART there were two new PLHIV diagnosed.
These discussions are timely, given the recent WHO recommendations advising ART for all PLHIV, regardless of CD4 cell count.


Abstract
In India, to increase tuberculosis (TB) case detection under the National Tuberculosis Programme, active case finding (ACF) was implemented by the Global Fund-supported Project Axshya, among high-risk groups in 300 districts.
Between April 2013 and December 2014, 4.9 million households covering ~20 million people were visited.
Of 350 047 presumptive pulmonary TB cases (cough of ⩾2 weeks) identified, 187 586 (54%) underwent sputum smear examination and 14 447 (8%) were found to be smear-positive.
ACF resulted in the detection of a large number of persons with presumptive pulmonary TB and smear-positive TB.
Ensuring sputum examination of all those with presumptive TB was a major challenge.


Abstract
The South African Ministry of Health has proposed screening all clinic attendees for tuberculosis (TB).
Amongst other factors, male sex and bar attendance are associated with higher TB risk.
The population-level impact of clinic-based screening may be reduced by low coverage among key risk groups.


Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) infection control (IC) is key in controlling TB transmission in health facilities in Lithuania.
This article presents a project that aimed at supporting health care facilities in Lithuania in implementing TB-IC.
The project consisted of 1) facility TB-IC assessments, 2) development of facility TB-IC plans, 3) TB-IC training and 4) site visits.
We assessed the impact of these activities through a self-assessment questionnaire.
The project resulted in limited improvements.
Most progress was seen in administrative and managerial activities.
Possible reasons for the limited improvements are challenges with funding and the lack of supportive legislation and a national TB-IC plan.


Abstract
Tobacco dependence pharmacotherapy (TDP) plays a major role in smoking cessation.
We conducted a rapid assessment of current smoking, availability of TDP and the willingness to quit and to pay for TDP among 56 patients with tobacco-attributable diseases and 38 pharmacies in Uganda.
Of the 56 patients, 63% were current smokers, 77.4% wanted to quit and 37% were willing to pay.
Improving supplies and lowering prices could facilitate access to TDP in Uganda.

Abstract
EHI is caused by abnormal contact between the extra-articular regions of the proximal femur and pelvis.
This review discusses the most common forms for EHI including: central iliopsoas impingement, subspine impingement, ischiofemoral impingement, and greater trochanteric-pelvic impingement.
The clinical presentation of each pathology will be discussed since EHI conditions share similar clinical features as the intra-articular pathology but also contain some unique characteristics.


Abstract
Balancing the assessment of musculoskeletal dysfunctions with a high level of suspicion for non-mechanical origins can be a challenge for the clinician examining a sports injury.
Without timely diagnosis, non-mechanical complaints could result in surgery or loss of limb.
Knee injuries account for 32.6% of sports injuries with PFPS being the most common and most likely diagnosis for anterior knee pain.
GCTB is a benign aggressive bone tumor with a predilection for the juxta-articular region of the knee, comprising up to 23% of all benign bone tumors, and commonly occurs in the second to fourth decades.
This case report illustrates the difficulty in accurately diagnosing healthy athletes, reviews common differentials for knee complaints and explores helpful diagnostic procedures.


Abstract
The objective of this jurisdictional review is to provide summary information pertaining to the regulation of chiropractors in Canadian provinces and territories on the topic of informed consent.
Our review shows that two provinces have legislated for all healthcare professions: Ontario and Prince Edward Island.
Two chiropractic regulatory bodies (New Brunswick and, Newfoundland and Labrador) have adopted the Canadian Chiropractic Association Code of Conduct.
All chiropractic regulatory bodies of the other provinces and Yukon have adopted their own specific dispositions regarding informed consent.
Chiropractors in Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan and Québec must obtain informed consent in writing.

Abstract
The cortex projects to the striatum topographically.
Thus, different regions of the striatum have been associated with these different functions: the ventral striatum with reward; the caudate nucleus with cognition; and the putamen with motor control.
However, corticostriatal connections are more complex, and interactions between functional territories are extensive.
These interactions occur in specific regions in which convergence of terminal fields from different functional cortical regions are found.
This article provides an overview of the connections of the cortex to the striatum and their role in integrating information across reward, cognitive, and motor functions.
Emphasis is placed on the interface between functional domains within the striatum.


Abstract
Reward prediction errors consist of the differences between received and predicted rewards.
The dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and codes formal economic utility.
Drugs of addiction generate, hijack, and amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on neuronal plasticity.
The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also show reward prediction error coding, but only in subpopulations of neurons.
Thus, the important concept of reward prediction errors is implemented in neuronal hardware.


Abstract
Important frameworks have been developed to understand habits through psychological and neurobiological studies.
Mounting evidence from studies using neural recording methods suggests that habit formation is not a simple process.
We review this evidence and take the position that habits could be sculpted from multiple dissociable changes in neural activity.
These changes occur across multiple brain regions and even within single brain regions.
This strategy of classifying components of a habit based on different brain signals provides a potentially useful new way to conceive of disorders that involve overly fixed behaviors as arising from different potential dysfunctions within the brain's habit network.


Abstract
Choice behavior requires weighing multiple decision variables, such as utility, uncertainty, delay, or effort, that combine to define a subjective value for each considered option or course of action.
This capacity is based on prior learning about potential rewards (and punishments) that result from prior actions.
When made in a social context, decisions can involve strategic thinking about the intentions of others and about the impact of others' behavior on one's own outcome.
Valuation is also influenced by different emotions that serve to adaptively regulate our choices in order to, for example, stay away from excessively risky gambles, prevent future regrets, or avoid personal rejection or conflicts.
Drawing on economic theory and on advances in the study of neuronal mechanisms, we review relevant recent experiments in nonhuman primates and clinical observations made in neurologically impaired patients suffering from impaired decision-making capacities.


Abstract
Decision making has been extensively studied in the context of economics and from a group perspective, but still little is known on individual decision making.
Here we discuss the different cognitive processes involved in decision making and its associated neural substrates.
The putative conductors in decision making appear to be the prefrontal cortex and the striatum.
Impaired decision-making skills in various clinical populations have been associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex and in the striatum.
We highlight the importance of strengthening the degree of integration of both cognitive and neural substrates in order to further our understanding of decision-making skills.
In terms of cognitive paradigms, there is a need to improve the ecological value of experimental tasks that assess decision making in various contexts and with rewards; this would help translate laboratory learnings into real-life benefits.
In terms of neural substrates, the use of neuroimaging techniques helps characterize the neural networks associated with decision making; more recently, ways to modulate brain activity, such as in the prefrontal cortex and connected regions (eg, striatum), with noninvasive brain stimulation have also shed light on the neural and cognitive substrates of decision making.
Together, these cognitive and neural approaches might be useful for patients with impaired decision-making skills.
The drive behind this line of work is that decision-making abilities underlie important aspects of wellness, health, security, and financial and social choices in our daily lives.


Abstract
Intrusive thinking triggers clinical symptoms in many neuropsychiatric disorders.
This microcircuit harbors many potential therapeutic targets.
We focus on preclinical and clinical studies, showing that administering N-acetylcysteine restores uptake of synaptic glutamate by astroglial glutamate transporters and thereby inhibits intrusive thinking.


Abstract
In this review, we discuss causes and consequences of this striata! dopamine alteration.
We discuss why this approach represents a promising tool to understand underlying mechanisms of symptom dimensions by dissecting the contribution of multiple behavioral control systems working in parallel.
We also discuss how it can advance our understanding of the neurobiological implementation of such functions.
Thirdly, we review evidence regarding the topography of dopamine dysfunction within the striatum.
Finally, we present conclusions and outline important aspects to be considered in future studies.


Abstract
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder with a primary etiology of striatal pathology.
The Huntingtin gene (HTT) has a unique feature of a DNA trinucleotide (triplet) repeat, with repeat length ranging from 10 to 35 in the normal population.
The symptoms of HD may be motor, cognitive, and psychiatric, and are consistent with the pathophysiology of frontostriatal circuitry malfunction.
Expressed ubiquitously and throughout the entire life cycle (development through adulthood), mHTT causes initial dysfunction and eventual death of a specific cell population within the striatum.
Although all areas of the brain are eventually affected, the primary pathology of the disease is regionally specific.


Abstract
These techniques are ideally suited to investigating neural circuitry underlying motor and cognitive dysfunction in animal models of human disease.
The precise mechanisms underlying the striatal contribution to both cognitive and motor dysfunction in Parkinson disease are unknown.
Although optogenetic approaches are somewhat removed from clinical use, insight from these studies can help identify novel therapeutic targets and may inspire new treatments for Parkinson disease.
Elucidating how neuronal and behavioral functions are influenced and potentially rescued by optogenetic manipulation in animal models could prove to be translatable to humans.
These insights can be used to guide future brain-stimulation approaches for motor and cognitive abnormalities in Parkinson disease and other neuropsychiatric diseases.


Abstract
The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system is responsible for the negative affective symptomatology of schizophrenia, which may be related to a low dopamine tonus within the ventral striatum.
The monetary incentive delay (MID) task can be used to study the response of the ventral striatum to incentive stimuli.
We show that activation of the ventral striatum is low in patients with schizophrenia, and that this low activation is related to primary and secondary negative symptoms induced by neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotics.
Switching from first-(typical) to second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics increased activation of the ventral striatum due to less blocking of dopamine D2 receptors.
This and similar studies show that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks are suitable to investigate important aspects of antipsychotic mechanisms.

Abstract
Primary immunodeficiencies are a group of heterogeneous disorders resulting from defects affecting the function of ≥1 parts of the immune system.
Current estimates of the prevalence of primary immunodeficiency disease are one in 1200 patients.
In Ontario, where the average general practitioner follows 1300 to 2000 patients, an estimated two patients will have primary immunodeficiency.
Knowledge gaps delay diagnosis and treatment, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.


Abstract
Improved water and child health in Egypt: impact of interrupted water supply and storage of household water on the prevalence of diarrhoea.
Egypt is approaching universal access to improved water supply, but the variable quality of improved water may have a measureable health impact.
We investigated the impact of different measures of improved water access on the prevalence of diarrhoea among children aged under 5 years.
Using data from the 2008 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey and propensity score matching techniques we compared children in households with improved water supplies, with/without interruptions to supplies and with/without in-home storage of water.
Access to improved water that was not subject to cuts resulted in a significant 2.6 percentage point reduction in the prevalence of diarrhoea (4.7% reduction in rural areas), and access to improved water that was not stored prior to use resulted in a 3.5% reduction.
Further research is needed to better understand the nature and causes of piped water interruptions in Egypt, in order to address potential infrastructure challenges that are leading to poorer health outcomes.


Abstract
Relative inequalities in geographic distribution of health care resources in Kermanshah province, Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study aimed to evaluate inequalities in the geographical distribution of human and physical resources in the health sector of Kermanshah province, Islamic Republic of Iran.
In a retrospective, cross-sectional study, data from the Statistical Centre of Iran were used to calculate inequality measures (Gini coefficient and index of dissimilarity) over the years 2005-11.
The highest Gini coefficient for human resources was observed for pharmacists in 2005 (0.75) and the lowest for paramedics in 2010 and 2011 (0.10).
The highest indices of dissimilarity were also for pharmacists in 2005 (29%) and paramedics in 2011 (3%).
For physical resources, the highest and lowest Gini coefficients were for rehabilitation centres in 2010 (0.59) and health houses in 2011 (0.12) respectively.
Generally, inequalities in the distribution of health care resources were lower at the end of the study period, although there was potential for more equitable distribution of pharmacists, specialists, health houses and beds.


Abstract
Prevalence of oro-dental anomalies among schoolchildren in Sana'a city, Yemen.
Practitioners and policy-makers need information about the relative frequency of dental anomalies among children in their region.
This study investigated the prevalence of different oral anomalies among schoolchildren in Sana'a city, Yemen.
A sample of 1000 private and public schoolchildren aged 4-12 years were examined by the same examiner using disposable tongue blades.
The total prevalence of oral anomalies was 15.1%, most commonly in boys (male:female ratio 3.2:1) aged 7-12 years.
The most prevalent dental anomaly related to hard tissues was tooth hypoplasia (2.8%), followed by hypocalcification (2.6%), then microdontia (0.5%), macrodontia (0.4%), hypodontia (0.4%), supernumerary teeth (0.3%), tooth transposition (0.3%), dental fusion (0.2%) and gemination (0.2%).
The most prevalent soft tissues anomaly was fissured tongue (4.0%), followed by ankyloglossia (1.8%), geographic tongue (0.9%), macroglossia (0.4%) and hairy tongue (0.3%).
Appropriate measures need to be taken early to mitigate the negative impact and later costs of treatment of anomalies.


Abstract
Prevalence of and factors associated with smoking among students in Sousse, Tunisia.
Within the framework of the fight against tobacco among young people, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study in 2013 to estimate the prevalence of smoking and to identify associated factors among students in Sousse.
A questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of 556 students in 5 academic institutions in Sousse randomly drawn.
The age of the participants was between 17 and 35 years.
The prevalence of tobacco consumption in the past 12 months was 22.1% and consumption during the past 3 months was 65.3%.
The average age of starting smoking was 17 years.
Smoking prevalence was significantly higher for males (P < 0.001) and those aged over 25 years (P = 0.002).
Students from 2 of the institutions were using more tobacco than their colleagues in the other institutions (P = 0.027).
The high prevalence of smoking found among the students means that prevention measures are essential; this requires increasing self-esteem and evaluating intervention programmes implemented before smoking the first cigarette.


Abstract
Paediatric continuing medical education needs and preferences of UNRWA physicians in Jordan.
Most physicians who work in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) infant and child health programme in Jordan are general practitioners with no postgraduate training in paediatrics.
Furthermore, in resource-poor or remote settings, the ability to deliver live continuing medical education (CME) is often limited.
Of the 89 respondents 80% had attended live medical lectures for CME and 70% CME meetings.
There was a statistically significant relationship between year of graduation from medical school and preference for Internet-based CME.
Implications for CME participation and paediatric CME topics are discussed.


Abstract
Compiling comprehensive national health statistics in a fragmented health information system: lessons learned from Lebanon.
In view of the rapid health transition faced by the country and a highly dominant private sector, the issue of obtaining reliable health statistics is becoming a priority for Lebanon.
This paper reviews the process of compiling and disseminating national health statistics from the multitude of public, private and nongovernmental partners in the country.
The lessons learned from preparing two editions of the National health statistics report in Lebanon allow identification of some challenges and strengths of the current health information system in Lebanon.
The experience emphasizes the need for a close partnership with all stakeholders, an efficient management system, adequate human resources and predefined systems and procedures.
The process would benefit from having an interactive website for exchange of data and information among stakeholders and the public.
The existence of clear guidelines with consistent definitions and standardized forms would also facilitate the collection and analysis of data.


Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), norovirus (NoV), and rotavirus (RV) are all hypothesized to infect humans zoonotically via exposure through swine and pork.
Our study objectives were to estimate Canadian farm-level prevalence of HEV, NoV [specifically porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC)], and RV in finisher pigs, and to study risk factors for farm level viral detection.
Farms were recruited using the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) and FoodNet Canada on-farm sampling platforms.
Samples were assayed using validated real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).


Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be difficult to manage in commercial settings.
A novel type I PRRSV vaccinal strain (94881) was evaluated for safety and efficacy/onset of immunity (OOI) in piglets.
In 2 experiments, groups of piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly (IM) at approximately 14 d of age with a maximum-range commercial dose, an overdose, or a placebo in experiment 1 and either a minimum-range commercial dose or a placebo in experiment 2.
The piglets in experiment 1 were evaluated for local and systemic reactions from days -2 through 14 after vaccination.
The average daily weight gain (ADWG) and the results of serologic and viremia testing were evaluated in experiments 1 and 2.
Lung lesion scores and results of testing for PRRSV in lung tissue were evaluated in experiment 2.
In experiment 1 the vaccine was shown to be safe, as there were no relevant differences between the vaccinated piglets and the piglets given a placebo.


Abstract
Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for ChIFN-γ were generated to establish sandwich ELISA based on 2 different mAbs.
From our results, it appears that the sensitivity range of this sandwich ELISA test is adequate to measure the ex vivo release of ChIFN-γ.


Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that does not express the genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2).
It is an important and clinically relevant condition as it has a poor prognosis and is difficult to treat.
Basal-like triple-negative cancer is highly prevalent in both African-Americans and adolescents.
We therefore examined whether such a cancer likewise occurs in specific breeds and age groups in dogs, focusing on basal-like triple-negative cancer in particular.
In this study, 181 samples from dogs with malignant mammary carcinoma from the 5 most common breeds and 2 age groups in Korea were analyzed.
Histological classification and molecular subtyping, including assessment of immunohistochemical findings, were carried out.
Twenty-five of 28 (89.3%) triple-negative carcinomas were identified as basal-like triple-negative carcinomas.
Analysis of associations of classified factors revealed that the shih tzu breed (9/25, 36.0%) and advanced-age (19/25, 76.0%) groups were characterized by higher prevalence of basal-like triple-negative tumors with diverse histological types and of a higher grade.
These results suggest that breed- and age-related differences can be identified in canine mammary carcinoma and, notably, in the shih tzu breed and at older ages.
Further investigation of these distinguishing characteristics of the shih tzu breed is warranted.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of intravenous alfaxalone with and without premedication on intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy dogs.
Thirty-three dogs were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments: acepromazine [0.03 mg/kg body weight (BW)] with butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg BW) intramuscularly (IM), followed by intravenous (IV) alfaxalone (1.5 mg/kg BW); dexmedetomidine (0.002 mg/kg BW) with hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg BW) IM, followed by alfaxalone (1 mg/kg BW) IV; and saline 0.9% (0.02 mL/kg BW) IM, followed by alfaxalone (3 mg/kg BW) IV.
Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, 15 min, and 30 min after premedication, after pre-oxygenation, after administration of alfaxalone, and after intubation.
After induction and after intubation, the IOP was significantly increased in all groups compared to baseline.
While premedication with acepromazine/butorphanol or dexmedetomidine/hydromorphone did not cause a significant increase in IOP, the risk of vomiting and the associated peak in IOP after dexmedetomidine/hydromorphone should be considered when selecting an anesthetic protocol for dogs with poor tolerance for transient increases in IOP.


Abstract
The Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016-2030) recognizes that people have a central role in improving their own health.
Community participation specifically addresses the third of the key objectives: to transform societies so that women, children and adolescents can realize their rights to the highest attainable standards of health and well-being.
In this paper, we examine what this implies in practice.


Abstract
Evaluation of factors associated with failure of tuberculosis treatment under DOTS in northern Islamic Republic of Iran.
Tuberculosis treatment failure remains a major health problem in many parts of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study was conducted to identify the risk factors associated with failure of tuberculosis treatment under the DOTS strategy in two cities of Golestan province.
A retrospective cohort study in 2012-2013 was conducted on 167 smearpositive tuberculosis patients monitored under DOTS.
Demographic, clinical and treatment outcome factors and social determinants of health were recorded for each patient.
Multivariate regression analysis found that the strongest predictors of tuberculosis treatment failure were: being infected with other diseases (OR 9.35; 95% CI: 3.01-29.1), male sex (OR 5.03; 95% CI: 1.58-16.1), Turkoman ethnicity (OR 11.0; 95% CI: 2.00-60.1), family history of tuberculosis (OR 0.21; 95% CI: 0.05-0.96) and household size (OR 1.21; 95% CI: 0.99-1.48).
Recommendations include better follow-up for patients with other diseases and facilitating access to treatment, especially for Turkoman patients.


Abstract
Epidemiology of tuberculosis and evaluation of treatment outcomes in the national tuberculosis control programme, River Nile state, Sudan, 2011-2013.
Tuberculosis is a major health problem in Sudan, a country that carries 11-15% of the tuberculosis burden in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of tuberculosis in River Nile State and to compare treatment outcomes with WHO recommended indicators.
A descriptive study was conducted on data collected from records of 1221 patients registered at tuberculosis management units over the 3 years 2011-2013.
The mean age of cases was 37.7 (SD 21.5) years and 65.9% were males; 76.3% were pulmonary tuberculosis and 36.9% were sputum smear-positive cases.
Average values for all outcome indicators were suboptimal, notably rates of case notification (30.8 per 100 000), case detection (10.3%), treatment success (79.6%), treatment failure (3.0%), default (8.1%) and death (8.0%).
Of the 264 patients tested for HIV, 3.8% were positive.
Outcome indicators for the national tuberculosis control programme are lagging behind the required targets.


Abstract
Descriptive epidemiology of physical activity among Omani adults: the Oman World Health Survey, 2008.
There is an increasing burden of obesity and obesity-related noncommunicable diseases in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including Oman.
This descriptive, epidemiological study assessed physical activity among 2977 Omani adults using a population-based household survey in 2008.
Overall, 54.2% of men and 41.6% of women were physically active; the rate was higher in younger cohorts and varied significantly by region of residence.
Physical activity related to the transportation (walking and cycling) domain was higher than in the leisure or work domains.
Unmarried men aged 30-39 years were twice as likely to be physically active (OR 2.25) and unmarried women aged 40+ years were half as likely to be active (OR 0.58) than their married counterparts.
Young women not working were less active (OR 0.18) than working women.
Higher education was significantly associated with leisure activity for men aged 30+ years and women aged 40+ years.
Further research to understand regional variations and to identify culturally appropriate strategies to promote physical activity is required.


Abstract
This qualitative study in the Islamic Republic of Iran aimed to explore facilitators and barriers to the use of reproductive health services by unmarried women.
A purposive sample of unmarried women aged 25-60 years in Isfahan city were interviewed about their experiences of reproductive health services in public health centres.


Abstract
Men's perceptions of and participation in family planning in Aqaba and Ma'an governorates, Jordan.
Men's participation in family planning has become a cornerstone in women's reproductive health.
The aim of this study was to examine knowledge, attitudes and practice towards family planning of Jordanian men in southern Jordan.


Abstract
Measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an essential complement to medical evaluation.
However, few studies of this type have been conducted in Morocco.
This study aims to develop normative data for the SF-36 and analyse the HRQOL according to gender and age in the population of Tetouan city, Morocco.
The SF-36 was administered to a sample selected by quotas containing 385 subjects aged over 16 years living in Tetouan.
Comparisons of means were done to determine the significance of differences.
The study population perceived mental health to be worse than physical health.
Men presented significantly higher mean scores than women for all domains of the SF-36.
Perceived health, especially physical health, declines with age, and so participants over the age of 55years recorded a poor perception of their health in the majority of domains measured.
The results highlight the vulnerability of the two groups: women and the elderly.


Abstract
Isolation frequency and susceptibility pattern of non-O1 and non-O139 Vibrio cholerae in a tertiary health care laboratory, 1999-2012.
In the past decade the importance of non-O1 and non-O139 strains of Vibrio cholerae has been highlighted globally.
This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of non-O1 and non-O139 V. cholerae in Pakistan.
Data of stool specimens yielding growth of non-O1 and non-O139 V. cholerae isolated at a national referral laboratory from 1999 to 2012 were retrospectively analysed and evaluated for resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and ofloxacin.
A total of 95 800 stool samples submitted over 1999-2012 yielded 3668 strains of V. cholerae, of which 6% were non-O1 and non-O139 V. cholerae.
A high isolation rate was found in the summer season, with a peak in the year 2003.
Antimicrobial susceptibility data revealed increasing resistance to co-trimoxazole and ampicillin, but strains remained highly susceptible to ofloxacin.
Active surveillance of serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility is essential to predict future epidemics and define measures to curtail the disease.


Abstract
Evaluating the English language scientific writing skills of Saudi dental students at entry level.
Better knowledge is needed about the effectiveness of preparatory English language courses for the health professions.
This study evaluated the scientific writing skills of students finishing their preparatory year of a bachelor of dentistry programme in Saudi Arabia.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2014-15 among first-year dental students at the University of Dammam.
Students were asked to write a 150-word English language assignment that was analysed for writing statistics and problems using Microsoft Word and plagiarism detection software.
Of the 89 respondents, female students used a significantly greater number of words than did male students and their assignments had significantly lower Flesch reading ease scores.
Male students had significantly lower odds of using references (OR 0.04) and higher odds of making punctuation and grammar mistakes (OR 2.63 and 3.91 respectively).
One course of scientific writing in the preparatory year may not be enough to develop adequate writing skills among undergraduate dental students.

Abstract
Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also referred to as deep, high-throughput or massively parallel sequencing, is a powerful new tool that can be used for the complex diagnosis and intensive monitoring of infectious disease in veterinary medicine.
NGS technologies are also being increasingly used to study the aetiology, genomics, evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease, as well as host-pathogen interactions and other aspects of infection biology.

New technology is poised to bridge the gap between the research and diagnostic laboratory.


Abstract
There is a critical need in animal agriculture to develop novel antimicrobials and alternative strategies that will help to reduce the use of antibiotics and address the challenges of antimicrobial resistance.
High-throughput gene expression analysis is providing new tools that are enabling the discovery of host-derived antimicrobial peptides.
Both granulysin and NK-lysin are localised in cytolytic granules in natural killer and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
Morphological alterations observed following chicken NK-lysin binding to Eimeria sporozoites and Escherichia coli membranes indicate damage and disruption of cell membranes, suggesting that NK-lysin kills pathogenic protozoans and bacteria by direct interaction.
Although the host-derived antimicrobial peptides described in this paper may not, by themselves, be able to replace the antibiotics currently used in animal production, their use as specific treatments based on their known mechanisms of action is showing promising results.


Abstract
Transgenic animals resistant to infectious diseases.


Abstract
An excess of pathogenicity in the absence of a reservoir would be detrimental to virus survival.
Most endogenous viruses have lost the capacity to replicate via an infectious cycle and now replicate passively.
The insertion of endogenous viruses has contributed to the evolution of animal genomes, for example in the reproductive biology of mammals.
However, spontaneous viral integration still occasionally occurs in a number of virus-host systems.
This constitutes a potential risk to host survival but also provides an opportunity for diversification and evolution.


Abstract
Factors such as globalisation, climate change and agricultural intensification can increase the risk of microbial emergence.
As a result, there is a growing need for flexible laboratory-based surveillance tools to rapidly identify, characterise and monitor global (re-)emerging diseases.
Here, the authors review the potential applications of high-throughput genomic technologies for the surveillance of veterinary pathogens.
They focus on the two types of surveillance that will benefit most from these new tools: hazard-specific surveillance (pathogen identification and typing) and early-warning surveillance (pathogen discovery).


Abstract
Next-generation sequencing provides a way to partially circumvent this limitation, since the methods required for data acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent.
Comparative genomics and other 'omics' provide new opportunities to study the structure and function of various biological systems of wild species that are otherwise out of reach.
Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help to identify dominant pathways of virus-host interaction and to reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations and species.
This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and livestock.


Abstract
The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the discovery of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 suggests that another SARS-like epidemic is occurring.
Unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which rapidly disappeared in less than one year, MERS has persisted for over three years.
More than 1,600 cases of MERS have been reported worldwide, and the disease carries a worryingly high fatality rate of >30%.
A total of 182 MERS-CoV genomes have been sequenced, including 94 from humans and 88 from dromedary camels.
MERS-CoV is a lineage C Betacoronavirus (ßCoV).
MERS-CoV genomes can be roughly divided into two clades: clade A, which contains only a few strains, and clade B, to which most strains belong.
In contrast to ORF1ab and structural proteins, the putative proteins encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b in the MERS-CoV genome do not share homology with any known host or virus protein, other than those of its closely related lineage C ßCoVs.
Human and dromedary viral genomes have intermingled, indicating that multiple camel-to-human transmission events have occurred.
The multiple origins of MERS-CoV suggest that the virus has been resident in dromedaries for many years.
This is consistent with the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as the 1980s.


Abstract
This article describes the contribution of genomics and functional genomics to studies of the evolution, virulence, epidemiology and diagnosis of both these pathogenic mycobacteria.


Abstract
This problem is particularly acute for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) because the long duration of infection and low levels of infectiousness make tracing the sources of infection difficult.
For over 30 years, the process of contact tracing has been aided by the exploitation of molecular markers in the pathogen, but this has largely only been capable of characterising broad associations between large communities of similar types.
However, the recent advent of mass high-throughput 'whole-genome' sequencing (WGS) has revolutionised forensic epidemiology for other diseases, and now it has the potential to do so for bTB.
In this review, the authors consider the historical context of WGS use and look at what prior molecular techniques have already achieved.
They outline the key approaches to interpreting WGS data and consider both the role of advanced analytical techniques that exploit the evolutionary and epidemiological properties of the system and the problems associated with quantifying the role of hidden reservoirs of disease.
Finally, they consider the particular difficulties associated with developing this technology for routine diagnostics and its potential for mass use.


Abstract
HTS also enables the rapid identification of both known and potentially new viruses from field and clinical samples, thus adding new tools to the fields of viral discovery and metagenomics.
In this paper, the authors give a brief overview of the main bioinformatics tools available for viral genomic research, with a particular emphasis on HTS technologies and their main applications.
They summarise the major steps in various HTS analyses, starting with quality control of raw reads and encompassing activities ranging from consensus and de novo genome assembly to variant calling and metagenomics, as well as RNA sequencing.


Abstract
The objective is to recover the epidemic transmission tree, which identifies who infected whom.
This paper reviews the various approaches that have been taken.
The first step is to define a measure of difference between sequences, which must be done while taking into account such factors as recombination and convergent evolution.
Three broad categories of method exist, of increasing complexity: those that assume no withinhost genetic diversity or mutation, those that assume no within-host diversity but allow mutation, and those that allow both.
Many of the procedures described here are available to researchers as free software.


Abstract
The popular view of the inherent conflict between science and the occult has been rendered obsolete by recent advances in the history of science.
Yet, these historiographical revisions have gone unnoticed in the public understanding of science and public education at large.
Particularly, reconstructions of the formation of modern psychology and its links to psychical research can show that the standard view of the latter as motivated by metaphysical bias fails to stand up to scrutiny.


Abstract
The result is an ongoing shift from curing acute illnesses to the management and care of chronic illness and conditions.
This review discusses how the lifespan development model used in some disciplines within the behavioural sciences can be seen as an extension of the biopsychosocial model.
We present key concepts and recommendations, and we discuss how the lifespan development model can contribute to new and evolving perspectives on orthopedic outcomes and to new directions for research.
We also offer practical guidelines on how to implement the model in orthopedic practice.


Abstract
This study has developed a learning kit for the prevention of domestic burns in childhood.
The main objective was to trial an educational package for children (nursery and primary classes), for the prevention of burns, to be implemented through education in schools.
The educational kit comprises posters, information leaflets, comic books, and pre and post education evaluation materials for school children, parents and teachers.
Moreover, even for older children, it was necessary to find an attractive tool to catch their attention and interest, promoting the understanding and memorization of lessons learned.
In conclusion, the educational kit has been positively assessed.


Abstract
Severe burns trigger a wide range of responses in the victim.
Initial vascular changes are followed by hypermetabolic, inflammatory and immunologic changes.
The prolonged hypermetabolic response is associated with an elevated resting rate of energy consumption, tissue wasting and altered substrate kinetics.
There is increased blood glucose though insulin levels are above normal.
The cortisol level is raised and, together with catecholamine, drives the metabolic response.
The immune system is typically weakened.
There is elevation in blood levels of a wide range of cytokines from activated cells.
These agents drive a prolonged inflammatory response which can lead to tissue damage and multiple organ failure.
Dynamic fluid resuscitation regimens have cut down mortality from shock in the early post-burn period.
However, unbalanced activity of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines can leave patients in an immuno-suppressed state that affects outcomes.
So far, many treatments, such as propranolol, a cardio-protector, and anabolic agents, such as oxandrolone and growth hormone, have been tried with mixed results.
This review focuses on research that elucidated burn pathophysiology.
Some clinical areas in which treatment centred on correcting altered physiology were also included.
We have highlighted both the challenges and significant findings.


Abstract
We conducted a prospective, observational study in a 20-bed Burn Intensive Care Unit in Tunisia.
A total of 121 patients admitted to the Burn ICU were included in our study.
Serum PCT was measured over the entire course of stay in patients with predictive signs of sepsis according to the Americain Burn Association Criteria for the presence of infection.
Patients were assigned to two groups depending on the clinical course and outcome: Group A = non septic patients; Group B = septic patients.
A PCT cutoff value of 0,69 ng/ml for sepsis prediction was associated with the optimal combination of sensitivity (89%), specificity (85%), positive predictive value (82%) and negative predictive value (88%).
Serum procalcitonin levels can be used as an early indicator of septic complication in patients with severe burn injuries as well as in monitoring the response to antimicrobial therapy.


Abstract
We present a retrospective analysis of the management of 150 patients with nasal burns treated in our center between July 2005 and July 2011.
Cosmetic refinements range from flap debulking to the importation of new tissue on to the nose.
Our experience with this challenging group of patients has led us to develop a simple treatment algorithm for the management of nasal burns.


Abstract
The aim of this study is to determine the epidemiological characteristics of burn patients developing pneumonia, as well as the predisposing factors and the mortality of these patients.
Pneumonia, in particular, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients.
Patients with inhalation injuries are exposed to a greater risk due to the possible development of infectious complications in the lower respiratory tract.
During their stay in our Burn Care Unit, 22.9% of our burn patients developed pneumonia and 10.9 % of these patients died.
Risk factors for the development of pneumonia in burn patients were found to be inhalation trauma, high ABSI score, the Baux and modified Baux index, and high ASA score (p<0.01).
Age and gender showed no significant correlation to the incidence of pneumonia.


Abstract
The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that blood perfusion could be improved by the topical application of vasoactive substances.


Abstract
The objective of the study was to describe epidemiologic features of suicidal behavior by burns among women in two bordering provinces in Iran.
These two provinces suffered from war and economic instability with high rates of poverty and unemployment.
Data were obtained from patients, family members, and/or significant others through interviews during the course of hospitalization.
The median age of the patients was 23 years old, with a mean (±SD) of 27.9 (±14.3) years old.
More than one third of women were abused (physically and/or verbally) by family members (i.e. spouse, father-in-law).
Social and economic conditions, as well as violence against women, play a major role in the high rate of suicide by burns.
The findings of this study highlight the need for the implementation of a well-organized approach to reduce the rate of suicide by burns among the most vulnerable populations in Iran.


Abstract
Governments in low- and middle-income countries are legitimizing the implementation of universal health coverage (UHC), following a United Nation's resolution on UHC in 2012 and its reinforcement in the sustainable development goals set in 2015.
We provide justification for explicit health priority-setting and guidance to countries on how to set priorities for UHC.

Negotiations between government ministries of health and finance are a key determinant of the level and effectiveness of public expenditure in the health sector.


Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by repetitive patterns of behaviour and impairments in social interactions and communication abilities.
Although ASD is a heterogeneous disorder, it is a highly genetic condition for which genetic testing is routinely performed.


Abstract
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, which affects multiple organ systems including the central nervous system (CNS).
Though not common, childhood onset SLE is a known and established entity.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in childhood onset SLE.
Of these, psychosis and behavioural symptoms are relatively rare, and there is no consensus on the proper treatment of such cases.
We report a case of 13-year-old boy, diagnosed with lupus nephritis, and presented with psychosis and behavioural symptoms.
The highlight of this case is that the psychiatric symptoms were present despite the primary illness being quiescent.
Thus, the patient was treated with Olanzapine and lorazepam, while continuing immunosuppressive therapy as previously.
Also, MRI brain revealed vasculitic changes in the right hemisphere, which might be one of the etiological factors playing role in the development of these neuropsychiatric symptoms.


Abstract
All burn patients requiring antibiotic therapy based on confirmed or highly suspected bacterial infections were eligible.
The following variables were analyzed and compared in both groups: duration of antibiotic treatment, mortality rate, percentage of patients with relapse or superinfection, maximum SOFA score (days 1-28), length of ICU and hospital stay.
A total of 46 Burn ICU patients receiving antibiotic therapy were enrolled in this study.


Abstract
One focus of improvement of burn care in Ukraine was the management of blood loss and blood transfusions in burn patients.


Abstract
The protocol, developed in-house, was validated by comparing the outcomes of patients with severe extensive burns (SEB) treated before and after implementation of these new guidelines at this institution.
Together, these data demonstrate that the new treatment guidelines dramatically improved the treatment outcome and survival of SEB patients.


Abstract
The objectives of the present study are to review the epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of burn patients presenting with post-burn sequelae and treated at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Pristina, Kosovo, from January 2005 until December 2011.
This study included 188 patients with burns sequelae.
The following variables were considered: age, sex, anatomical location, pathological types, and surgical procedure.
There were 82 men (43.6%) and 106 women (56.4%), ranging in age from 0 to 67 years (mean age 33.5 years), most of the patients were children (139 = 73.9%).
Burn contractures were observed in 135 (71.8%) patients, hypertrophic scars in 32 (17%), keloids in 10 (5.3%), alopecia in 6 (3.2%), syndactyly in 12 (6.4%), ectropion in 4 (2.1%) and ear deformity in 1 (0.53%) cases.
To correct the deformities the most common choice was the Z-plasty technique, used in 31.4% of cases, followed by Z-plasty+full thickness skin grafts in 21.8%, full thickness skin grafts in 18.1%, tissue expansion in 8%, Z-plasty+local flaps in 4.8%, flaps (local, fascio-cutaneous, radial forearm) in 6.9% and direct closure in 6.4%.
Timely wound closure and the development of an individual programme for surgical treatment of burns sequelae are crucial for optimal outcomes in patients with burns.


Abstract
The tissue expansion technique is part of the reconstructive surgeon's armamentarium.
It provides donor skin that is an optimal match in terms of skin colour, texture, sensation and hair-bearing characteristics.
Tissue expansion of the scalp is one of the methods used for the management of alopecia.
Thirty expanders in 30 patients with alopecia were included in the study.
Complications and failures were recorded.


Abstract
Deep burns lead to scarring and contractures for which there is little or no published data on treatment costs.
The purpose of this study was to fill this gap by analysing treatment costs for burn sequelae.
The findings showed that 44.6% patients reported post-burn scarring and 31% needed surgical intervention.
The expected risk for readmission was significantly higher (p=0.0002) with scars compared to without.
It has been revealed that treatment of scars causes higher costs than for other burn sequelae because of multiple surgical interventions.
As well as this, more emphasis should be laid on promoting research for the development of novel anti-scarring therapies.


Abstract
Self-inflicted burns (SIB) consistently account for a small proportion of burn injuries.
Within this population, 39 patients (46%) were identified on a national database as having been admitted to an acute National Health Service (NHS) trust somewhere in the UK with sequelae of deliberate self-harm.
There had been a total of 128 additional hospital admissions.
In the majority of cases (85%) another admission preceded the presentation to our service with SIB.
Only four out of the 17 SIB patients (24%) who died of their injuries had previous hospital admissions with DSH.
This lends weight to the need for thorough holistic assessment of any patient admitted to hospital with sequelae of deliberate self-harm in order to try and provide appropriate support and interventions for these vulnerable individuals to prevent recurrent self-harm or suicide.

Abstract
Evidence of the economic cost of health inequalities helps us understand the benefits of reducing these inequalities.
However, the data needed to generate such evidence is difficult to obtain.
A bottom-up approach relies on individual-level data, which allows costs to be calculated by individual-level characteristics not always found in other data sources.
This includes indicators of SES such as level of education or income.
In this study, the population was divided into quintiles based on income, and the health care costs incurred by these five income groups were examined for a single year (2007-2008).


Abstract
Risk factors for neonatal intensive care unit admission in Amman, Jordan.
A better understanding of risk factors for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission can inform interventions to improve neonatal survival.
This study aimed to describe a population of newborns admitted to a NICU in Amman, Jordan, and compare them with newborns discharged to home.
Newborns born within 96 hours at Al-Bashir Hospital were enrolled from February 2010 to June 2011.
Demographic and clinical data were collected for mothers and newborns.
Of 5466 enrolled neonates, 373 (6.8%) were admitted to the NICU.
The median gestational age of NICU infants was 36 weeks, median birth weight was 2.2 kg and 49.5% were delivered by non-elective caesarean section.
Lower gestational age, lower birth weight, delivery by caesarean section and birth in the month of May were statistically significant risk factors for NICU admission.
Risk factors for NICU admission were consistent with other populations worldwide; however, median gestational age and birth weight were higher than in developed countries.


Abstract
Trend of bacterial meningitis in Bahrain from 1990 to 2013 and effect of introduction of new vaccines.
Meningitis is among the 10 commonest infectious causes of death worldwide.
This retrospective analysis of reported cases of meningitis in Bahrain aimed to assess the trend in the incidence of bacterial meningitis from 1990 to 2013, before and after the introduction of new vaccines.
Of 1455 reported cases of meningitis during the study period 73.1% were viral and 26.9% were bacterial etiology (tuberculous meningitis 8.3%; Streptococcus pneumoniae 4.9%, Haemophilus influenzae 3.6% and Neisseria meningitidis 1.7%).
There was a peak of meningitis cases in 1995-1996.
The incidence of meningitis due to H. influenzae and N. meningitidis showed a marked reduction after the introduction of the corresponding vaccines in 1998 and 2001 respectively, and S. pneumoniae became the predominant organism after Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The changing trend in the etiology of bacterial meningitis points to the need to study vaccination programme modifications, such as pneumococcal vaccine for the adult population, especially high-risk groups.


Abstract
Change in attitudes and knowledge of problem drug use and harm reduction among a community cohort in Kabul, Afghanistan.
This pre-post evaluation aimed to measure changes in knowledge and attitudes towards drug users among community representatives in Kabul, Afghanistan, over a period of expansion of harm reduction and drug dependence programming.
A convenience sample of 160 professionals aged 18+ years completed interview questionnaires in 2007 and 2009.
Views endorsing programme quality and the provision of condoms, infection counselling/testing and needle/syringe distribution increased significantly over the 2-year period.
In 13 of 38 statements, there was a substantial (> 10%) change in agreement level, most commonly among men and medical professionals.
Further community education through the media and a more cohesive government drug policy may be needed to strengthen community support for harm reduction/drug treatment in Afghanistan.


Abstract
Accuracy of the VITEK® 2 system for a rapid and direct identification and susceptibility testing of Gramnegative rods and Gram-positive cocci in blood samples.
The performance of the VITEK® 2 system for direct rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacteria responsible for blood infections was determined.
The isolates studied included 166 Gram-negative rods and 74 Gram-positive cocci from inpatients.
Specially treated monomicrobial samples from positive blood culture bottles were directly inoculated into the VITEK 2 system and the results were compared with those from cards inoculated with standardized bacterial suspensions.
Compared with the standard method, 95.8% of Gram-negative rods were correctly identified by VITEK 2 and the overall level of agreement between the two methods in susceptibility testing was 92.0%.
For Gram-positive bacteria, 89.2% were correctly identified by VITEK 2 and susceptibility testing revealed an overall agreement rate of 91.3%.


Abstract
Routine immunization services in Pakistan: seeing beyond the numbers.
Vaccine-preventable diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years of age in Pakistan, and the country remains one of the last reservoirs of polio, posing a threat of viral spread within the region and globally.
This structured review describes challenges in the achievement of vaccination targets and identifies arenas for policy and programmatic interventions and future research.
The EPI requires multi-pronged, multi-level, coordinated interventions to improve programme functioning and to enhance vaccination uptake at community level.
Additionally, a lack of rigorous scientific enquiry on vaccination services limits the introduction of well-developed, responsive interventions.
The paper describes systemic bottlenecks, proposes potential solutions and suggests lines of further enquiry to understand and reduce the languishing immunization rates in Pakistan.


Abstract
Responding to physical and psychological health impacts of disasters: case study of the Iranian disaster rehabilitation plan.
This paper describes the process of developing a national pre-disaster plan for physical health and psychological rehabilitation of disaster-stricken communities.
The Ministry of Health and the Welfare Organization were selected as the two responsible organizations.
Integrated management at all levels, and sharing information, education and funding, were identified as ways to improve stakeholders' participation and collaboration.
A system is needed for evaluating the implementation of the disaster rehabilitation plan, using valid and reliable indicators.


Abstract
To meet the country's health goals for 2011-2016, a qualitative review of exposure to risk factors for cancer in Qatar was conducted in 2013.
The review included exposure to environmental agents carcinogenic to humans (International Agency for Research on Cancer classification), as well as lifestyle factors known to affect cancer risk.
Information from all available sources was assembled and reviewed.
The levels of particulate matter reported in Qatar were in the upper range of ambient air pollutants reported internationally, and may influence the country's future lung cancer burden.
The limited data on occupational exposure suggests that the greatest risks for workers in the construction industry are likely to be from environmental dust and related air pollutants.
Extended monitoring of the composition of and human exposure to air pollutants is recommended.


Abstract
Obesity is an increasing public health problem, with two-thirds of the adult population in many Western countries now being either overweight or obese.
Male obesity is associated with late onset hypogonadism, a condition characterised by decreased serum testosterone, sperm quality plus diminished fertility and quality of life.
Obesity and a high fat/high calorie diet are both reported to result in changes to gut bacteria and intestinal wall permeability, leading to the passage of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide- LPS) from within the gut lumen into the circulation (metabolic endotoxaemia), where it initiates systemic inflammation.
Endotoxin is known to reduce testosterone production by the testis, both by direct inhibition of Leydig cell steroidogenic pathways and indirectly by reducing pituitary LH drive, thereby also leading to a decline in sperm production.
In this paper we also highlight the novel evolutionary benefits of the GELDING theory.
Testosterone is known to be a powerful immune-suppressive, decreasing a man's ability to fight infection.
Therefore we postulate that the male reproductive axis has evolved the capacity to lower testosterone production during times of infection and resulting endotoxin exposure, decreasing the immunosuppressive influence of testosterone, in turn enhancing the ability to fight infection.
While this response is adaptive in times of sepsis, it becomes maladaptive in the setting of "non-infectious" obesity related metabolic endotoxaemia.


Abstract
Poverty, food insecurity and poor nutrition in the population are important contributors to the burden of tuberculosis (TB).
Food and nutritional support as an incentive and enabler is employed by national TB control programmes (NTPs) worldwide as a means to encourage treatment initiation and adherence and to improve the nutritional status of patients with TB.
It also offers a safety net for food-insecure households affected by TB to mitigate the financial consequences of the disease.
This paper reports on the primary lessons from the review of the World Food Programme's (WFP's) Food Assistance Programme for TB patients in Afghanistan.
It aims to inform the design, implementation and scale-up of TB programmes in settings where food insecurity and malnutrition are prevalent.
It also documents qualitative findings that suggest that patients, their families and providers viewed food support as an important asset and an essential element of the national TB control strategy.
While the impact on treatment success or case detection could not be quantified, it is likely that the WFP intervention had a positive impact on the patients and their households, therefore contributing to the success of the DOTS-based NTP.


Abstract
To find 'missing' tuberculosis (TB) cases, in November 2014 we trained private practitioners (PPs) and Ayurvedic practitioners (APs; Indian system of medicine) in Bilaspur district, India, to identify patients with presumptive TB and refer them to sputum microscopy centres.
To reinforce this training, we sent weekly text message reminders during January-March 2015.
All 50 APs and 23 of 29 PPs participated.
The number of patients with presumptive TB referred by the PPs and APs increased from 38 (January-March 2014) to 104 (January-March 2015), and the number of smear-positive TB patients diagnosed increased from 5 to 16, a 220% increase.


Abstract
It appears that a great many chiropractors and chiropractic institutions are involved in health care initiatives in developing countries.
Several challenges to effective care are also identified.

The attending chiropractor assessed the athlete, and deemed manipulation was appropriate.


Abstract
The sacrum, by virtue of its anatomic location plays a key role in providing stability and strength to the pelvis.
Presence of intervertebral discs in sacrum and coccyx is rare.
Knowledge of its variations is of utmost importance to surgeons and radiologists.
The current study focused on the presence of intervertebral discs between the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae in south Indian cadaveric pelvises.
We observed 56 adult pelvises of which, 34 (61%) pelvises showed the presence of intervertebral discs between the sacral vertebrae and between the coccygeal vertebrae, while 22 (39%) pelvises did not have the intervertebral discs either in the sacrum or the coccyx.
We also found that most of the specimens had discs between S1 and S2 vertebrae (39%), followed by, between S4 and S5 (18%), between S2-S3 (14%) and least being between S3-S4 (13%).
In the coccyx it was found that 7% of pelvises had disc between Co1-Co2, 4% of them had between Co2-Co3 and 4% had between Co3-Co4.
Knowledge regarding such anatomic variations in the sacro-coccygeal region is important to note because they require alterations in various instrumentation procedures involving the sacrum.


Abstract
In early 2015, the paediatric formulation of injectable digoxin (50 μg/mL) was discontinued in Canada.
The only remaining injectable formulation is five times more concentrated.
This recent event has major implications for paediatric hospitals all over the country.
The use of a more concentrated formulation is of particular concern in low-weight infants because the required volumes of digoxin are almost impossible to draw precisely.
Such a situation is problematic because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin.
The authors believe it remains imperative that patients requiring intravenous digoxin be treated with the safest and most efficient formulation possible, regardless of their age or size.

Biliary atresia is the most common cause of end-stage liver disease and liver cirrhosis in children, and the leading indication for liver transplantation in the paediatric population.
There is no cure for biliary atresia; however, timely diagnosis and early infant age at surgical intervention using the Kasai portoenterostomy optimize the prognosis.
Late referral is a significant problem in Canada and elsewhere.

Periconceptional folic acid significantly reduces the risk of neural tube defects.


Abstract
Preterm infants younger than 37 weeks corrected gestational age are at increased risk for abnormal control of respiration.
The infant car seat challenge has been used as a screening tool to ensure cardiorespiratory stability before discharging preterm infants from many hospitals in Canada.
This finding has prompted a change in recommendation from a previous Canadian Paediatric Society position statement published in 2000.


Abstract
Rotavirus B (RVB) infection in cattle is poorly understood.
The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiological features of repeated outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea due to RVB infection in adult cattle on a large dairy farm complex in Japan.
In October 2002, approximately 550 adult cows and approximately 450 in February 2005 had acute watery diarrhea at several farms on the complex.
Four months before the first outbreak, RVB antibody-positive rates at subsequently affected farms were significantly lower than at non-affected farms (30% to 32% versus 61% to 67%).
During the acute phase of both outbreaks, RVB antibody-positive rates in diarrheal cows tested were as low as 15% to 26%.
Most of the farms affected in the second outbreak were also involved in the first outbreak.
Some adult cows with RVB diarrhea in the first outbreak showed not only RVB seroresponse, but also RVB shedding in the second outbreak, although none of these cows developed diarrhea.
Nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 genes revealed a close relationship between RVB strains in both outbreaks.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on repeated RVB infections in the same cattle.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to develop a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay (TR-IFMA) for quantification of salivary alpha-amylase in sheep.
For that purpose, after the design of the assay, an analytical and a clinical validation were carried out.
The analytical validation of the assay showed intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of 6.1% and 10.57%, respectively and an analytical limit of detection of 0.09 ng/mL.
The assay also demonstrated a high level of accuracy, as determined by linearity under dilution.
In that model, 11 sheep were immobilized and confronted with a sheepdog to induce stress.
Saliva samples were obtained before stress induction and 15, 30, and 60 min afterwards.
Salivary cortisol was measured as a reference of stress level.


Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) plays an important role in the immune system.


Abstract
Canine hemangiosarcoma (HSA) is a progressive malignant neoplasm with no current effective treatment.
Previous studies showed that receptor tyrosine kinases and molecules within their downstream pathways involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were overexpressed in canine, human, and murine tumors, including HSA.
The present study investigated the effects of inhibitors of these pathways in canine splenic and hepatic HSA cell lines using assays of cell viability and apoptosis.
Inhibitors of the MAPK pathway did not affect canine HSA cell viability.
However, cell viability was significantly reduced by exposure to inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and the PI3K/Akt/m-TOR pathway; these inhibitors also induced apoptosis in these cell lines.
These results suggest that these inhibitors reduce the proliferation of canine HSA cells by inducing apoptosis.
Further study of these inhibitors, using xenograft mouse models of canine HSA, are warranted to explore their potential for clinical application.


Abstract
Local (skeletal muscle and adipose) and systemic inflammation are implicated in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance in humans.
In horses, obesity is neither strongly nor consistently associated with systemic inflammation.
The role of skeletal muscle inflammation in the development of insulin dysregulation (insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia) remains to be determined.
We hypothesized that skeletal muscle inflammation is related to obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia in horses.
Thirty-five light-breed horses with body condition scores (BCSs) of 3/9 to 9/9 were studied, including 7 obese, normoinsulinemic (BCS ≥ 7, resting serum insulin < 30 μIU/mL) and 6 obese, hyperinsulinemic (resting serum insulin ≥ 30 μIU/mL) horses.
Inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies and plasma.
Relationships between markers of inflammation and BCS were evaluated.
To assess the role of inflammation in obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia, markers of inflammation were compared among lean or ideal, normoinsulinemic (L-NI); obese, normoinsulinemic (O-NI); and obese, hyperinsulinemic (O-HI) horses.
Skeletal muscle and plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) concentrations were negatively correlated with BCS.
When comparing inflammatory markers among groups, skeletal muscle TNFα was lower in the O-HI group than in the O-NI or L-NI groups.
In horses, neither skeletal muscle nor systemic inflammation appears to be positively related to obesity or obesity-associated hyperinsulinemia.


Abstract
A new technique for repeated biopsies of the mammary gland in dairy cows allotted to Latin-square design studies.
A total of 16 Holstein cows were subjected to 4 mammary biopsies each at 3-week intervals for a total of 64 biopsies.
A 0.75-cm incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the mammary gland and a trocar and cannula were inserted using a circular motion.
The trocar was withdrawn and a syringe was plugged into the base of the cannula to create a vacuum for sampling mammary tissue.
Two attempts were usually enough to obtain 800 mg of tissue.
Visual examination of milk samples 10 d after the biopsy indicated no trace of blood, except in samples from 2 cows.
All wounds healed without infection and subcutaneous hematomas resorbed within 7 d.
There was no incidence of mastitis throughout the lactation.
This technique provides a new tool for biopsy of the mammary gland repeated at short intervals with the main effect being a decrease in milk production.
Although secondary complications leading to illness or death are always a risk with any procedure, this biopsy technique was carried out without complications to the health of animals and with no incidence of mastitis during the lactation.


Abstract
A pneumatic tourniquet set at 450 mmHg was left in place for 30 min.
Synovial fluid was collected from the metacarpophalangeal joint 35 min and 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after infusion of the antimicrobials.
Concentrations of amikacin and penicillin in synovial fluid were quantitated by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry analysis.


Abstract
Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory process that frequently involves peripancreatic tissues and remote organ systems.
It has high morbidity and mortality rates in both human and veterinary patients.
The severity of pancreatitis is generally determined by events that occur after acinar cell injury in the pancreas, resulting in elevated levels of various proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL) 1β and 6, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α).
When these mediators are excessively released into the systemic circulation, severe pancreatitis occurs with systemic complications.
This pathophysiological process is similar to that of sepsis; thus, there are many striking clinical similarities between patients with septic shock and those with severe acute pancreatitis.
We induced acute pancreatitis using caerulein in dogs and measured the change in the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA peaked at 3 h, at twice the baseline levels, and the serum concentrations of amylase and lipase also increased.
Histopathological examination revealed severe hyperemia of the pancreas and hyperemia in the duodenal villi and the hepatic sinusoid.
Thus, pancreatitis can be considered an appropriate model to better understand the development of naturally occurring sepsis and to assist in the effective treatment and management of septic patients.


Abstract
A robust health infrastructure in every country is the most effective long-term preparedness strategy for global health emergencies.
This includes not only health systems and their human resources, but also countries' legal infrastructure for health: the laws and policies that empower, obligate and sometimes limit government and private action.
The law is also an important tool in health promotion and protection.
Public health professionals play important roles in health law - from the development of policies, through their enforcement, to the scientific evaluation of the health impact of laws.
Member States are already mandated to communicate their national health laws and regulations to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The mission of the unit or centre would be to define and integrate scientific and legal expertise in public health law, both technical and programmatic, across the work of WHO, and to conduct and facilitate global health policy surveillance.


Abstract
The importance of rewarming has not been extensively studied in current guidelines, whereas the importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is well established.
Active core rewarming with warm saline lavages, intravenous fluids and warm air may be used at a rate of 1.8°C/h to 5.3°C/h according to most guidelines.
Rewarming guidelines for asphyxiated infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermic may not be applicable to infants with accidental exposure, as in the present case.
The present case of a near-term severely hypothermic infant reinforces the current recommendation of continuing resuscitative measures, irrespective of response to resuscitation, until the infant has been rewarmed.


Abstract
In the Netherlands, where the Groningen Protocol is in place, euthanasia in now legal for infants and children.
The present article considers whether PHD should be applied to young children in Canada and how these paediatric cases differ from adult cases.
The role of worldviews in the deliberation of any moral question and the importance of recognizing personal bias are highlighted.
The authors present common issues regarding PHD, including suffering, parental autonomy and future quality of life, and examine the basic assumptions on which these arguments are made.
Finally, they conclude that the assumptions required are incorrect and that PHD should not be allowed in the case of children.
Instead, policies should continue to strive for the protection and promotion of health in all children.


Abstract
The Canadian Pediatric Surgery Network (CAPSNet) has been collecting population-based data regarding congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) across its 17 perinatal sites since 2005.
With >500 infants registered to date, CAPSNet has addressed many critical knowledge gaps pertaining to CDH care.
Most importantly, it has identified variability in both CDH practice and outcome across Canada.
Using the successful Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) method, CAPSNet is undertaking a national, multidisciplinary effort to standardize best practices for CDH, from prenatal diagnosis to hospital discharge, based on the best available evidence.
The present article outlines the value of clinical research networks and the process CAPSNet will undertake to produce national consensus guidelines for CDH care.


Abstract
The odds of diagnosing acute otitis media (AOM) was examined according to perceived redness or bulging of the TM.
The authors suggest that training curricula emphasize the strong association between a bulging TM and a diagnosis of AOM, while de-emphasizing the association between TM redness and AOM.


Abstract
In recent years, youth have been exposed to a broader spectrum of tobacco products including smokeless tobacco, hookah (water pipe) and e-cigarettes.
Despite active local, provincial/territorial and national prevention strategies and legislated controls, thousands of teenagers develop an addiction to tobacco products each year.
Interventions for which limited or conflicting data exist are also discussed.


Abstract
Canada has witnessed a general decrease in smoking prevalence among all age groups in recent years.
However, despite large numbers of campaigns and interventions, thousands of young Canadians continue to initiate cigarette smoking every year.
The increasing popularity of alternative tobacco products and e-cigarettes is also creating new health challenges.
Research has shown that the deleterious effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke are significant and long lasting.
Clinicians need to integrate tobacco counselling into health assessments of teenagers and be aware of the roles that families, communities and governments can play in promoting tobacco-free environments.
Information, effective strategies and opportunities for health care professionals to intervene and advocate for Canadian adolescents are discussed.


Abstract

The purpose of the present review was to scope the existing literature and policy, and to synthesize findings into an integrated and accessible report.
Future research priorities and policy implications are then identified.


Abstract
The operation, products and promotion of waterpipe businesses in New York City, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
We evaluated the customers, operations, products and advertising of these businesses to explore the unique policy challenges created by the suppliers of waterpipes.
We completed a cross-sectional survey consisting of structured site observations and in-person interviews of businesses in New York City, Abu Dhabi and Dubai identified using Google, Yelp, Timeout Dubai and Timeout Abu Dhabi and neighbourhood visits in 2014.
Regular customers made up 59% of customers.
Franchises or chains were 28% of businesses.
Waterpipes made up 39% of sales with 87% of businesses offering food within their menu.
Flavoured tobacco made up 94% of sales.
Discounts were offered by 47% of businesses and 94% of businesses used advertising, often through social media.
The market consists of largely independent businesses, with a large regular customer base, frequently offering diversified services beyond waterpipes.
These businesses advertise using both traditional and social media.
The economics of waterpipe businesses is very different from the economics of cigarettes, and unique regulatory strategies are needed to control this epidemic.


Abstract
Risk of hypertension in Yozgat Province, Central Anatolia: application of Framingham Hypertension Prediction Risk Score.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the risk of hypertension in 1106 Caucasian individuals aged 20-69 years in Yozgat Province, using the Framingham Hypertension Risk Prediction Score (FHRPS).
According to FHRPS, average risk of developing hypertension over 4 years was 6.2%.
The participants were classified into low- (<5%), moderate- (5% to 10%) and high- (>10%) risk groups.
The percentage of participants that fell into these groups was 59.4%, 19.8% and 20.8% respectively.
The proportion of participants in the high-risk group was similar to the 4-year incidence of hypertension (21.3%) in the Turkish population.
Regression analysis showed that high salt consumption and low educational level significantly increased the risk of hypertension.
Economic level, fat consumption, life satisfaction, physical activity, and fruit and vegetable consumption were not correlated with risk of hypertension.
This study shows that FHRPS can also be used for predicting risk of hypertension in Central Anatolia.


Abstract
Comprehensive objective structured clinical examination in Qatar: assessment of cultural and contextual barriers.
Eight cases were developed, validated, and had standards set according to a blueprint, and were assessed with graduating pharmacy students.
Assessor reliability was evaluated using inter-class coefficients (ICCs).
Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparing OSCE results to professional skills course grades.
Field notes were maintained to generate recommendations for implementation in other contexts.
The examination pass mark was 424 points out of 700 (60.6%).
All 23 participants passed.
Mean performance was 74.6%.
Low to moderate inter-rater reliability was obtained for analytical and global components (average ICC 0.77 and 0.48, respectively).
In conclusion, OSCE was feasible in Qatar but context-related validity and reliability concerns must be addressed prior to future iterations in Qatar and elsewhere.


Abstract
Assessment of the social accountability of the faculty of medicine at University of Gezira, Sudan.
A socially accountable medical school is one that directs its education, research and service activities towards addressing the priority health concerns of the community it serves and verifying its impact on the community.
This study aimed to assess the social accountability of the University of Gezira faculty of medicine in Sudan.
We reviewed the literature, faculty documents and reports and used both the World Health Organization social accountability grid and the conceptualization-production-usability model as frameworks for analysis.
In most of the domains and phases of the social accountability grid, the faculty's educational programme was found to be well-planned and well-implemented, demonstrating an impact on the community and active participation in health-system development in the local area.


Abstract
Hepatitis B and C in the Syrian Arab Republic: a review.
This paper reviews the epidemiology and determinants of hepatitis B and C in the Syrian Arab Republic as well as their treatment and prevention.
A systematic search of Medline, PubMed and Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region was carried out in addition to a review of grey literature and relevant datasets in the Syrian Arab Republic.
Low to low-intermediate levels of endemicity of both infections were noted at the national level.
However, striking geographic differences and high prevalence among high-risk groups were noticeable.


Abstract
Control of malaria outbreak due to Plasmodium vivax in Aswan Governorate, Egypt.
In 2014, after several years of maintaining zero malaria indigenous cases, Egypt had an outbreak of Plasmodium vivax: 21 confirmed cases during May-June 2014.
In response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) launched an emergency response through early detection and prompt treatment of cases, vector control, public education and intersectoral collaboration.
Twenty cases (95.2%) were residents of El-Sheikh Mostafa village, Edfu district, Aswan governorate, southern Egypt.
All cases, consequent to the index case were identified through house-to-house surveillance visits.
One P. falciparum-infected case was also identified in the same village.
Treatment of all infected cases was initiated following laboratory confirmation.
The MoHP's rapid response to and containment of the outbreak demonstrates the institutional capacity for detection and control of outbreaks which can occur after elimination.


Abstract
Assessment of core and support functions of casebased surveillance of meningitis in hospitals in Khartoum State in 2015.
Case-based surveillance of meningitis was implemented in Khartoum State in February 2013 but its implementation has not been evaluated.
This study assessed some core (case confirmation) and support (case reporting and investigation resources) functions of case-based surveillance of meningitis at hospital level in Khartoum State, Sudan, from January to March 2015.
An interview questionnaire and checklist were used to collect data from 31 hospitals.
A poster containing the case definition of meningitis was fixed to the wall in 18% of the hospitals.
Bacteriological culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and antibiotic sensitivity testing of the cultured bacteria were available in one-third of the hospitals.
Laboratory personnel trained in CSF examination were present in 29% of the hospitals, while trained reporting unit personnel were present in 52%.
A telephone for reporting was present in 74% of the hospitals.
The system for casebased surveillance of meningitis needs to be strengthened, particularly the functions related to case confirmation.


Abstract
What explains the widening disparities in child health and social circumstance in Canada?
And why do we tolerate such inequality?
The author explores the controversial tax policy of income-splitting to contextualize this discussion of values, and argues that our polity increasingly privileges economic liberty above equality or solidarity.


Abstract
Unfortunately, the federal government adopted a definition of Jordan's Principle that was so narrow (complex medical needs with multiple service providers) that no child ever qualified.
This narrow definition has been found to be unlawful by the Federal Court of Canada and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.
The present commentary describes Jordan's Principle, the legal cases that have considered it and the implications of those decisions for health care providers.


Abstract
While poverty is a recognized risk factor for ill health, directly intervening on the effects of poverty has traditionally been considered to fall outside the realm of a physician's daily practice.
Yet, to appropriately respond to the health needs of all children, we have the social responsibility to help our trainees become competent health advocates.
Experiential learning approaches can be used to aid students in developing identities and competencies as health advocates.


Abstract
Included with the checklist tables are five pages of selected guidelines and resources.


Abstract
Adolescent parents and their children present to health care practitioners as two paediatric patients, each with unique health care needs.


Abstract
A 30-year-old Caucasian man presented to the pulmonary function laboratory for a methacholine challenge test.
However, the patient complained of chest tightness and dyspnea, similar to the symptoms he experienced after running.
Because the reduction in specific airway conductance was accompanied by familiar symptoms, the post-test probability of asthma increases, even in the absence of a 20% reduction in FEV1.


Abstract
Serious mental illness (SMI) results in functional disability that imposes a significant burden on individuals, caregivers, and society.
Development of novel treatments is under way in an effort to improve the illness domains of cognitive impairment and negative symptoms and subsequently to improve functional outcomes.
Functional assessments relying on self- and informant report present a number of limitations.
Identifying alternative strategies to assess functioning that are reliable, valid, and sensitive to change is necessary for use in clinical trials.
Measures of functional capacity have been proposed for clinical trials investigating compounds to treat cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
Alternative approaches employing effort-based decision making or daily activity recording using instruments such as the Daily Activity Report may be more appropriate for studies focused on improving negative symptoms.


Abstract
First, a comprehensive profile of a patient's functioning requires multiple assessment methods.
Second, assessment content and measurement constructs must change with the times.
Third, technology can enhance and extend functional assessment.
Fourth, performance-based assessments of everyday activities can also be used to measure body functions/impairments.
Finally, the differential complexity of everyday activities that a patient can master or successfully complete can also provide a ruler with which to measure progress.


Abstract
Disorders of consciousness (DOCs) cause great human suffering and material costs for society.
Understanding of these disorders has advanced remarkably in recent years, but uncertainty remains with respect to the diagnostic criteria and standards of care.
One of the most serious problems concerns misdiagnoses, their impact on medical decision-making, and on patients' well-being.
Recent studies use neurotechnology to assess residual consciousness in DOC patients that traditional behavioral diagnostic criteria are unable to detect.
The results show an urgent need to strengthen the development of new diagnostic tools and more refined diagnostic criteria.
If residual consciousness may be inferred from robust and reproducible results from neurotechnological communication with DOC patients, this also raises ethical challenges.
With reference to the moral notions of beneficence and fundamental rights, five ethical imperatives are here suggested in terms of diagnosis, communication, interpretation of subjective states, adaptation of living conditions, and care.


Abstract
Assessment and outcome monitoring are critical for the effective detection and treatment of mental illness.
Mobile technology (mobile applications on smartphones, activity bracelets) has the potential to overcome such problems with traditional assessment and provide information about patient symptoms, behavior, and functioning in real time.
Although the use of sensors and apps are widespread, several questions remain in the field regarding the reliability of off-the-shelf apps and sensors, use of these tools by consumers, and provider use of these data in clinical decision-making.


Abstract
The functional impairment associated with serious mental illness (SMI) places an immense burden on individuals and society, and disability often persists even after efficacious treatment of psychopathologic symptoms.
Traditional methods of measuring functioning have limitations, and numerous obstacles reduce the reach and impact of evidence-based interventions developed to improve functioning in SMI.
This review describes the potential of technological innovations for overcoming the challenges involved in both functional assessment and intervention in people with SMI.


Abstract
More than 800 000 people die every year from suicide, and about 20 times more attempt suicide.
In most countries, suicide risk is highest in older males, and risk of attempted suicide is highest in younger females.
In the vast majority of cases, suicidal behavior occurs in the context of psychiatric disorders, depression being the most important one.
Improving the treatment of depression, restricting access to lethal means, and avoiding the Werther effect (imitation suicide) are central aspects of suicide prevention programs.
In several European regions, the four-level intervention concept of the European Alliance Against Depression (www.EAAD.net), simultaneously targeting depression and suicidal behavior, has been found to have preventive effects on suicidal behavior.
It has already been implemented in more than 100 regions in Europe.


Abstract
This paper reviews selected behavioral tailoring strategies that aim to improve medication adherence and other functional outcomes among individuals with serious mental illness.


Abstract
A wide range of Internet interventions, mostly grounded in methods of cognitive behavioral therapy, have been developed and tested for several mental disorders.
The evidence to date shows that these interventions are effective in reducing symptoms of depression.
Only a minority of people suffering from depression receive adequate treatment, and Internet interventions might help bridge the large treatment gap.
This review summarizes the current body of evidence and highlights pros and cons of Internet interventions.
It also outlines how they could be implemented in mental health care systems and points out unresolved questions, as well as future directions, in this research field.


Abstract
Mobile technologies are revolutionizing the field of mental health, and particular progress has been made in their application to addiction research and treatment.
The present article presents a conceptual review of these advances while using illustrations of research applications that are capable of overcoming specific methodological barriers.
Finally, a brief review of both the benefits and risks of mobile technology use for the treatment of patients will be addressed.


Abstract
Physiotherapists use red flags to screen for serious pathology.
Paediatric osteosarcoma is a rare disease, occurring predominantly in the area of the knee and shoulder, and it is not always included by physiotherapists on a differential diagnosis list.
Traditional red flags do not always correspond to the initial signs and symptoms of osteosarcoma.


Abstract
Calf diarrhea was treated with antimicrobial drugs by 57.7% of the farmers.
Fluorochinolones were used in 47% of all parenteral treatments and oral antimicrobial drugs included macrolides in 11% of the cases.
Improvements in colostrum management and treatment strategies are urgently needed.


Abstract
The antibiotic susceptibility of the organisms was determined by measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentrations.
Of the 56 E. coli isolates, 55.3% exhibited resistance to tetracyclines, 55.3% to sulfonamides, 39.3% to beta-lactams, 30.3% to aminoglycosides, 8.9% to fluorochinolones and 3.5% to 3rd generation cephalosporins.
Of the 37 P. multocida isolates, 48.6% exhibited resistance to tetracyclines, 16.2% to beta-lactams, and 5.4% each to macrolides, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides.
The 8 M. haemolytica isolates showed no resistances against the tested antibiotics.


Abstract
Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae is the causative agent of swine dysentery (SD), a severe mucohaemorrhagic diarrheal disease in pigs worldwide.
So far, the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of B. hyodysenteriae in Switzerland have not been investigated.
Tiamulin and valnemulin showed high antimicrobial activity inhibiting all isolates at low concentrations.
The susceptibility testing of doxycycline revealed values from ≤0.25 μg/ ml (47%) to 2 μg/ml (10%).
The MIC values of lincomycin ranged between ≤0.5 μg/ml (30%) and 32 μg/ml (43%).
For tylosin, 57% of the isolates could not be inhibited at the highest concentration of ≥128 μg/ml.
The MIC values for tylvalosin were between ≤0.25 μg/ml (10%) and 8 μg/ml (20%).
These findings reveal Switzerland's favourable situation compared to other European countries.


Abstract

Abstract
From entry to slaughter the daily doses of antibiotics on group level averaged 35.6 in young calves, 26.2 in commercial calves, and 21.0 in old calves.
Of the old calves 16.9% were individually treated.
Intensive veterinary care guaranteed early recognition of disease and euthanasia of terminally morbid calves.
The different entry ages did not lead to any reduction in mortality or in antimicrobial use compared to previous studies.


Abstract
The honeys with a high level of antibacterial activity were analyzed for the presence of tetracyclines, sulfonamides and macrolide residues.
The agar well diffusion method showed the greatest antimicrobial activity for honeydew, chestnut and lime tree honeys.
The MICs and MBCs identified the close similarity to the medical manuka honey of honeydew, polyfloral and chestnut honey.
The levels of antibiotic residues on these honeys were below the limit of quantification.
Based on our results the Italian variety of honeydew showed the best antimicrobial activity and can be considered for the treatment of infected wounds in animals.


Abstract
Despite their closure, cases of asbestos-related occupational diseases among former asbestos workers are still being recorded in the Central Register of Occupational Diseases.


Abstract
The reasons offered for not asking respondents to report their status are that responses may be inaccurate and that asking about HIV status may violate the respondents' human rights and exacerbate stigma and discrimination.
It is also important for estimating the true size of the unmet needs in addressing the HIV epidemic and for interpreting the behaviours associated with the acquisition and transmission of HIV infection correctly.
The data available indicate that most participants in health-related surveys are willing to respond to a question about HIV status - as one of possibly several sensitive questions about sexual and drug use behaviours.
Ultimately, normalizing the self-reporting of HIV status could help the global community move from an era of so-called exceptionalism to one of destigmatization - and so improve the epidemic response worldwide.


Abstract
With efforts focused on the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus, less attention has been given to tetanus incidence and mortality among men.
Since 2007 voluntary medical male circumcision has been scaled-up in 14 sub-Saharan African countries as an effective intervention to reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition among men.
As part of a review of adverse events from these programmes, we identified 13 cases of tetanus from five countries reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) up to March 2016.
Eight patients died and only one patient had a known history of tetanus vaccination.
Tetanus after voluntary medical male circumcision was rare among more than 11 million procedures conducted.
Nevertheless, the cases prompted a review of the evidence on tetanus vaccination coverage and case notifications in sub-Saharan Africa, supplemented by a literature review of non-neonatal tetanus in Africa over the years 2003-2014.
The WHO African Region reported the highest number of non-neonatal tetanus cases per million population and lowest historic coverage of tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine.
Coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine ranged from 65% to 98% across the 14 countries in 2013.
In hospital-based studies, non-neonatal tetanus comprised 0.3-10.7% of admissions, and a median of 71% of patients were men.
The identification of tetanus cases following voluntary medical male circumcision highlights a gender gap in tetanus morbidity disproportionately affecting men.
Incorporating tetanus vaccination for boys and men into national programmes should be a priority to align with the goal of universal health coverage.


Abstract
Occurring for the first time in 1986 in the United Kingdom, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the so-called "mad-cow disease", has had unprecedented consequences in veterinary public health.


Abstract
In barns with an automatic milking system (AMS), both the milking frequency and the number of nighttime milkings vary between cows.
A low milking frequency might indicate problems in gaining access to the milking unit.
Nocturnal melatonin levels tended to be negatively associated with the number of nighttime milkings.


Abstract
In the year 2015, 93 reports (124 in the year 2014) of adverse reactions following the application of various vaccines were received.
The distribution among species remained similar within previous years.
Companion animals were involved in most of the reports (38% dogs, 17% cats), followed by horses (16%) and cows (12%).
The last 13 years since the introduction of this scheme are reviewed.

s®, Belgium).
The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was 54.0% and found 7 to 20 days post natum, whereas 47.1% were suffering from diarrhea.
Halofuginone (Halocur®) is approved for prophylaxis against cryptosporidiosis, but it showed no effect on the excretion of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the present study.


Abstract
The results show that the number of treatments per year decreased compared to previous studies.


Abstract
Metabolically stressed cows entering at least their 3rd lactation (n = 200, parity: 5.0 ± 2.1, mean ± SD) were selected from a field study conducted in Switzerland.
Age of cows at culling ranged from 4.7 to 20.2 years with parities from 3 to 17.


Abstract
Nutrient intake of infants and toddlers in the United Arab Emirates: the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study.
This descriptive study evaluated the nutrient adequacy of the diet of infants (aged 6-11.9 months) and toddlers (aged 12-24 months) in the United Arab Emirates.
A random sample of 1000 infants and toddlers was recruited from 2 cities (Al Ain and Dubai) from March 2011 to February 2012 and their usual nutrient intake was determined using 24-hour recall.
In all, 54.2% of infants and 25.2% of toddlers were breastfeeding.
In toddlers, mean energy intake for girls in Al Ain and Dubai was 1032.8 (SD 252) kcal and 1013 (SD 339.1) kcal respectively and 1057.2 (SD 201.8) kcal and 1030.3 (SD 341.7) kcal for boys.
Iron intake was low in both groups.
Mean body mass index and body weight and height were similar to World Health Organization figures but significant numbers of infants and toddlers of both sexes were over- or underweight.
Although mean energy and macronutrient intakes were comparable to the RDA, significant numbers were over- or underfed.


Abstract
Prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders among school children in Saudi Arabia: results of a national iodine nutrition study.
This study aimed at establishing updated data on iodine nutrition among schoolchildren in Saudi Arabia.
A cross-sectional cluster survey among schoolchildren aged 8-10 years was conducted during February-April 2012.
Children were clinically examined for goitre, urine and household salt samples were collected to estimate urinary iodine concenteration (UIC) and iodine content in salt.
The overall goitre prevalence at the national level among 4 016 children was 4.2%.
The prevalence was < 5% in all regions of the country except southern region with a prevalence of 12.7%.
The median UIC of 2224 samples was 133 μg/L, with 74.3% of the surveyed children with UIC ≥ 100 μg/L.
Analysis of salt samples (n = 4242) revealed that 69.8% of households were consuming adequately iodized salt.


Abstract
Customer's self-audit to improve the technical quality of maternity care in Tabriz: a community trial.
Pregnant women have a major role to play in assessing and improving their own quality of care.
This study in Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran, aimed to assess the effectiveness of an intervention for pregnant women-based on education and support groups and involvement in quality assessment activities-in order to improve the technical quality of public maternity care at public health centres.
The intervention phase began in September 2011 and lasted 8 months.
The outcome measure was health-care providers' degree of adherence to the Iranian maternity care standards.
An intervention group of 92 pregnant women from 10 health centres was compared with a control group of 93 pregnant women from 11 centres.
Logistic regression analysis showed that the self-assessed technical quality of maternity care received by the women was significantly better in the intervention that the control group for several of the standards concerning clinical examinations, maternal education and vitamin and mineral supplements.


Abstract
Psychometric properties of the Social Cognitive Theory questionnaire for physical activity in a sample of Iranian adolescent girl students.
This research examined the validity and reliability of a researcher-developed questionnaire based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) to assess the physical activity behaviour of Iranian adolescent girls (SCT-PAIAGS).
Psychometric properties of the SCT-PAIAGS were assessed by determining its face validity, content and construct validity as well as its reliability.
In order to evaluate factor structure, cross-sectional research was conducted on 400 high-school girls in Tehran.
Content validity index, content validity ratio and impact score for the SCT-PAIAGS varied between 0.97-1, 0.91-1 and 4.6-4.9 respectively.
Confirmatory factor analysis approved a six-factor structure comprising self-efficacy, self-regulation, family support, friend support, outcome expectancy and self-efficacy to overcoming impediments.
Factor loadings, t-values and fit indices showed that the SCT model was fitted to the data.
Cronbach's α-coefficient ranged from 0.78 to 0.85 and intraclass correlation coefficient from 0.73 to 0.90.


Abstract
Development of a method for classification of hospitals based on results of the diagnosis-related groups and the principle of case-mix index.
These scores were used to assess the performances of teaching hospitals in Damascus.
The linear correlations between these scores and the annual amount of waste and DRGs values were studied.
The differences between the daily waste generations before and after the adjustment process were determined.
Accordingly, the highest values of DRGs and CMI Scores were for the pediatric and Al Assad hospitals respectively.
Among the teaching hospitals in Damascus, Al Assad has achieved the highest performance.
Based on the results, the accuracy and homogeneity of medical waste generation rates were improved, which in turn leads to continuous improvement in the management of medical wastes.


Abstract
A qualitative study on a 30-year trend of tobacco use and tobacco control programmes in Islamic Republic of Iran.
We conducted in-depth interviews with key tobacco control policy-makers to explore their views and opinions of trends in tobacco use and the effectiveness of tobacco control programmes over the past 3 decades.
A qualitative interview study was conducted in 2014 using a grounded theory approach.
In-depth interviews were conducted with 86 key tobacco control policy-makers and data collection was based on principles of saturation.
The core code "tobacco consumption and its control programme" was extracted and its related themes were listed.
After review and classification by an expert panel, 9 categorized codes emerged.
The final 31 codes were ordered according to their conceptual differentiations.


Abstract
Characterization of invasive Neisseria meningitidis strains isolated at the Children's Hospital of Tunis, Tunisia.
Neisseria meningitidis, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious infections, is responsible for approximately one-third of cases of bacterial meningitis in the Children's Hospital of Tunis.
The serogroup distribution, antibiotic susceptibility and antigenic and molecular characteristics of N. meningitidis isolates were determined in patients aged 3 days-13 years between February 1998 and June 2013.
In all 107 invasive strains of N. meningitidis were isolated.
Reduced susceptibility to penicillin G was seen in 55.7% of isolates, with a low level of resistance in all cases; 28.4% showed a low level of resistance to amoxicillin.
Serogroup B isolates were the most frequent (80.4%), followed by serogroups C (12.2%) and A (5.6%).
Isolates of serogroup A had the same antigenic formula (A:4:P1.9), the same variable regions VR1, VR2 and VR3, and belonged to the same clonal complex (CC5).
Isolates of serogroups B and C were more heterogeneous with several antigenic formulae.
The most frequent clonal complex in these isolates was CC35.
Serogroup B accounted for a large percentage of our isolates with marked diversity.


Abstract
Zika virus: no cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region but concerns remain.
The meetings provided up-to-date information on the current situation and agreed on a set of actions for the countries to undertake to enhance their preparedness and response capacities to Zika virus infection and its complications.
The most urgent action is to enhance both epidemiological and entomological surveillance between now and the coming rainy seasons in countries with known presence of Aedes mosquitoes.
Zika virus like other vector-borne diseases poses a particular challenge to the countries because of their complex nature which requires multidisciplinary competencies and strong rapid interaction among committed sectors.
WHO is working closely with partners and countries to ensure the optimum support is provided to the countries to reduce the risk of this newly emerged health threat.


Abstract
In the present study, risk factors for the use of oral antibiotics in weaned piglets were collected on 112 pig farms by a personal questionaire.
The most common indication for an antibiotic group therapy was diarrhoea, and the most frequently used antibiotic was Colistin.
On average, 27.33 daily doses in the control farms and 387.21 daily doses in the problem farms per 1000 weaners were administered on a given day.
Furthermore, the treatment incidence of weaners for oral antibiotics was calculated on the basis of the drug inventory.


Abstract
The goal of this study was to measure this force and to investigate whether the Tekscan F-SCAN in-shoe pressure measuring system is suitable for quantification of the impact strength of a kick from a horse.
In addition, each kicking event was recorded with a video camera for subjective evaluation.


Abstract
A questionnaire on signs of HAC was used and a clinical score calculated as the sum of the 9 questions.
Eighteen questionnaires at diagnosis and 97 during therapy were filled out by owners of 32 dogs.
An ACTH-stimulation test was performed at each reevaluation.
There were weak correlations between abdominal girth, appetite or weight gain and cortisol concentrations during therapy.
However, the clinical score did not correlate with cortisol or cACTH values.
If low-dose trilostane is used, treatment frequency often has to be increased.


Abstract
Regarding medical cases (29.5%) the most frequent finding was unspecified weakness (47.8%).
Ophthalmic pathologies were diagnosed in 9% of the patients.
With respect to outcome 41.7% of the patients could be released, 47.3% and 11.0% had to be euthanized or died, respectively.
In 6 of 9 of the most frequently presented species the rate of release increased significantly compared to the previous study.


Abstract
Allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT) is the only etiologic treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs.
In humans it has been shown that intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) enhanced efficacy and patient compliance and reduced treatment time from 3 years to 8 weeks.
As only safety data have been published yet, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of ILIT in dogs.
20 atopic dogs underwent ILIT with alum-precipitated allergens administered every 4 weeks for 3 to 7 times in the popliteal lymph node.
The median number of injections was 5.6.
All dogs tolerated the procedure well and no adverse effects were recognized during or after ILIT.
Therefore ILIT should be regarded as a safe alternative to subucaneous ASIT, enabling a faster clinical improvement with the same response rate.


Abstract
Deaths of children aged under 5 years and related factors in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a populationbased case-control study.
The study was conducted to determine the family, social and economic factors associated with deaths of children aged under 5 years.
A registry-based nested case-control study was conducted of the deaths of all children aged under 5 years in Kohgilooyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
For each death, two controls were randomly selected among children of the same age, sex and place of residence (186 cases and 372 controls).
Congenital abnormality (37.6%) and preterm birth (29.0%) were the two most frequent causes of death among children aged under 5 years.
No vaccine-preventable disease was reported as the cause of death.
The strongest associations were found with consanguinity of the parents (OR = 3.92; 95% CI = 2.27-6.85 for being first cousins in comparison with no family relation; P < 0.001) and with domestic violence to the mother during pregnancy (OR = 3.13; 95% CI = 1.60-6.17; P < 0.01).
The main causes of death of children aged under 5 years in the Province were congenital abnormality and prematurity.


Abstract
Collaboration between pharmacists and general practitioners in the health care system in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Collaboration between pharmacists and general practitioners (GPs) has been shown to enhance patient care and outcomes.
We distributed 318 questionnaires to community pharmacists and GPs in Tehran.
Both groups preferred communication by telephone or face-toface communication by fax or letter.
The two groups expressed concern about possible fragmentation of patient care with the involvement of multiple health care providers, and perceived lack of face-to-face communication as a possible barrier to collaboration.


Abstract
Direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceuticals in Jordan from a gender perspective.
This study aimed to investigate the extent to which direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) for pharmaceuticals is disseminated in Jordan and to identify subsequent gender differences.
The study was conducted on two samples: 1) patients (drug consumers) attending Jordan University Hospital, and 2) physicians working at the hospital (prescribers).
A questionnaire was distributed to male and female patients (n=550), and based on its results a second questionnaire was designed and distributed to male and female physicians (n=200).
The response rate was 93% for patients and 72% for physicians.
Although the Jordanian Drug and Pharmacy Law prohibits the public promotion of medicines, consumers remain exposed to pharmaceutical advertising.
The top ten drug classes advertised directly to consumers in Jordan included prescription-only drugs.
Approximately 45% of the two samples agreed that women were more likely to be targeted by DTCA, while only 2% of them believed that men are more likely to be targeted.
However, there was no statistically significant gender difference in attitudes towards pharmaceutical DTCA and tools used.


Abstract
Burden and associated factors for caregivers of the elderly in a developing country.
The elderly population in South Asia is growing.
In Pakistan trained caregivers are scarce and culturally not acceptable.
This study assessed the level of stress experienced by caregivers of the elderly and determined the association of care giving burden with different characteristics of the elderly.
A cross-sectional, questionnaire based study was conducted using nonprobability purposive sampling.
All consenting participants aged 60 years and above needing help with at least one activity of daily living or two instrumental activities of daily living were included.
350 participants were assessed for perceived care giver burden.
Care providers were mostly female (68.9%).
Half (50.3%) of the caregivers had a positive score on a perceived care burden scale.
Financial impact had a strong correlation (0.79) with perceived caregiver burden.
Higher dependency levels of a physical and cognitive nature posed greater burden on caregivers.
Behavioural issues of the elderly such as verbal abuse and difficulty sleeping were predictors of a higher caregiver burden.
Caregiver burden is a significant issue for those caring for elderly family members in Karachi, Pakistan.


Abstract
Adherence of preventive oral care products in the Syrian market to evidence-based international recommendations.
No study has investigated the availability and adherence of preventive oral care products on the Syrian market to evidence-based international recommendations.
Data were collected in 2012, and updated in 2016, in terms of availability, characteristics and adherence to evidence-based international recommendations.
Few preventive products adhered to the recommendations.
Despite the large decrease in the number of oral care products on the Syrian market, due to the Syrian crisis, nonadherence of some of the available products is still present.
A multisectorial approach at a policy level is needed to address such important limitations.


Abstract
Association between oral health knowledge and practices of Saudi pregnant women in Dammam, Saudi Arabia.
This study assessed the association between oral health knowledge and practices of pregnant Saudi women selected from visitors to a government hospital in Dammam, Saudi Arabia in 2014.
Women answered questions on oral health knowledge during pregnancy and knowledge of infant oral health.
Most women (> 80%) performed oral hygiene procedures but only 18% regularly visited the dentist.
In a regression analysis, oral health knowledge was not significantly associated with reported oral hygiene practices.
Women who visited the dentist regularly were more likely to know how to prevent caries in children, and that dental treatment during pregnancy and infant health were associated.


Abstract
Primary healthcare reform in the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
In response, in 2011 UNRWA initiated an Agency-wide programme of primary healthcare reform, informed by the Chronic Care Model framework.
An inclusive clinical information system, termed e-Health, was implemented to collect a wide range of health information, with a focus on continuity of treatment.
UNRWA was able to bring about these wide-ranging changes within its existing resources, reallocating finances, reforming its payment mechanisms, and modernizing its drug-procurement policies.
While specific components of UNRWA's primary healthcare reform are showing promising results, additional efforts are needed to empower patients further and to strengthen involvement of the community.


Abstract
A comprehensive cardiovascular examination is crucial for diagnosis and assessment of the severity of disease.
These include mitral, aortic and tricuspid insufficiency, ventricular septal defects, atrial fibrillation as well as supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.
Horses with complex ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension or congestive heart failure must not be ridden or driven and should be retired.


Abstract
'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' is an emerging tick-borne zoonotic agent that primarily affects immunocompromised human patients.
This is the first study to systematically investigate the occurrence of 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' in Canidae in Europa.
All samples were tested using a previously described multiplex real-time PCR for the Anaplasmataceae family, the 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia' genus and the 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis' species.
All Anaplasmataceae positive samples were subsequently tested using specific real-time PCRs for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis and Rickettsia helvetica.
Among the tested animals, one dog from Zurich tested positive for 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis'.
Fanconi syndrome was diagnosed based on glucosuria with normoglycemia and hyperaminoaciduria.
A. platys and E. canis were detected in 14/249 dogs from Sicily and Portugal; two of the dogs were coinfected with both agents.


Abstract
In 8 dogs the cause of bleeding initially was suspected to be a minor trauma or a surgical complication, and various surgical approaches had been undertaken to eliminate the problem.
In only 3 dogs respiratory signs were observed before the bleeding prompted referral.
The median time elapsed between the first recognized clinical signs attributed to A. vasorum until diagnosis was 2 weeks (range1 day to 4 months).
Four dogs died, 3 on the day of admission and 1 dog 4 days after admission.
Suspected causes of death were respiratory failure and cerebral hemorrhage in 2 dogs each.
Four dogs had been pre-treated with NSAIDs; of these, 2 dogs developed severe hemoptysis (1 died), 1 dog developed brain hemorrhage (and died), and 1 dog developed a large subcutaneous hematoma with marked anemia.
Bleeding at various sites may be the only recognized abnormality in A. vasorum infection.
Without a high index of suspicion, the diagnosis and appropriate therapy may be delayed to the point of a fatal outcome.


Abstract
Of 884 stones analysed 50% (n=441) were composed of calcium oxalate, 45% (n=398) of struvite, 3% (n=18) of ammonium urate, 1% (n=12) were mixed stones, 1% (n=9) were composed of silica, 3 stones were solidified blood, 2 consisted of cystine and 1of xanthine.
40% of the ureteral stones were composed of struvite.
Domestic cats had significantly less calcium oxalate stones compared to British Shorthair or Persian cats.
Cats with calcium oxalate stones were older and cats with struvite stones were younger than other affected cats.
Compared to studies from other countries, in Switzerland silica stones occurred more often and ureteral stones were more often composed of Struvite.
The present study shows that occurrence and prevalence of urinary calculi of cats from Switzerland exhibited only slight differences to studies from other countries.

There are currently no objective accepted diagnostic criteria for the clinical detection of MTrP, nor are there standardized diagnostic criteria for MPS.
Two promising areas of research with potential for enhancing the diagnosis of MPS include the use of diagnostic ultrasound and biomarkers.
Further research is needed to advance the development of composite diagnostic criteria employing ultrasound imaging, biomarker assessments and physical assessment to enhance the accuracy and objectivity of MTrP detection and diagnosis of chronic MPS disorder.


Abstract
The purpose of this study was to measure passive hip internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) range of motion (ROM) in collegiate baseball pitchers and compare to published youth and professional values.
Measures were taken on the bilateral hips of 29 participants (mean age 20.0±1.4, range 18-22 years).
Results identified no significant differences between the stance and stride hip in collegiate right handed pitchers for IR (p= 0.22, ES 0.23) and ER (p=.08, ES= 0.25).
There was no significant difference in left handed pitchers for IR (p= 0.80, ES= 0.11) and ER (p= 0.56, ES= 0.15).
When comparing youth to collegiate, IR increased in the stance (2º) and stride (5º) hip and an increase in the stance (5º) and stride (5º) hip were present for ER as well.
From collegiate to professional, IR increased in the stance (4º) and stride (3º) hip whereas a decrease in the stance (9º) and stride (12º) hip was present for ER.
The data suggests an increase in passive ROM from youth to collegiate and a decrease from collegiate to professional.
Understanding passive hip ROM values among the different levels of pitchers may assist clinicians in developing time dependent interventions to prevent future injury and enhance performance.


Abstract
Estimation of influenza and severe acute respiratory illness incidence (burden) in three provinces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2012 and 2013.
There are few estimates of influenza burden in the WHO Region for the Eastern Mediterranean.
The age groups most at-risk were children aged under 2 years and adults older than 50 years.


Abstract
Characteristics of severe acute respiratory infectionassociated hospitalization in Yemen, 2014/15.
This study aims to describe etiological agents, demographic details of patients, seasonality and underlying conditions among patients hospitalized due to viral severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in Yemen.
We carried out a retrospective descriptive analysis of data from January 2014 to December 2015.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from each patient for laboratory testing.
A total of 1346 diagnostic specimens were tested, of which 733 (54%) were positive for influenza viruses.
Influenza A(H3) and A(H1N1) pdm09 predominated.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was reported predominantly among children (41%).
Males (61%) were more affected than females.
The median age was 1 year (range 0.5-94.0).
The median length of hospitalization was 6 days.
Chronic cardiovascular disease was the most commonly reported underlying condition, but 67% had no documented underlying disease.


Abstract
Contribution of laboratories in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region to the selection of candidate seasonal influenza vaccine, 2010-2015.
The World Health Organization (WHO) formulates recommendations for viruses to be included in vaccines for the influenza seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres on the basis of analyses by its collaborating centres (CCs).
This report describes the contribution of influenza laboratories and national influenza centres in countries in the WHO Region for the Eastern Mediterranean to the selection process of seasonal and pre-pandemic influenza virus subtypes.
Data submitted by 22 countries to FluNet and FluID between September 2010 and June 2015 were analysed.
National Influenza Centres (NICs) in 12 countries (55%) reported data, 5 (23%) to both FluNet and FluID and 7 (32%) only to FluNet.
The WHO CC in London characterized 78% of the samples, and the CC in Atlanta, characterized 21%.
The contribution of influenza laboratories and NICs from this Region to global influenza surveillance is appreciable.


Abstract
Detection of influenza B viruses with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitor in Morocco during 2014/15 season.
We monitored phenotypic and genotypic susceptibility of influenza viruses circulating in Morocco during 2014-2015 to oseltamivir and zanamivir.
Sixty influenza B viruses isolated from MDCK cells showed no significant resistance to NAIs.
However, two of these strains, B/Morocco/176H/2015 and B/Morocco/CP10/2015, showed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir.
The two influenza B viruses with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir show that ongoing NAI susceptibility surveillance is essential.


Abstract
Modelling of seasonal influenza and estimation of the burden in Tunisia.
The burden of influenza was estimated from surveillance data in Tunisia using epidemiological parameters of transmission with WHO classical tools and mathematical modelling.
The incidence rates of influenza-associated influenza-like illness (ILI) per 100 000 were 18 735 in 2012/2013 season; 5536 in 2013/14 and 12 602 in 2014/15.
The estimated proportions of influenza-associated ILI in the total outpatient load were 3.16%; 0.86% and 1.98% in the 3 seasons respectively.
Distribution of influenza viruses among positive patients was: A(H3N2) 15.5%; A(H1N1)pdm2009 39.2%; and B virus 45.3% in 2014/2015 season.
Running the model for the different values of R0, we quantified the number of symptomatic clinical cases, the clinical attack rates, the symptomatic clinical attack rates and the number of deaths.
More realistic versions of this model and improved estimates of parameters from surveillance data will strengthen the estimation of the burden of influenza.


Abstract
An outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) due to coronavirus in Al-Ahssa Region, Saudi Arabia, 2015.
Between 19 April and 23 June 2015, 52 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome due to coronavirus (MERS) were reported from Al-Ahssa region, eastern Saudi Arabia.
The first seven cases occurred in one family; these were followed by 45 cases in three public hospitals.
The objectives of this investigation were to describe the epidemiological characteristic of the cluster and identify potential risk factors and control measures to be instituted to prevent further occurrence of MERS.
We obtained the medical records of all confirmed cases, interviewed the members of the affected household and reviewed the actions taken by the health authorities.
All the cases were connected.
The index case was a 62-year-old man with a history of close contact with dromedary camels; three of the seven infected family members and 18 people in hospitals died (case-fatality rate, 40.4%).
The median incubation period was about 6 days.
The cluster of cases appeared to be due to high exposure to MERS, delayed diagnosis, inadequate risk communication and inadequate compliance of hospital health workers and visitors with infection prevention and control measures.


Abstract
Capacity of the national influenza surveillance system in Afghanistan, a chronic conflict setting.
Influenza surveillance is needed to monitor potential public health threats from the emergence of novel influenza viruses.
This study assessed the capacity and performance of the national influenza surveillance system in Afghanistan from 2007 to 2014.


Abstract
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in young infants, little was known on its circulation types and patterns in Morocco.
We conducted a prospective study using sentinel-based influenza surveillance to detect RSV by real time PCR in patients with acute respiratory infections, enrolled during two seasons (2014/15, 2015/16).
During September 2014-April 2016, we obtained 1450 specimens, of which 267(18.4%) tested positive for RSV.
The proportion of positive RSV infection was higher in patients hospitalized with acute respiratory infection compared to those with mild symptoms in out-patient clinics.
The proportion of RSV infection was highest in children aged 0-6 months (45%; P < 0.001).
Higher positivity rate was observed between months of December and March.
RSV remains important viral etiological agent causing influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections especially among infants in Morocco.
Further surveillance, is required to understand better the risk factors of RSV infections.


Abstract
Understanding the genetic evolution of A(H1N1)pdm09 and H3N2 viruses can help better select strains to be included in the annual influenza vaccine.
For H3N2, we generated 20 HA and 19 NA sequences and included 19 published HA and NA sequences each in the analysis.
Jordanian H1N1 viruses had mutations that are characteristic of antigenic group 6 while H3N2 virus mutations belonged to group 3.
No markers of resistance to oseltamivir were detected.
The individual mutations are described in detail.


Abstract
Incidence of influenza virus-associated severe acute respiratory infection in Damanhour district, Egypt, 2013.
The epidemiology, seasonality and risk factors for influenza virus infection remains poorly defined in countries such as Egypt.
Between 1 January and 31 December 2013, we used surveillance data on patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection in three Egyptian government hospitals in Damanhour district to estimate the incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza.
Samples were taken from 1727 of 1856 patients; of these, 19% were influenza virus positive.
The overall incidence of influenza virus-associated SARI during the study period was estimated to be 44 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 39-48).
The highest incidence of 166 cases per 100 000 person year (95% CI: 125-220) was observed in children aged 2 to 4 years.
The incidence of influenza-virus associated SARI cases in pregnant women was estimated to be 17.3 cases per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 6-54).
Majority of influenza virus-associated SARI occurred in autumn and early winter, and influenza A(H3N2) virus predominated.
However, additional works are needed for greater understanding of influenza burden in Egypt.


Abstract
Burden of acute respiratory disease of epidemic and pandemic potential in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region: A literature review.
There are gaps in the knowledge about the burden of severe respiratory disease in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).
Relevant published and unpublished reports were identified from searches of various databases; 83 documents fulfilled the search criteria.
The infections identified included: ARI, avian influenza A(H5N1), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.
Pneumonia and ARIs were leading causes of disease and death in the Region.
Influenza A(H1N1) was an important cause of morbidity during the 2009 pandemic.
This review provides a descriptive summary of the burden of acute respiratory diseases in the Region, but there still remains a lack of necessary data.


Abstract
Influenza virus positivity and circulating subtypes among cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection, Egypt, 2012-2015.
Information on the prevalence of influenza, circulating virus subtypes and seasonality is essential for selecting strains for annual vaccines and for planning immunization programmes.
Data were obtained from the 13 sentinel surveillance sites throughout Egypt during 2012-2015.
The seasonality of influenza in ILI cases was November- February, and that in SARI cases was November-March, peaking in January.


Abstract
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus: current knowledge and future considerations.
Major databases were searched and relevant published papers and reports during 2012-2015 were reviewed.
The collected results suggest that much remains to be discovered about MERS-CoV.


Abstract
Characterization of influenza outbreaks in Lebanon during the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons.
Despite the significant burden of influenza outbreaks, active disease monitoring has been largely absent in the Middle East, including Lebanon.
In this study we characterized influenza virus in 440 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients with acute respiratory infections during two influenza seasons in Lebanon.
Influenza A(H3N2) was dominant in the 2013/14 season while the A(H1N1)pdm09 and B/Yamagata strains were most prevalent in the 2014/15 season.
All tested isolates were susceptible to 4 neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir).
Genetic analysis of the haemagglutinin gene revealed multiple introductions of influenza viruses into Lebanon from different geographic sources during each season.
Additionally, large data gaps were identified in the Middle East region, as indicated by the lack of current influenza sequences in the database from many countries in the region.


Abstract
The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: lessons learnt and future strategy.
A novel strain of influenza A virus H1N1 surfaced in Mexico in April 2009 and quickly spread across the globe, turning an epidemic into a pandemic.
Within two months, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international health emergency and raised the threat bar from level V to level VI, i.e. containment to mitigation.
During this time, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean worked closely with its Member States, other stakeholders and WHO headquarters to manage the situation.
Programme documents were reviewed and key personnel interviewed for this study.
A hallmark of the response was the establishment of the Strategic Health Operations Centre to bring together experts from different technical backgrounds at regional level.
Several lessons were learnt that can provide the basis for standard operating procedures, protocols and guidelines for emergency events in future.


Abstract
Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Egyptian poultry, 2015.
Up to 2011, all the detected viruses were H5N1, and the overall prevalence was 5%.
In 2011, H9N2 viruses were observed to be co-circulating and co-infecting the same hosts as H5N1 viruses.
Since then, the detection rate has increased to around 10%.
In the 2014-2015 winter season, H5N1 was circulating heavily in poultry flocks and caused an unprecedented number of human infections.


Abstract
While the prevalence of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) on chicken farms in some provinces of Canada has been documented, the economic impact of variant IBDV infection on the broiler chicken industry in Saskatchewan has not.
The objectives of this study were to identify the variant strains of IBDV circulating on Saskatchewan chicken farms and evaluate their economic impact on broiler production.
Flocks positive for IBDV had mean mortality of 8.6% and mean condemnation of 1.5%.
In contrast, mean mortality in uninfected flocks was 6.1% and mean condemnation was 1.1%.


Abstract
Papillomas occur more frequently in cattle than other domestic animals.
The causal agent of bovine papillomatosis is a virus that belongs to the family Papillomaviridae.


Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be devastating to commercial breeding operations.
The objective of this study was to evaluate a novel European PRRSV vaccinal strain for safety and efficacy in bred gilts.
In 2 experiments, 110 gilts were vaccinated intramuscularly and the vaccine was evaluated for safety and efficacy.
Gilts in Experiment 1 were evaluated for local and systemic reactions and gilts in both experiments were observed for clinical signs of disease through farrow.
In both experiments, piglet clinical observations, piglet average daily weight gain (ADWG), gilt serology [determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)], gilt and piglet viremia [determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)], as well as piglet lung lesion scores and PRRS virus in lung tissue (qPCR) were determined.
The vaccine was shown to be safe as there were no significant differences among groups in either experiment.
Efficacy was established in Experiment 2 as both vaccinated groups were associated with desirable significant differences in percentage of gilts with abnormal clinical findings; gilt viral load post-challenge [day 125, day of farrowing (DOF), and DOF + 13]; percentages of alive, healthy live, weak live, and mummified piglets per litter at farrowing and weaning; percentage of piglets per gilt that were positive for viremia; percentage of piglets per gilt with clinical disease; and piglet viral load on DOF.
It was concluded that a vaccine formulated from the PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) strain 94881 is a safe and effective method of protection against the detrimental effects of virulent PRRSV infection in breeding female pigs.


Abstract
Use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of equine adipose tissue has promising applications for regenerative therapies.
The most commonly used source of equine adipose tissue is the subcutaneous tailhead.
The objective of this study was to compare 3 adipose depot sites in horses and determine the viability and cellular yield, capillary density, gene expression for selected markers, and colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-Fs) in adipose tissue taken from these sites.
Adipose tissue was excised from the area lateral to the tailhead, the inguinal region, and the small colon mesentery of 6 horses.
Lipoaspirate was also collected from the area lateral to the tailhead.
Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was prepared in duplicate from the 3 different adipose tissue depots.
The total nucleated and dead cell counts was determined manually using a hemocytometer and percent viability was calculated.
Mass and volume of adipose were determined in order to calculate density and factor-VIII immunohistochemical staining was used to determine vascular density in the excisional adipose tissue samples from each horse.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to quantify gene expression for selected cellular markers from each site.
There were significant differences in viability, yield of nucleated cells/gram of adipose tissue, vascular density, gene expression, and CFU-Fs among adipose depots.
Adipose from the mesentery yielded the highest number of nucleated cells/gram of tissue and the highest vascular density and percentage of CFU-Fs.
In the horse, both the anatomical site of collection and the method of tissue collection significantly impact the yield and composition of cells in the SVF.
Further study is needed to assess whether one adipose source is superior for harvesting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and whether the differences among sources are clinically relevant for in-vivo treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in horses.


Abstract
The only way to diagnose hepatic fibrosis in dogs is by histological assessment of a liver biopsy specimen.
The objective of this study was to assess the utility of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) as serum markers of canine hepatic fibrosis.
Serum samples were collected from 47 dogs with histologically confirmed hepatobiliary disease and 24 healthy dogs in order to measure concentrations of HA, PIIINP, and TIMP-1.
Hepatic fibrosis was staged using a 5-point scoring scheme.
There was no correlation between serum concentrations of HA or PIIINP and the severity of hepatic fibrosis.


Abstract
Breast tumors are the most common tumors in dogs and the study of disease prognostic factors is important for establishing the appropriate treatment protocols.
The purpose of this study was to clinically stage mammary tumors of bitches and correlate the stages with histological type and grade.
The tumors of 63 dogs were clinically staged based on the findings of tumor sizing, lymph node evaluation, and radiographic examination.
After surgical excision, the tumors were classified histologically and graded.
The relationship between the tumor grade, stage, and histological type was evaluated using a binomial test.
Stage I tumors were the most numerous (31.75%), followed by tumors at stages II, III, IV, and V. Animals with histological grade I carcinomas presented stage I, II, or III tumors more frequently and stage IV and V tumors less frequently.
The number of animals with simple carcinomas that were at stage I of the disease was greater than that at stage V. Carcinomas in the mixed tumors were less aggressive; however, the small number of animals in stage V of the disease made any statistical association impossible.
The complex carcinomas presented with the invasion of the lymph nodes and less cellular differentiation in a larger number of animals than did simple carcinomas.
Histological grading proved to be the best parameter for the prognostic evaluation of the breast carcinomas.


Abstract
The sedative effect of acepromazine combined with 2 doses of tramadol [3 and 5 mg/kg body weight (BW)] was compared with the sedative effect of acepromazine alone in dogs and the effects of each sedative protocol on cardiorespiratory variables were examined.
This was a prospective, randomized, blinded, crossover study.
Each of 6 dogs received 3 treatments at 1-week intervals.
During all anesthetic episodes, dogs received 0.05 mg/kg BW acepromazine.
Approximately 25 min later, dogs were given physiological saline (control) or tramadol [3 mg/kg BW (TR3) or 5 mg/kg BW (TR5)].
All drugs were administered intravenously.
Variables evaluated included heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures (SAP, MAP, and DAP), and sedation [by use of a simple descriptive scale (SDS, range: 0 to 3) and a numeric rating scale (NRS, range: 0 to 10)].
Variables were recorded 25 min after acepromazine and for 80 min after saline or tramadol.
Acepromazine administration resulted in mild sedation in most dogs and decreased RR, SAP, MAP, and DAP in all treatments.
Tramadol administration did not significantly increase SDS or NRS scores compared to acepromazine alone.
The only exception to this rule was observed at 20 min after TR3, when NRS was higher in this group than in the control treatment.
Administration of tramadol (TR3 and TR5) decreased HR.
Under the conditions of this study, sedation induced by acepromazine with tramadol was similar to that of acepromazine alone.
The main adverse effects of the combination were a decrease in blood pressure and HR, without clinical significance.


Abstract
Beyond this diagnostic role, there has been an explosion in definitive gene discovery in a range of neuropsychiatric diseases.
Here, we outline these developments and chart the expected impact on the treatment of neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disease.


Abstract
Every human is unique.
We differ in our genomes, environment, behavior, disease history, and past and current medical treatment-a complex catalog of differences that often leads to variations in the way each of us responds to a particular therapy.
We argue here that true personalization of drug therapies will rely on "virtual patient" models based on a detailed characterization of the individual patient by molecular, imaging, and sensor techniques.


Abstract
Postmortem human tissues are available from many biobanks; nevertheless, collections of neuronal human cells from large patient cohorts representing the human diversity remain scarce.
This review examines and contrasts the advantages and limitations of each tool for personalized medicine research.


Abstract
Functional brain connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a popular technique for investigating neural organization in both healthy subjects and patients with mental illness.
Despite a rapidly growing body of literature, however, functional connectivity research has yet to deliver biomarkers that can aid psychiatric diagnosis or prognosis at the single-subject level.
Here, we review recent evidence that functional connectivity profiles are both reliable within subjects and unique across subjects, and that features of these profiles relate to behavioral phenotypes.
Together, these results suggest the potential to discover reliable correlates of present and future illness and/or response to treatment in the strength of an individual's functional brain connections.
Ultimately, this work could help develop personalized approaches to psychiatric illness.


Abstract
This review concerns epigenetic mechanisms and their roles in conferring interindividual differences, especially as related to experientially acquired and genetically driven changes in central nervous system (CNS) function.
The review begins with a basic description of epigenetic marking in the CNS and how these changes are powerful regulators of gene readout.
Means for characterizing the individual epigenotype are briefly described, with a focus on DNA cytosine methylation as a readily measurable, stable epigenetic mark.
Finally, the commentary addresses two exemplars when considering how epigenotype may correlate with and modulate cognitive and behavioral phenotype: schizophrenia and Rett syndrome.


Abstract
The development of massively parallel sequencing (or next-generation sequencing) has facilitated a rapid implementation of genomic sequencing in clinical medicine.
Genomic sequencing (GS) is now an essential tool for evaluating rare disorders, identifying therapeutic targets in neoplasms, and screening for prenatal aneuploidy.


Abstract
Although drug selection and dose adaptation according to cytochrome P450 genotypes are sound, a large number of patients need to be genotyped in order to prevent one case of severe side effect and/or nonresponse.
The decrease in cost for genetic analysis shifts the cost: benefit ratio toward increasing use of pharmacogenetic tests.


Abstract
Optimizing antipsychotic pharmacotherapy is often challenging due to significant variability in effectiveness and tolerability.
Genetic factors influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may contribute to some of this variability.
Research studies have characterized these pharmacogenetic relationships, and some genetic markers are now available as clinical tests.
These advances in pharmacogenetics research and test availability have great potential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in psychiatric patients.
For clinicians considering using pharmacogenetics, it is important to understand the clinical implications and also the limitations of markers included in currently available tests.
Associations of these variants with clinical efficacy and adverse effects, as well as other clinical implications, in antipsychotic pharmacotherapy are discussed.


Abstract
Health care systems generate a huge volume of different types of data.
Due to the complexity and challenges inherent in studying medical information, it is not yet possible to create a comprehensive model capable of considering all the aspects of health care systems.


Abstract
A common approach is needed to avoid confusion and increase public and stakeholder confidence in the estimates.
The main reason for this difference was that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was not consistently included in the projections.
Given the increasing challenges of dementia in Canada and around the globe, reconciling these differences is critical for developing standards to generate reliable information for public consumption and to shape public policy and service development.


Abstract
Accidents and burns are a major problem in Italy and in industrialized countries, due to the consequences they have on health, especially in children aged 0-4 years.
In Italy, about 400 people die each year from burns, with over 70% of these occurring in the home.
The results of content analysis show that the most frequent mechanism that leads to burns is contact with hot liquids and heating surfaces.
The accidental event descriptions for the younger age group (0-4 years) reveal an unequivocal responsibility of the parents.
The qualitative analysis of narratives was carried out to produce scientific evidence to identify the more frequent and severe burn accidents for specific target/age groups and to establish specific preventive measures.
The study of qualitative analysis of burns observed at the ED was introductory to the pilot project PRIUS (Preventing burns among school-aged children).
The objective of PRIUS is to increase awareness of the risks of burns in children and adults through a learning path tailored towards their prevention, and the promotion of appropriate standards of personal safe behaviour and first aid actions.


Abstract
Burns are a serious public health problem among paediatrics.
Mean length of hospital stay was 10.23 ± 10.60 days.


Abstract
Face burns expose patients to a higher respiratory risk, and early prophylactic intubation before they enter the burn unit might be life-saving.
However, unnecessary intubation may compromise their clinical evolution.
A retrospective study was developed to characterize the experience of the tertiary burn unit of the Hospital da Prelada with face burn patients arriving endotracheally-intubated between January 2009 and September 2013.
Specific goals included assessment of whether these intubations were clinically appropriate and if these procedures determined significant changes in clinical course and outcome.
A total of 136 patients were admitted to our burn centre with facial burns.
38.2% (n=52) of them arrived endotracheally-intubated, with 75% (n=39) intubated at the scene of the burn injury and 25% (n=13) in the emergency room because of the suspicion of smoke inhalation injury.
However, unnecessary intubation may impair clinical evolution.


Abstract
Current surgical and non-surgical eschar removal-debridement techniques are invasive or ineffective.
This review summarizes data from seven studies, four of which were randomized clinical trials that included a SOC or control vehicle.
The total area excised was less in patients treated with DGD compared with the control vehicle (22.9% vs. 73.2%, P<0.001) or the surgical/non-surgical SOC (50.5%, P=0.006).
Less autografting was used in all studies.
Long-term scar quality and function were similar in DGD- and SOCtreated.
DGD is a safe and effective method of burn debridement that offers an alternative to surgical and non-surgical SOC.


Abstract
Education of first responders and referring medical professionals is considered vital to high-quality burn care.
Prior to 1999, the community education program at The Burn Center of MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) was staffed by ICU nurses who volunteered their time.
As the program became more popular in the mid-1990s, the requests for lectures exceeded the capacity of a volunteer program.
A request to hospital administration for a full-time education coordinator position was rejected in the climate of budget cut-backs and declining reimbursement.


Abstract
Over the two-year assessment period, we treated roughly 28,700 burn patients, 1,721 of whom were admitted, with a mortality rate of 5.9%.
The male to female ratio was 1.7:1 (63% male; 37% female).
The mean cost per patient was US$ 2,810 (29,500,000 Rials).


Abstract
This represents an increase of 9% compared to the previous year (268 reports).


Abstract
Osteochondrosis (OC) is common in large-breed dogs.
The aim of this study was to estimate the overall prevalence of humeral head OC in these 2 breeds in Switzerland based on the data of the Swiss National Dysplasia Committees.
All radiographs were re-evaluated to assess single radiographic changes.
From 1993 and 2003, accordingly, until 2013, the overall prevalence was 14% for the GSMD and 8% for the BC, respectively.
Affected joints showed a focally reduced opacity or a flattened/indented contour of the caudal section of the humeral head.
Articular flaps were only seen occasionally.
Degenerative joint disease was significantly more common in OC affected joints (GSMD: 32%; BC: 20%) than in joints without OC.
The present study is the first report on the prevalence of humeral head OC in a large cohort of GSMD and the BC over a long study period.
In comparison to other breeds, the herein reported prevalences are in the mid to upper range.
Results of the present study should alert veterinarians to the disease in these breeds and may serve as a starting point for further epidemiological and genetic studies.


Abstract
As new vaccines against diseases that are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries gradually become available, national health authorities are presented with new regulatory and policy challenges.
The use of CYD-TDV - a chimeric tetravalent, live-attenuated dengue vaccine - was recently approved in five countries.
Although promising for public health, this vaccine has only partial and heterogeneous efficacy and may have substantial adverse effects.
In trials, children who were aged 2-5 years when first given CYD-TDV were seven times more likely to be hospitalized for dengue, in the third year post-vaccination, than their counterparts in the control group.
As it has not been clarified whether this adverse effect is only a function of age or is determined by dengue serostatus, doubts have been cast over the long-term safety of this vaccine in seronegative individuals of any age.
Any deployment of the vaccine, which should be very cautious and only considered after a rigorous evaluation of the vaccine's risk-benefit ratio in explicit national and subnational scenarios, needs to be followed by a long-term assessment of the vaccine's effects.
Furthermore, any implementation of dengue vaccines must not weaken the political and financial support of preventive measures that can simultaneously limit the impacts of dengue and several other mosquito-borne pathogens.


Abstract
Inaccurate documentation of medication histories may lead to medication discrepancies during hospital admissions.
It was unclear whether admission MedRec had improved the process of obtaining warfarin BPMHs and the quality of their documentation.


Abstract
Drinking water at Shatila Palestinian Refugee Camp in Beirut, Lebanon is of poor quality and unpredictably intermittent quantity.
We aimed to characterize drinking water sources and contamination at Shatila and determine how drinking water can be managed to reduce community health burdens.
We interviewed the Popular Committee, well owners, water vendors, water shopkeepers and preschool administrators about drinking water sources, treatment methods and the population served.
Water samples from the sources and intermediaries were analysed for thermotolerant faecal coliforms (FCs), Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia, using immunofluorescent antibody detection for G. lamblia and C. parvum, and chromotrope-2 stain for microsporidia.
All drinking water sources were contaminated with FCs and parasites.
FC counts (cfu/mL) were as follows: wells (35-300), water vendors (2-178), shops (30-300) and preschools (230-300).
Responsible factors identified included: unskilled operators; improper maintenance of wells and equipment; lack of proper water storage and handling; and misperception of water quality.
These factors must be addressed to improve water quality at Shatila and other refugee camps.


Abstract
General health and oral health status in elderly dental patients in Isparta, Turkey.
The majority of the patients (84.4%) had poor oral hygiene according to the Oral Hygiene Index (OHI).
The mean level of the study population's decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index score was 19.1 ± 7.3.
The prevalence of systemic diseases was high (90%).
Women were affected by a significantly higher incidence of systemic diseases than men (96.4% vs. 84.3%; P < 0.001).
The percentage of the elderly taking medication regularly was 72.6%.


Abstract
Role of school teachers in identifying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among primary school children in Mansoura, Egypt.
There is a knowledge gap in primary school teachers that affects their ability to detect attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
This study measured primary school teachers' knowledge about ADHD, and implemented a training programme to improve early detection of ADHD.
The prevalence and risk factors of ADHD were also studied.
The training programme was implemented through a 2-day workshop for 39 primary school teachers who completed a validated Arabic version of the ADHD Rating Scale for 873 primary school children.
The children's parents completed the questionnaire to explore ADHD risk factors.
The teachers' pre-training knowledge scores of ADHD ranged from 17.9 to 46.2%.
Prevalence rate of ADHD was 12.60%.
In conclusion, ADHD is a significant health problem among primary school children in Mansoura, Egypt.
Efforts should be made to improve teachers' knowledge about ADHD and control modifiable risk factors.


Abstract
Validity and reliability of a Persian version of a questionnaire on knowledge of health care providers about sexually transmitted infections.
The aim of this study was to translate into Persian and validate a questionnaire on knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases published by Jaworski and Carey in 2007.
The questionnaire was forward-translated by two bilingual translators, and both translations were discussed by an expert team.
The questionnaire was then back-translated by two other bilingual translators and discussed with both of them.
Two sex-segregated focus group discussions were held with 21 health care providers to evaluate the comprehensibility of the questions.
The final Persian version of the questionnaire was administered to 130 randomly selected health care providers in Rasht in 2014 to assess internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity.
The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.84 for the overall questionnaire, 0.75 for the cause/cure subscale and 0.74 for the general knowledge subscale.
The correlation between an item and its subscale was significantly higher than its correlation with other subscales.
The Persian version of the questionnaire is highly valid and reliable and can be used as a standard instrument for evaluating knowledge about sexually transmitted infections in the Islamic Republic of Iran.


Abstract
Evaluation of serum levels and significance of soluble CD40 ligand in screening patients with hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
The study's objective was to evaluate the clinical significance of sCD40L in HCV- associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCV-HCC) patients.
Sera concentration of circulating sCD40L and IL-10 were assayed using ELISA in 30 HCVpositive patients with HCC, 30 HCV-positive patients with liver cirrhosis and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers with negative anti-HCV-Ab as a control group.
Serum sCD40Lshowed statistically-significant high levels in HCV-HCC patients compared to HCV-cirrhotic patients and normal controls (P < 0.001).
Serum sCD40L had higher diagnostic value in HCC patients compared with serum AFP.
High sensitivity and specificity of sCD40L was observed compared to AFP (90%, 86.7% and 83% and 80% respectively).
Significant positive correlation was detected between serum sCD40L and IL-10(r = 0.85 P < 0.001), AFP (r = 0.62 P < 0.05) and tumour staging (r = 0.5 P < 0.05).
The study concluded that sCD40L is a valuable diagnostic tool in early diagnosis and screening for HCV and HCC as well as routine follow up of HCV cirrhosis patients.
Assessment of serum IL-10 levels in HCV patients may provide a possible predictive marker for disease progression.


Abstract
Associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ADIPOQ, serum adiponectin and increased type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in Bahraini individuals.
This study aimed to estimate the frequency of the SNPs (+45T>G and +276G>T) genotypes and investigate the association between the two SNPs and adiponectin concentration, metabolic parameters and risk of T2DM in the Bahraini population.
We genotyped the two ADIPOQ SNPs in 140 unrelated T2DM patients and 66 nondiabetic controls using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay.
Lipid profile was measured by enzymatic methods.
Total serum adiponectin levels were measured by immunoassay.
T2DM patients had reduced adiponectin levels compared with controls.
+45T>G was more prevalent in patients than controls.
The rare G allele of +45T>G occurred more frequently than the common T allele in T2DM patients compared with controls, and was associated with lower serum adiponectin levels.
There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies of +276G>T between type T2DM patients and controls.
There was no association between both SNPs and metabolic parameters.


Abstract
Benchmarking the health of health sciences students at Kuwait University: towards a culture of health.
Health professional entry-to-practice programmes are intense, competitive and prolonged.
We used a convenience sample of 176 students.
Assessment included a health/wellness questionnaire (smoking, nutrition, physical activity, sleep and stress) and objective measures (resting heart rate, blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio and random blood glucose).
Health status of health sciences students at Kuwait University is not consistent with healthy health professionals in training, who should serve as role models for the public.
A culture of health on campus is recommended to maximize the health of students and their capacity as health role models.


Abstract
Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal (EMHJ): a 20-year overview (1995-2014).
The EMHJ was established in 1995 to provide a peer-reviewed platform for health professionals to share their research with the scientific community.
The objective of this review was to examine EMR public health research trends, as reflected by EMHJ publications in 20 years (1995-2014), through secondary data analysis.
Published articles were categorized according to EMR strategic priority areas (93%), i.e. health systems strengthening (25%); reproductive and child health (22%); communicable diseases (26%); noncommunicable diseases (25%); emergency preparedness (1.5%).
Six countries had each over 100 papers published during the study period, i.e. Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Pakistan.


Abstract
Speakers take into account what information a conversation partner requires in a given context in order to best understand an utterance.
In addition, no studies have examined whether interlocutor engagement differentially impacts these.
Building on a basic present/not-present design, we investigated whether presence of audible speech information and/or an interlocutor affect the movements of the lips and the tongue.
Results show that lip protrusion was greater in mouthed conditions compared to vocalized ones and tongue movements were either attenuated (/wa/) or unaffected (/ri/, /ra/) by these same conditions, indicating differential effects for the visible and non-visible articulators in the absence of an auditory signal.
However, measures of lip protrusion failed to find an effect of social engagement.
We conclude that speakers make use of both auditory and visual modalities in the presence of an interlocutor, and that when acoustic information is unavailable, compensatory increases are made in the visual domain.
Our findings shed new light on the multimodal nature of speech, and pose new questions about differential adaptations made by visible and non-visible articulators in different speech conditions.

Such events have already had substantial impacts on socioeconomic development and population health.
This paper explores how climate change will affect food, human health and water in China.
Such impacts would undoubtedly threaten population health and well-being in many communities.
In the short-term, population health in China is likely to be adversely affected by increases in air temperatures and pollution.
In the medium to long term, however, the indirect impacts of climate change - e.g. changes in the availability of food, shelter and water, decreased mental health and well-being and changes in the distribution and seasonality of infectious diseases - are likely to grow in importance.
The potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change can only be avoided if all countries work together towards a substantial reduction in the emission of so-called greenhouse gases and a substantial increase in the global population's resilience to the risks of climate variability and change.


Abstract
Burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with 195,000 deaths annually.
4016 patients admitted to the Burns Centre, Civil Hospital Karachi from January 2006 to December 2011 were retrospectively analyzed.
To estimate total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults, the rule of nines was used.
SPSS v16.0 software was used for analysis.
Cross tabs were used to assess mortality.
Labourers, housewives and students were the most commonly affected groups.
Burn injuries by flame/fire and electricity were most common.
Most cases were accidental, followed by suicide attempts and homicides.
Mean percentage of TBSA affected was 35.49%.
Mean duration of hospital stay was 16.45 days.
50.6% of the expired cases were females.
The mean age of expired patients was 30.07 while for patients who survived it was 27.01 years.
The outcome of burn injuries is related to various demographic factors.
Female gender, increasing age, burn injuries following suicide attempts and greater surface area involvement predict poor outcome.


Abstract
The article describes typical folkloric- and ethnographic-related burns/scalds in Slovenia.
The preparation work for pig slaughtering ('koline') is dangerous due to the large quantities of boiling water required for the slaughter process and meat production technology.
These types of burns/scalds occur in rural farming areas.
Such injuries are most often ignored and patients, children excepted, do not seek medical help until later, after they have completed their activity.
Due to aggressive thermal agents, these are deep burns that often require specialist surgical care with long-term treatment.
Results are evaluated on the basis of a tenyear statistical and clinical experience.
Incidence of the aforementioned burns is considerably lower today than it was in the past due to national prevention measures and new European legislation on energy and agriculture.
In the future, we expect these distinctive burns/scalds to become a rarity.


Abstract
They are the 8th leading cause of mortality and the 13th most common cause of morbidity in our country.
Male to female ratio was 1,75:1.
514 patients were under 15 years old.
Median age was 25 (range: 3 months - 93 years).
Suicide rates are higher for women than men in our country.


Abstract
Severe burn injuries often require specialized treatment at a burn center.
This study should help elucidate published knowledge regarding transfer time from the scene of the accident to admission to a BICU in Germany.


Abstract
Adequate medical care of severe burn injuries requires special organizational infrastructure and high educational standards, with an appropriate number of health care professionals.


Abstract
All patients survived their burn injuries.

Total scar surface area was grossly evaluated on day 28.


Abstract
Best possible outcome most likely requires extensive surgery.
However, extensive approaches such as microsurgery are generally discouraged in these settings.
We report two successful cases of severe hand contractures reconstructed with free flaps on a surgical mission in Kenya.


Abstract
All the patients were male.
Time from burn injury to patient presentation ranged from 2-8 months.
The flaps and skin grafts were carried out without major complications.
Two flaps developed superficial necrosis at the distal edge.
One case sustained partial skin graft loss due to haematoma.
One case complained of skin hyperpigmentation and hypertrophic scars around the graft.
Secondary debulking procedures were required in two cases.
The entire donor sites were closed by partial thickness skin graft with acceptable appearance, except one case that was closed primarily.
RALT perforator flap is the cornerstone for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects around the knee with acceptable aesthetic and functional results provided that the following items are fulfilled: inclusion of muscle cuff around the pedicle, the pivot point, prevention of pedicle compression after transfer and early surgical intervention on the post-burn knee contracture.

Numerous data sources suggest a decline in child sexual abuse (CSA) in the United States since the early 1990s.


Abstract
Thematic reviews are complemented by regional perspectives from Central Asia, China, Europe, East, Central and West Africa, and Latin America.
The broader issues of pastoral livestock production and its potential for improving and sustaining animal health are of great interest to the OIE.
Summarising the diverse contributions, it appears that pastoral socialecological systems are hotspots of cultural and biological diversity.
They are multifunctional in that they generate diversified sources of income and contribute to sustained natural resource management.
Pastoral populations require favourable institutional and legal frameworks, so governance structures must be improved and reformed through effective participation and the empowerment of pastoralists.
To sustain functional pastoral production systems, the key ingredients are decentralised governance of natural resources, better locally adapted social services, and high flexibility for maintaining mobility.
Young people should be actively encouraged to engage in pastoral livelihoods, which should be supported by improved legal systems for land use by all interested parties.
There is still untapped potential to optimise extensive livestock production through adapted genetic improvement and better transformation, stocking and marketing of animal-source food.
Modern concepts of disease surveillance and response, combining human and animal health as 'One Health', are particularly suited to pastoral systems.
The OIE's interest in pastoralism is highly justified given its economic and environmental importance and its significance for livelihoods.
Sustainable improvements require understanding and discussion of diverse social and ecological interactions, and it is to this discussion which the authors and editors of this issue of the Review have endeavoured to contribute.


Abstract
All of this takes place while pastoralists try to maintain their mobile lifestyle within a rapidly changing ecosystem.
The pastoralist way of life could be described as being linked to both their livestock and their environment, which makes social science an important element when researching the delivery and adaptation of social services to pastoralists.
Early or pre-diagnostic detection of emerging and endemic infectious disease remains a vital aspect of health surveillance targeted at preventing further transmission and spread.
Community-based syndromic surveillance, coupled with visual mobile phone technology, adapted to the high levels of illiteracy among nomads, could offer an alternative to existing health surveillance systems.
Although considerable efforts have been made towards integrating mobile pastoralists into social services, obstacles remain to the adoption of a clear, specific and sustainable policy on pastoralism in sub-Saharan Africa.


Abstract
However, pastoralists are often excluded from studies, surveillance systems and health programmes.
The occurrence of preventable and treatable diseases such as perinatal tetanus, measles and tuberculosis are indicative of limited access to health providers and information.
It is difficult for health services to include effective outreach with their available financial and human resources.
One consequence is that maternal mortality rates among pastoralists are unacceptably high.
Environmental determinants such as the quality of water and the pasture ecosystems further influence the morbidity of pastoralists.
In the Sahel, the nutritional status of pastoralist children is seasonally better than that of settled children; but pastoralist women tend to have higher acute malnutrition rates.
Pastoralist women are more vulnerable than men to exclusion from health services for different context-specific reasons.
Evidence-based control measures can be assessed in cluster surveys with simultaneous assessments of health among people and livestock, where data on costs of disease and interventions are also collected.
These provide important arguments for governmental and non-governmental agencies for intervention development.


Abstract
This paper analyses the triangle of mobility, communication, and insecurity in order to understand the present-day situation of the nomadic and semi-nomadic Fulani pastoralists and their identity dynamics.
The Fulani find themselves caught in between these conflicts, which end their mobility and often lead to the loss of their herds.
Will they be able to keep their mobile lifestyle and identity?
This article is based on qualitative case studies and the biographical narratives of nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralists who have lived through conflict and violence in Cameroon, Chad and Mali.


Abstract
Communication is vital for the socio-economic and cultural development of pastoralists.
If used constructively, communication can help to create a favourable environment for change and modernisation.
This paper tries to uncover trends in communication as part of pastoral development, emphasising both indigenous and current methods of communication and prevailing constraints.
Pastoralists have their own well-established communications systems for sharing information on climatic conditions and ecology, as well as economic, social and political issues.
Modern communication technologies, especially radio and mobile telephones, are increasingly being used by pastoralists to access current regional information.
The authors therefore call for the adoption of more participatory and integrated approaches towards communication, the expansion of infrastructure and building of capacity.


Abstract
Experiences of mobile pastoralists often attest to a wide range of contradictions about the presumed advantages of formal education.


Abstract
Pastoralism is a system of dynamically managing livestock and land for economic, social and environmental benefit.
To a large extent, pastoralism is an adaptation to ecological and climatic variability and is not simply a livestock production system but provides significant environmental services to humanity.
As long as pastoralists remain marginalised, with weak rights and little access to services, their future will remain uncertain.


Abstract
Pastoralists have a rich tradition of 'innovation', as continuous adaptation to new ecological and economic scenarios has been a prerequisite for their survival through the millennia.
One of their greatest assets is the large number of locally adapted livestock breeds they have developed, which represent a major resource for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation.
Pastoralists are beginning to position themselves as providers of ecological services as well as of livestock products that represent a healthy and eco-friendly alternative to the products from industrial production systems.
Nevertheless, many governments continue with antagonistic policies, being unaware of the ecological and economic significance of their pastoral populations.
There is a need for increased recognition of the inherent 'modernity' of pastoralism and the role it can play in creating a more green economy.


Abstract
Raw materials are preserved by heating, drying, smoking, pickling, salting, curing or fermentation with microorganisms.
This article describes preservation techniques in the pastoral context, targeting the major dietary components of milk, meat and cereals; related health risks; and potential innovations for food preservation.
However, modern preservation procedures are difficult to adapt to the lifestyles of pastoralists and so are rarely implemented or accepted.
Drying and spontaneous fermentation are key preservation techniques among pastoralists that serve as opportunities for innovation and can be shared across pastoral communities.
Further potential for innovation lies in the unique, largely uncharacterised, microflora biodiversity of fermented products.


Abstract
Social protection programmes are designed to help vulnerable populations - including pastoralists - maintain a basic level of well-being, manage risk, and cope with negative shocks.
Theory suggests that differential targeting according to poverty status can increase the reach and effectiveness of budgeted social protection programmes.
Vulnerable non-destitute households benefit from protection against costly temporary shocks, but do not necessarily need regular assistance.
Welfare gains occur when a comprehensive social protection programme considers the needs of both types of households.
Both types of social protection scheme have been shown to decrease poverty, improve food security and protect child health.
However, the behavioural response for asset accumulation varies with the type of protection and the household's unique situation.
Poor households that receive cash transfers retain and accumulate assets quickly.
Insured households, who are typically vulnerable yet not destitute, protect existing herds and invest more in the livestock they already own.


Abstract
While pastoralist systems contribute substantially to national economies, government investment to support pastoralism remains limited or non-existent.
In this paper, the authors show that investment and technology can support and empower pastoralist marketing strategies in supplying higher-value and more stable livestock products.
Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that pastoralists also supply services, broadening the marketing landscape within which they operate to include more players and trading options.
Pastoralists are undeniably the custodians of rangelands and provide a wide range of ecosystem services.
These new market prospects nevertheless require structuring (e.g. regulation, infrastructure) and adjustments in the trading environment of stakeholders all along the value chain.
There is, however, an inherent risk in intervening in pastoral marketing and production processes.
Too many or ill-adapted interventions can have severe effects on these systems, resulting in over-intensification and reduced mobility.
Finding the right level of intervention to support extensive pastoral systems is important when developing policy, since it is about the only form of land use that can keep a third of the world's land surface in food production without additional inputs.


Abstract
Transhumant pastoralism remains a prevalent form of land use across Europe, especially in mountain areas.
These threaten its future.
The decline of transhumant systems leads to ecological, economic, and socio-cultural losses, e.g. the loss of biodiversity, of shared cultural heritage based on pastoral practices, and of common property institutions.


Abstract
Most grasslands exhibit some degree of degradation.
The percentage of offspring reaching weaning age is low: 47-66% of calves and 40-80% of lambs.
Some pastoralists adopt patterns of transhumance.
In the main, pastoralists experience a high poverty rate and have poor access to social services.
For many pastoralists, wildlife is a source of food and by-products.
Pastoral systems subsist mainly on income unrelated to pastoral farming.
The OIE recognises all four countries as free from infection with peste des petits ruminants virus, and from rinderpest and African horse sickness.
It is difficult to predict the future of pastoralism in Latin America because the situation differs from country to country.
For instance, pastoralism is more important in Peru than in Argentina, where it is a more marginal activity.
In the future, lack of promotion and protection policies could lead to a decline in pastoralism or to an adverse environmental impact on drylands.


Abstract
Pastoralists in Africa are increasingly vulnerable to the effects of globalisation, climate change and changes in land use.
They are confronted with problems related to access to scarce natural resources and their regulation, the management of mobility, and too little investment in health systems, livestock production and social service delivery.
However, this paper focuses on positive trends and vital innovations in pastoral societies.
These rely on robust institutions and policy frameworks that contribute to economically secure, politically stable, and environmentally sustainable livelihoods for African pastoral societies.
The authors analyse ways in which internal and external efforts can improve the economic viability and social aspects of pastoralism.
The institutions that manage natural resources and their effects on livelihoods and access to social services must be critically reviewed.
The authors suggest that a new model for the economic and social development of African pastoralism should be positioned between donor- or governmentdriven development (in other words, 'seeing like a state') and the autonomous development goals of pastoralists ('seeing like a pastoralist').
Pastoralists are resourceful, entrepreneurial and innovative people, fully able to support new institutional systems and services which recognise their way of life and production systems.


Abstract
Those who rely directly on pastureland for their livelihood are vulnerable to the joint effects of pastureland degradation and climate change.


Abstract
Pastoralists are among the most politically and economically marginalised communities in the world.
They have less and less access to the natural resources on which their livelihoods depend and very limited access to basic socio-economic services and infrastructure.
Among the main drivers of pastoralist marginalisation are poor public and private institutional arrangements.
The consequences are violent conflict and increased mobility and relocation.
Responses to the current weaknesses of pastoralism must encompass inclusive, comprehensive institutions which allow access to resources, economic viability and integration in the new socio-ecological space.


Abstract
Unless these barriers are identified, unpacked and managed, even increasing the rigour and intensity of data collection will not deliver a realistic representation of pastoral systems in statistics and policymaking.


Abstract
The relationship between pastoralists, their livestock, wildlife and the rangelands of East Africa is multi-directional, complex and long-standing.
In conservation terminology these areas are called buffer zones.
Finally, they consider some of the sustainable and equitable practices that could be implemented to improve livelihoods and benefit wildlife and pastoralism alike.

The author explains how terms such as 'carrying capacity', 'overgrazing' and 'desertification' are often taken out of their social and political context when describing rangeland pastoralism.
Next, he describes the growing recognition by the development community of the importance of the mobility model, particularly in relation to changing ecologies and politics.


Abstract
Pastoral systems are important producers and repositories of livestock diversity.
Pastoralists' breeding concepts and selection strategies seem to be geared towards improving their animals' capability to exploit variability, by - among other things - enhancing within-breed diversity.
In-depth studies of these concepts and strategies could contribute considerably towards developing methodological innovations for the characterisation and evaluation of pastoral livestock resources.


Abstract
However, pastoralists were actually encouraged to settle and adopt such strategies, copied from rangelands with higher and more reliable rainfall.
This curtailed mobility resulted in a shift from opportunistic and extensive land use to more intensive and settled forms of use.
The purpose of this review is to examine the link between pastoralism and the provision of ecosystem services by rangelands, focusing on biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration.
Pastoralists employ several techniques to manage rangeland resources, including mobility, herding, corralling, grazing reserves and the use of fire.
With these strategies, pastoralists have contributed to the enhancement of rangeland biodiversity and the long-term conservation of important wildlife habitats.
Pastoralists also possess detailed knowledge of rangeland plants and their uses, which could be valuable in the assessment, conservation and utilisation of rangeland biodiversity.
Similarly, traditional pastoral rangeland management practices, such as the use of seasonal grassland reserves and livestock mobility, influence vegetation composition, coverage and abundance in rangelands and offer tools for biomass and soil carbon restoration, contributing to the mitigation of climate change.
Rather than abandoning pastoralism, the revitalisation of traditional practices and indigenous knowledge is vital to secure sustainable livelihoods for millions of pastoralists and to maintain rangeland biodiversity and ecosystem services.


Abstract
In higher latitudes, the removal of temperature constraints might increase pasture production and livestock productivity, but in tropical arid lands, the impacts are highly location specific, but mostly negative.
Due to the dynamism of all the changes affecting pastoral societies, strategies that lock pastoral societies into specified development pathways could be maladaptive.
Flexible and evolving combinations of practices and policies are the key to successful pastoral adaptation.


Abstract
Since colonial times, these have been based on a persistent misconception of the nature of pastoral economies and combined with increasing land alienation and fragmentation through government policies and covert privatisation of pastures.
The paper focuses especially on pastoral populations in African drylands and is based on long-term research by independent researchers summarising some of their experiences in western, eastern and southern Africa.
Most of them are organised in the African Drylands Dialogue, trying to shed some light on the developments in these areas.
Before discussing the actual situation of African pastoralists, the authors focus on basic institutional features of the political and economic management of common grazing lands.
This is followed by an overview of land alienation processes in colonial times, which serves as a basis for understanding the current land alienation constellations.
The paper then moves on to explain how and why pastoralists are framed by the national discourses as the 'other' and the 'troublemaker', even being labelled as terrorists in nation state contexts.
This goes hand in hand with a new wave of land alienation in the form of large-scale land acquisitions or 'land grabbing' (including water grabbing and 'green grabbing' processes).
Finally, the paper discusses the way in which pastoralism could be reframed in a participatory way in the future.


Abstract
The paper also examines long-term trends in pastoralist areas which, at first sight, appear to be contradictory.
This trend indicates robust and responsive livestock production and marketing in pastoralist areas, despite recurrent drought, conflict and weak governance.
In contrast, the second trend sees increasing levels of poverty and destitution in pastoralist areas, and continued high levels of human malnutrition.
The co-existence of economic growth and increasing poverty in 'high-export' areas is explained by human population growth, drought, and the private control of pastures and water by wealthier producers.
All of these factors combine to push poorer producers out of pastoralism.
In areas with lower market orientation, other forms of declining land access are often evident, including the appropriation of land for mechanised farming, hydroelectric schemes, and bush encroachment.
These changes, plus population growth and drought, also push people out of pastoralism.
In all areas, pastoralism will continue to be the main economic activity but, at the same time, increasing numbers of people are seeking other livelihoods.


Abstract
An increase in both human population and economic growth has been accompanied by rising per capita demand for animal products.
Other beneficial aspects of sustainable intensification and sustainable pastoralism should also be taken into account.
This paper proposes a conceptual framework to transform the livestock sector, using principles of sustainable consumption and production, environmental stewardship, inclusive prosperity, and healthy lifestyles.
It also highlights several areas where additional research and modelling are required.


Abstract
Over the past few decades, the heritage designation process has come to impact on the way of life of many nomadic pastoralists across the world.
Heritage policies were further extended by the establishment of the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage (the Convention was adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in October 2003 and came into force in 2006) and the list of Cultural Landscapes (adoption in 1992, with the first site listed in 1993).
In this context of wholesale heritage designation, it is interesting to examine how local knowledge - especially that on hardy animal breeds - is promoted and safeguarded.
The authors focus on the case of Morocco, where the national association of sheep and goat breeders (ANOC) oversees breed selection and health policy for local breeds, in order to demonstrate that greater recognition of farmers' knowledge and their ability to identify hardy animals can ensure the sustainability of farms in both South and North from a socio-economic, genetic and health standpoint.


Abstract
Pastoralism is a complex system, driven by interacting ecological, social and economic factors that cannot be adequately addressed by one discipline or sector alone.
For its future development, we must engage with local knowledge systems and with all stakeholders.


Abstract
Animal diseases and zoonoses abound among pastoralist livestock, which is composed of cattle, sheep, goats, yak, camels, llamas, reindeer, horses and donkeys.
There is endemic and, periodically, epidemic transmission of highly contagious viral and bacterial diseases in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Pastoralist livestock is often multiparasitised with endo- and ectoparasites, as well as being affected by vectorborne viral and protozoal diseases.
Public and private animal health services currently underperform in almost all pastoral areas due to structural reforms and lack of income, as indicated in assessments of national Veterinary Services by the World Organisation for Animal Health.
Control of infectious disease in industrialised countries has been achieved through large-scale public funding of control measures and compensation for culled stock.
Such means are not available in pastoralist areas of most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
While the cost-effectiveness and profitability of the control of animal diseases and zoonoses is less of a consideration for industrialised countries, in the experience of the authors, understanding the economic implications of a control programme is a prerequisite for successful attempts to improve animal health in LMICs.
The incremental costs of animal disease control can potentially be shared using crosssector assessments, integrated control, and regional coordination efforts to mitigate transboundary disease risks.
In this paper, the authors discuss cost-effective animal disease and zoonoses control in LMICs.
It illustrates frameworks and examples of integrated control and cross-sector economics, showing conditions under which these diseases could be controlled in a cost-effective way.


Abstract
Resistances to antimicrobials pose serious public health challenges.
This issue concerns both human and veterinary medicine and can only be solved by a multidisciplinary approach.
In this context, the AntibioticScout (www.AntibioticScout. ch) offers a new online tool for the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine.
A first version of the AntibioticScout for the treatment of dogs, cats and horses is available by the end of 2016.


Abstract
We showed that SGSL was able to substitute VD3 in broilers as far as the performance parameters were concerned.
This is 20 times higher than the upper limit of the commercially recommended dose.
We concluded that SGSL is a safe feed additive to use in broiler chicken.


Abstract
Validation of Persian version of WHOQOL-HIV BREF questionnaire in Islamic Republic of Iran.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to validate the first Persian version of the WHOQOL-HIV BREF questionnaire.
The study sample comprised 61 patients regularly attending the outpatient infectious disease clinic consultation centre for patients with behavioural disorders in 2013-2014.
The internal consistency, content related validity and reliability of WHOQOL-HIV BREF were evaluated.
Content validity was quantified using the content validity ratio (CVR) according the to Lawshe formula.
CVR > 0.51 and mean judgment > 2 were significant at P = 0.05.
The Cronbach alpha score was > 0.7 for each domain and = 0.87 for the whole scale, indicating good reliability.
Item-to-total correlation coefficient between each item and its respective domain was 0.39-0.87.
The correlation between each domain and overall QOL was excellent.
This study demonstrates that the Persian version of WHOQOL-HIV BREF is a valid and reliable tool for evaluation of QOL in HIV-infected patients.


Abstract
Effect of anti-smoking advertisements on Turkish adolescents.
The aim of the present study was to determine the perception of 10 anti-smoking advertisements in 1434 Turkish adolescents.
We used the Effectiveness of the Anti-smoking Advertisements Scale, which included 6 items for each advertisement; each item was assessed on a 5-point Likert-type scale.
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the impact of the advertisements.
All the advertisements were more effective for adolescents who had never smoked compared to ex-smokers and current smokers.
We also noted that, regardless of age, smoking status decreased the effectiveness of all the advertisements.
Previous studies have shown that smokers have a negative attitude towards anti-smoking messages.
In the present study, the most effective advertisements among adolescents were those with "Sponge and tar", "Smoking harms in every breath" and "Children want to grow".
In conclusion, although anti-smoking campaigns are targeted towards adults, they also have a strong influence on adolescents.
The main target population for advertisements should be individuals aged < 15 years who have not yet started smoking.


Abstract
The impact of media and advertising of food on the eating behaviour of adolescent girls in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
This study aims to detect differences in eating behaviours demonstrated by adolescent girls in Jeddah Saudi Arabia, according to the influence of the media through TV advertisements.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 1519 girls from 20 schools in Jeddah.
Survey questions included information regarding media advertising and its effect on eating behaviour.
Bivariate analyses were performed to define differences in eating behaviour according to media influence and Chi-square analyses to detect significant relationships.
The results indicated a significant correlation between dessert consumption and advertising exposure (P = 0.035).
Adolescent girls exposed to such advertising were more likely to consume dessert [n=299 (48.5%)], to shop for food [n=316 (50.7%)], and had attempted to lose weight [n=373 (59.5%)].
The results emphasize the role and obligation of decision-makers to protect young consumers through increased legislation and control of media content (particularly food advertisements) targeting young people.


Abstract
Prevalence and correlates of metabolic syndrome in pre-crisis Syria: call for current relief efforts.
This study aimed to assess the prevalence, components and correlates of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adults in pre-crisis Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic.
We used a population-based, 2-stage cluster sampling method in a population of 557 men and 611 women, randomly selected from 83 residential neighbourhoods including many rural settlers.
Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, comorbidity, anthropometry and biochemical indices were measured.
Prevalence of MetS was estimated at 39.6%, with comparable rates in men and women.
Hypertension was the most prevalent component (56.6%), followed by central obesity (51.4%).
Among women, education (12 years) was inversely associated with risk of MetS, while family history of obesity and diabetes was associated with an increased risk.
The high prevalence of MetS and its components emphasizes the burden of cardiovascular diseases among adults in pre-crisis Aleppo.
A system of surveillance and management for cardiovascular diseases needs to be incorporated into the current humanitarian response.


Abstract
Trends in outpatient cataract surgery in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2006-2010.
This study aimed to determine the trends in outpatient cataract surgery and its determinants in the Islamic Republic of Iran between 2006 and 2010.
In this cross-sectional study, 106 cataract surgery centres were selected in all provinces by multistage randomized cluster sampling.
The number of centres in each province was determined from the number of cataract operations and the number of patient charts examined in each centre was proportionate to the number of cataract operations in that centre.
The prevalence of outpatient surgery increased from 46.0% (95% CI, 35.3-56.8) in 2006 to 51.4% (95% CI, 40.2-62.7) in 2010 (P = 0.549).
Patients stayed in hospital for more than one night after 10.5% (95% CI, 6.9-14.1) of operations.
Use of phacoemulsification and topical anaesthesia increased the prevalence of outpatient surgery and decreased intraoperative complications.
Although outpatient cataract surgery increased by 11.7%, use of methods such as phacoemulsification is not widespread, and more attention should be paid to the barriers to outpatient cataract surgery in the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Abstract
Association between body mass index, diet and dental caries in Grade 6 boys in Medina, Saudi Arabia.
The prevalence of obesity is increasing in Saudi Arabia and although caries is associated with obesity, this association has not been investigated in Medina.
This study aimed to determine the association between dental caries, body mass index (BMI) and dietary habits of 12-year-old boys from four geographically distinct schools in Medina.
Mean BMI was 22.17 kg/m² (± 5.15); 41% had normal BMI, 25% were overweight and 30% were obese.
The mean Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT) score was 1.46 (± 2.04).
Those in the normal BMI range had a significantly higher prevalence of caries (57%) and DMFT score (1.92) compared with the overweight and obese groups (P < 0.05).
These differences remained significant after controlling for possible confounders via linear regression.
Mean BMI was significantly lower in boys with severe compared with mild or no caries.
Normal and underweight participants had an almost 2 times greater risk of developing caries compared with their overweight and obese counterparts.
The children had poor dietary habits and there were no significant associations between dietary variables and caries.


Abstract
Primary oral health care: a missing link in public health in Pakistan.
In Pakistan, the limited availability of oral health care and the high level of unmet oral health care needs are well documented.
The recorded prevalence of dental caries is 50-70% and that of oral cancer is among the highest in the world.
Oral cancer screening and atraumatic restorative treatment for tooth decay could be included in a basic package of oral care that does not require qualified dental surgeons.
This article develops an argument, based on literature review and an analysis of the health system in Pakistan, for how a basic oral health programme could be an accessible, affordable and acceptable component of the primary health care system.

The desire for more sophisticated diagnostic and predictive tools has led to increased use of sperm DNA damage in the management of male infertility.
Despite the availability of numerous assays to measure sperm DNA damage, our understanding of the etiology, measurement, and clinical implications of sperm DNA damage remains incomplete.


Abstract
Childhood obesity is an important public health problem that affects countries in the Americas.
The interventions laid out in this regional plan are multi-faceted and require multi-sectoral partnerships.
Building on a strong history of successful trilateral collaboration, Canada, Mexico, and the United States formed a partnership to address the growing epidemic of childhood obesity in the North American region.
This collaborative effort, known as the Trilateral Cooperation on Childhood Obesity Initiative, is the first initiative in the region to address chronic noncommunicable diseases by bringing together technical and policy experts, with strong leadership and support from the secretaries and ministers of health.
The Initiative's goals include increasing levels of physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior through 1) increased social mobilization and citizen engagement, 2) community- based outreach, and 3) changes to the built (man-made) environment.
This article describes the background and development process of the Initiative; specific goals, activities, and actions achieved to date; and opportunities and next steps.
This information may be useful for those forming other partnerships designed to address childhood obesity or other complex public health challenges in the region.


Abstract
Cost-effectiveness analysis is used to compare the costs and outcomes of alternative policy options.
Each resulting cost-effectiveness ratio represents the magnitude of additional health gained per additional unit of resources spent.
Cost-effectiveness thresholds allow cost-effectiveness ratios that represent good or very good value for money to be identified.
In 2001, the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics in Health suggested cost-effectiveness thresholds based on multiples of a country's per-capita gross domestic product (GDP).
In some contexts, in choosing which health interventions to fund and which not to fund, these thresholds have been used as decision rules.


Abstract
Experimental and spectral data are reported for all new compounds.
All synthesized C-1 homologues of pancratistatin and 7-deoxypancratistatin were evaluated for antiproliferative activity in a panel of human cancer cell lines.
As expected, the 7-hydroxy compounds were found to be more potent and the activity of the C-1 benzoxymethyl analogue exceeded that of narciclasine, which was used as a positive control.

Abstract
Economically and politically disruptive disease outbreaks are a hallmark of the 21st century.
Standardized integrated biological-behavioural surveillance could, and should, be used in community settings to complement such clinical monitoring.
The usefulness of such an approach has already been demonstrated in studies on human immunodeficiency virus, where integrated surveillance contributed to a biologically based and quantifiable understanding of the behavioural risk factors associated with the transmission dynamics of the virus.
When designed according to Strengthening the Reporting of
Observation
al Studies in Epidemiology criteria, integrated surveillance requires that both behavioural risk factors - i.e. exposure variables - and disease-indicator outcome variables be measured in behavioural surveys.
In the field of pandemic threats, biological outcome data could address the weaknesses of self-reported data collected in behavioural surveys.
Data from serosurveys of viruses with pandemic potential, collected under non-outbreak conditions, indicate that serosurveillance could be used to predict future outbreaks.
When conducted together, behavioural surveys and serosurveys could warn of future pandemics, potentially before the disease appears in clinical settings.
Traditional disease-outcome surveillance must be frequent and ongoing to remain useful but behavioural surveillance remains informative even if conducted much less often, since behaviour change occurs slowly over time.
Only through knowledge of specific behavioural risk factors can interventions and policies that can prevent the next pandemic be developed.

Abstract
We present a case of AWS in a male squash player with no history of breast cancer or surgery following a period of intense exercise.
This case highlights the rare presentation of AWS in a male patient and raises awareness for the health care practitioner who may not suspect this condition in this population.


Abstract
Septic bursitis (SB) is an important differential diagnosis in athletes presenting with an acute subcutaneous swelling of the elbow or knee.
Prompt recognition is essential to minimize recovery time and prevent the spread of infection.
Due to the significant overlap in clinical features, it is often difficult to differentiate SB from non-septic bursitis (NSB) without bursal aspirate analysis.
SB is commonly not considered unless the bursitis is accompanied by a local skin lesion or fever.
This study describes two cases of septic olecranon bursitis and one case of septic prepatellar bursitis in adult hockey players presenting to a sports medicine clinic.
None of the cases presented with an observable skin lesion and only one case developed a fever.
It is therefore essential that clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion and monitor for signs of progression when presented with an acute bursitis even in the absence of these features.


Abstract
Return-to-play (RTP) is a multifactorial process of retuning an injured athlete back to competition when risk for re-injury is minimized.
Traditionally, these decisions are made by medical practitioners based on experience or anecdotal evidence.
RTP decisions continue to be a challenging task for the medical practitioner.


Abstract
Poomsae is the only non-contact and no opponent form of Taekwondo.
The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine the type and rate of injuries in elite Canadian Poomsae athletes.
Strain and joint dysfunction were the most common types of injuries in Poomsae.
Lower limb and back were the most common area of injury in females and males respectively.
Athletes ≤40 years of age were more prone to acute injuries compared to athletes over 40.
As result of reflection on this study a Poomsae Injury Report Form was developed.


Abstract
In 1978 the Canadian Chiropractic Association recognized the need to establish an organization that would prepare chiropractors to treat athletic injuries and promote these services to sports organizations.
Dr. Adrian Grice approached three chiropractors to establish such an organization.
The Canadian Chiropractic Sports Academy (CCSA) was established in 1978.


Abstract
Since the 1970s, international research on male contraception has been actively pursued.
Hormonal and non-hormonal methods (thermal, chemical) have been tested, leading to clinical trials of interest to thousands of men and couples.
The results showed that it was possible to develop methods of male contraception that inhibited spermatogenesis with good contraceptive efficacy.
However, their side effects (mainly loss of libido), poorly accepted modes of administration, and the high frequency of poor responders prevented their widespread use.
Based on earlier initiatives, new avenues were explored and significant progress was achieved, allowing the reasoned use of male contraception.
For 40 years, several French teams have played an important role in this research.
These approaches have led to a better comprehension of spermatogenesis that could be useful in fields other than male contraception: effects of toxic compounds, fertility preservation.


Abstract
In 2007, Health Promotion Ontario (HPO) began working to advance the "profession" of health promotion (HP) in Canada through development of national competencies for health promoters.
Their work was continued by the Pan-Canadian Network for Health Promoter Competencies ("the Network").
The current health promoter competencies were released in November 2015, following a series of literature reviews and practitioner consultations.

Abstract
Iranian public trust in health services: evidence from Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study investigated public trust in health services in Tabriz, Islamic Republic of Iran.
A crosssectional household study was conducted in 2014, using random cluster sampling.
A total of 1050 households were enrolled in the study and a valid questionnaire was used to collect data through interviews.
The mean score for public trust in health services in Tabriz (out of 100) was 53.91 ± 13.7.
Specialists, pharmacy doctors and nurses were the health providers that enjoyed the highest levels of trust.
It is concluded that public trust in health services in Tabriz is low and policy-makers need to employ appropriate policies to improve patients' experience of health services.


Abstract
Tobacco chewing and risk of gastric cancer: a case-control study in Yemen.
This study aimed to assess the risk factors for gastric cancer in Yemen.
A hospital-based case-control study of 70 cases and 140 controls was carried out in Sana'a city between May and October 2014.
A structured questionnaire was used to collect information through direct interview.
Living in rural areas, tobacco chewing and drinking untreated water were significant risk factors for gastric cancer.
Frequent consumption of chicken, cheese, milk, starchy vegetables, cucumber, carrots, leeks, sweet pepper, fruit drinks, legumes and olive oil were associated significantly with decreased risk of gastric cancer.
Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that chewing tobacco and frequent consumption of white bread were associated with increased risk of gastric cancer, whereas frequent consumption of chicken, cooked potatoes and fruit drinks had an inverse association.
Risk of gastric cancer can be prevented by health education and increasing community awareness.

In radiation environments, improving staff attitudes toward their safety may be considered as a key strategy to increase job satisfaction.


Abstract
Turkish version of the SPAN questionnaire for highschool students: reproducibility and validity.
This study aimed to generate a Turkish version of the School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) (2009) questionnaire for high-school students and to test its validity and reproducibility.
The questionnaire was translated and back translated and the language validity was assessed.
It was tested and re-tested on 318 highschool students to evaluate its validity and reproducibility.
Validity was determined by comparing the parts of the questionnaire about what was eaten in the previous day with that of 24-hour food consumption lists.
Statistical analysis was performed by using Spearman correlation analysis, kappa statistics and percentage of agreement.
The highest test-re-test results were on foods consumed the day before, with an agreement percentage range of 56%-96% and a kappa range of 0.43-0.95.
The items related to physical activity had an agreement range of 38%-88% and a kappa range of 0.24-0.82.
The reproducibility and validity of the Turkish version of SPAN questionnaire is acceptable and it is a rapid, easily used tool for the assessment of nutrition and physical activity in schoolchildren.


Abstract
Knowledge of diabetes among patients in the United Arab Emirates and trends since 2001: a study using the Michigan Diabetes Knowledge Test.
Knowledge of diabetes among patients with the disease in the United Arab Emirates is essential for effective self-management.
We assessed the level of diabetes-related knowledge among patients and compared it with that found in previous studies in the same city.
A cross-sectional study, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire, was conducted at two clinics in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates.
The Michigan Diabetes Knowledge Test, translated into Arabic, was used to assess knowledge of diabetes.
Of 165 participants with diabetes, 130 (78.8%) were women.
The mean knowledge score was low at 55% (6.6 out of a maximum possible score of 12, standard deviation 1.8).
This is comparable to levels found in previous studies: 55.5% in 2001 and 68.2% in 2006.
Misconceptions about the diabetic diet and blood testing were common.
The level of diabetes-related knowledge has remained low since 2001.
These results are of concern in view of the substantial investments made in diabetes care and health education in the region.


Abstract
Preliminary estimates of the economic implications of addiction in the United Arab Emirates.
This study aimed to provide preliminary estimates of the economic implications of addiction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Local and international data sources were used to derive estimates of substancerelated healthcare costs, lost productivity and criminal behaviour.
From an estimated population of 8.26 million: ~1.47 million used tobacco (20.5% of adults); 380 085 used cannabis (> 5%); 14 077 used alcohol in a harmful manner (0.2%); and 1408 used opiates (0.02%).
The cost of addiction was estimated at US$ 5.47 billion in 2012, equivalent to 1.4% of gross domestic product.
Productivity costs were the largest contributor at US$ 4.79 billion (88%) followed by criminal behaviour at US$ 0.65 billion (12%).
There were no data to estimate cost of: treating tobacco-related diseases, community education and prevention efforts, or social disharmony.
Current data collection efforts are limited in their capacity to fully inform an appropriate response to addiction in the UAE.
Resources are required to improve indicators of drug use, monitor harm and evaluate treatment.


Abstract
Prevalence and seasonal variation of human intestinal parasites in patients attending hospital with abdominal symptoms in northern Jordan.
This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and their seasonal variation in northern Jordan.
A total of 21 906 stool samples were collected over a period of 4 years (2009- 2013) from 5 government hospitals in 3 cities.
Samples were processed and examined microscopically and by concentration methods.
Parasitic infection was found in 9611 samples (44%).
The prevalence of different parasites varied according to season, on average the summer months showed the highest incidence of parasitic infection (62%) compared with the winter months (16%).
Giardia lamblia and Ent. histolytica were most prevalent in the summer months.


Abstract
Dietary transition and obesity in selected Arabicspeaking countries: a review of the current evidence.
Escalating obesity rates have become a significant public health problem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and have been associated with shifts towards a westernized diet.
This integrative review aimed to examine the current dietary trends and transitions and their association with obesity in Arabic-speaking countries of the MENA region.
Relevant databases were searched for studies in MENA countries between 1998 and 2014 that investigated obesity trends and changes in dietary patterns at the regional level in all age groups.
A total of 39 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria.


Abstract
Fungal infection is a leading cause of death in burns patients and incurs significant costs for burn units.
Our aim was to determine epidemiology of these infections, and analyze risk factors in the burns intensive care unit of the National Center for Burns and Plastic Surgery at Ibn-Rochd University Hospital, Casablanca.
It is a retrospective review of all patients admitted from 2011-2014 who developed cultures positive for fungal organisms.
Criteria for nosocomial fungal infections were those of the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta (1988, revised 1992, 2004).
Microbiological surveillance was carried out daily.
Mean age of patients was 24.5 +/- 27.3 years; 63% were female.
Mean % TBSA was 30.7 +/- 23.4%, and % FTSA was 21.7 +/- 20.1%.
Incidence of nosocomial fungal infection was 10%.
Amphotericin B and fluconazole were the most frequently used antifungal agents.


Abstract
Burns caused by exhaust systems in children may be associated with considerable morbidity.
Current epidemiological data varies, but no data are available for the UK population.
Data collected included patient demographics, burn injury information, management and outcomes.
77% of the patients were male.
Thirty-three percent of patients required operative intervention.
Time to heal was less than 3 weeks in 69% of cases and 3 patients healed with hypertrophic scarring.
We recommend the wearing of protective long trousers when riding motorcycles and the fitting of external shields to motorcycle exhaust pipes.


Abstract
A retrospective, single-centre trial at the burn unit of the Prelada Hospital was conducted, including patients admitted between January 2011 and December 2014.


Abstract
There is a paucity of evidence regarding incidence and causes of hypothermia in patients with major burns and its impact on outcomes.
This paper identifies contributing factors to hypothermia and its relationship with the severity of physiological scoring systems on admission to a tertiary centre.
Patients with burns >20% TBSA admitted between March 2010 and July 2013 comprised this retrospective survey.
There was no difference between groups in terms of mortality in hospital (p=0.151) or length of hospital stay (p=0.547).


Abstract
Burn scars remain a serious physical and psychological problem for the affected.
Clinical studies as well as basic scientific research have shown that Medical Needling can significantly increase the quality of burn scars with comparatively low risk and stress for the patient with regards to skin elasticity, moisture, erythema and transepidermal water loss.
However, Medical Needling has no influence on repigmentation of large hypopigmented scars.
The goal is to evaluate whether both established methods - Needling (improvement of scar quality) and ReNovaCell (repigmentation) - can be combined.
So far, eight patients with mean age of 20 years (6-28 years) with deep second and third degree burn scars have been treated.
The average treated tissue surface was 76cm² (15-250cm²) and was focused on areas like face, neck, chest and arm.
Medical Needling is performed using a roller covered with 3mm long needles.
The roller is vertically, horizontally and diagonally rolled over the scar, inducing microtrauma.
Then, non-cultured autologous skin cell suspension (ReNovaCell) is applied, according to the known protocol.
The patients were followed 12 months postoperatively.
Pigmentation changes were measured objectively, and with patient and observer ratings.
Patient satisfaction/preference was also obtained.
We present the final study results.
Taken together, pigmentation ratings and objective measures indicate improvement in six of the study participants.
Melanin increase seen 12 months after ReNovaCell treatment in the study group as a whole is notable.
Medical Needling in combination with ReNovaCell shows promise for repigmentation of burn scars.


Abstract
Study epochs were compared (χ2 test, ANOVA).
The excellent predictive performance of the classic scores (revised Baux score and ABSI) was confirmed.
SAPS II was nearly as accurate, particularly in burns <40% TBSA.
Ryan and BOBI scores were least accurate, as they heavily weight inhalation injury.


Abstract
High voltage electrical injury can disrupt the vascular system and lead to extremity amputations.
It is important to protect main vessels from progressive burn necrosis in order to salvage a limb.
The brachial artery should be totally isolated from the burned area by a muscle flap to prevent vessel disruption.
The flap wrapped around the exposed brachial artery segment and luminal status of the artery was assessed using magnetic resonance angiography.
No vascular intervention was required.
The flap survived completely with good elbow function.
Extremity amputation was not encountered.


Abstract
Here we describe differences in treatment outcome in different periods of time.
All patients with scalds who presented to the Linkoping Burn Centre during two periods, early (1997-98) and later (2010-12) were included.
Data were collected in the unit database and analyzed retrospectively.
A lower proportion of autograft operations was found in the later period, falling from 32% to 19%.
Hospital stay was shorter in the later period (3.5 days shorter, p=0.01) and adjusted duration of hospital stay/TBSA% was shorter (1.2 to 0.7, p=0.07).
The two study groups were similar in most of the studied variables: we could not report any significant differences regarding outcome except for unadjusted duration of hospital stay.
Further studies are required to investigate functional and aesthetic outcome differences between the treatment modalities.


Abstract
We feel this potential risk should be further highlighted to the public.

Abstract
This was an observational retrospective cohort study involving burn patients (≥ 20 years old) hospitalized in the ICU of the Burn Facility in Albania during 2010-2014.
Patients were categorized as having euglycaemia, moderate or critical hyperglycaemia.
Regression analysis, hyperglycaemia prediction test and risk measurement were performed for the population.


Abstract
The magnitude of coagulation abnormalities, and the definition and treatment of coagulopathy in burn patients are inadequately understood and continue to be discussed in the literature.
A total of 350 questionnaires were distributed electronically to burn ICU physicians.
Participation was voluntary and anonymous.
The low response rate precludes the generalization of our results.


Abstract
Invasive ventilatory support was required in 44 ICU inpatients (51.8%).
ARDS was diagnosed in 38.6% of patients under invasive mechanical ventilation.
In multivariate analysis, the presence of inhalation injuries was a risk factor for ARDS (OR = 9.75; CI 95% 2.79 - 33.95; P < 0.001).
ARDS is a common complication in burn patients admitted to specialized intensive care units.
Inhalation injuries were an independent risk factor for ARDS.
Mortality rate observed in the study patients was high and associated with ARDS diagnosis.


Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in burn patients.
Recently, it has been recommended that hydroxyethyl starch (HES) be avoided in burn patients because it increases the incidence of AKI.
We conducted an observational study of 165 patients admitted to the critical care burn unit (with 30 ± 15% TBSA burned).
The main outcome measures were incidence of AKI, contributions of colloids and crystalloids, various severity scores, comorbidities, complications and mortality.
According to the RIFLE criteria, 10 (6.1%) patients presented with Risk, 11 (6.7%) presented with Injury and 11 (6.7%) presented with Failure.
According to the AKIN criteria, 9.7% presented stage I, 3% stage II and 10.3% stage III.
Replacement therapy (RRT) was performed in 15 patients (9.1%), but in 6 of them RRT was employed in the final stages of multi-organ failure.


Abstract
A possible relation between source-ground sites and late clinical manifestations was recently emphasized.


Abstract
We carried out a case control study with retrospective analysis from our National Burn Centre registry for the period 1997-2011.
Patients who had been managed with early total excision and autograft were compared with those who had had sequential smaller excisions covered with temporary xenografts until the burn was ready for the final autograft.
The sequential excision and xenograft group (n=42) required one-third fewer autografts than patients in the total excision and autograft group (n=45), who needed more than one operation (p<0.001).
We could not detect any differences in duration of stay in hospital / total body surface area burned% (duration of stay/TBSA%) (2.0 and 1.8) (p=0.83).
However, costs tended to be higher when the burns were > 25% TBSA.


Abstract
Surfasoft® is a monofilament woven polyamide thread.
Its rapid application and transparent property makes it an ideal primary dressing in the absence of any occlusive layers after the first two days following skin graft application.
We modified the use of Surfasoft® in four different burns patients and one skin cancer case.
Surfasoft® was predominantly used on difficult sites and secured with either staples or sutures.
The skin cancer was located on the right shoulder region.
No complications were reported.


Abstract
After admission to the Burns ITU, the patient underwent serial debridement of the burn and coverage with cryopreserved allografts.
Nevertheless, a variable degree of vascularized allo-dermis was clinically identified.


Abstract
Anterior cervical contractures of the neck represent a great challenge for plastic and reconstructive surgeons.
Necks can be reconstructed with a wide range of surgical techniques, including chimeric flaps, supercharged flap, pre-expanded flaps, "superthin" flaps and perforator flaps.
The supraclavicular flap is easy to harvest without the need for free tissue transfer.
It provides a relatively large flap for neck resurfacing with tissue very similar to that of the neck.
Nineteen patients had post-burn neck contractures (9 cases type Іc, 10 cases type Пc) while only one had post-burn granulation tissue in the neck.
We harvested fifteen flaps from the right side and five from the left.
Period of follow up ranged from 27-2months (average 12.3).
Nineteen flaps survived well (95% survival rate): only one was lost due to iatrogenic extensive dissection over the pedicle.
Five cases showed distal superficial epidermolysis, and 2 cases showed 2 cm complete distal necrosis.
All patients were managed conservatively.
Our results coincide with other literature results confirming the efficacy and rich vascularity of this flap.
In all cases with distal partial necrosis, flaps were 23 cm or more.
We recommend that supraclavicular flaps of more than 22 cm in length are not harvested immediately and that flaps are expanded before harvesting.
Expanding the supraclavicular flap increases its surface area and decreases donor site morbidity.


Abstract
Gram-negative infections predominate in burn surgery.
Until recently, Achromobacter species were described as sepsis-causing bacteria in immunocompromised patients only.
Severe infections associated with Achromobacter species in burn patients have been rarely reported.


Abstract
Currently, electronic cigarette (EC) devices are widely used as an alternative to conventional smoking.

Abstract
The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV2) vaccination is efficacious when administered in the first week of life.
Three groups of pigs were vaccinated with Circumvent either early (at the end of week 1), late (at the end of week 4), or not at all.
All 3 groups were later challenged intranasally with PCV2 (at the end of week 5).
Two other groups were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a novel antigen at the end of either week 1 or week 4.
Weight, PCV2 genome copy number in serum and saliva, anti-KLH antibody titer, and serum PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were measured weekly.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate a new recombinant chimeric vaccine against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV).


Abstract
However, effective disinfectants used against PPV are harsh and corrosive to animal health facilities and the environment.


Abstract
This study evaluated the relationship between serum MPO levels and the severity of heart failure (HF) due to chronic mitral valvular insufficiency (CMVI) in dogs.
Serum MPO concentrations in the healthy and CMVI groups were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a canine-specific monoclonal anti-MPO antibody.
Serum MPO concentrations were 273.3 ± 179.6 ng/L in the controls, 140.8 ± 114.1 ng/L in the International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) I group, 109.0 ± 85.2 ng/L in the ISACHC II group, and 106.0 ± 42.3 ng/L in the ISACHC III group.


Abstract
We examined the effects of oral administration of Yunnan Baiyao (YB) on hemostasis by measuring buccal mucosal bleeding times (BMBTs) and doing citrated kaolin-activated whole-blood thromboelastography (TEG).
In a randomized controlled crossover trial 8 beagle dogs were given either placebo or 1000 mg of YB orally every 12 h for 5 consecutive treatments.
Blood was drawn 24 h before treatment and 2 and 24 h after the last treatment, and the BMBT was measured in each sample in duplicate.
The TEG analysis was done in duplicate 60 ± 5 min after sample collection.
There were no adverse effects of treatment and no significant differences between the control and treatment BMBTs or TEG parameters at any time point.
Significant differences were found between baseline and 24 h after the last treatment within the treatment group for the TEG parameters LY30 and LY60 and within the control group for the TEG parameters MA, G, LY30, and LY60.
Thus, at the dose and frequency of administration in this study YB did not appear to have any clinically significant effects on the measured coagulation parameters.
The differences within the treatment group were likely due to analytic error since similar differences were seen in the control group.
Further studies with a larger sample, as well as more direct measures of platelet function, are needed.


Abstract
Periodontal disease is the most common oral disease in cats.
The objectives of this study were to determine the relationships between gingivitis and dental calculus thickness (DCT), or dental calculus coverage (DCC); determine the association of gingivitis scores and types of oral bacteria; and to evaluate bacterial co-infection in cats with periodontal disease.
Twelve cats that were not infected with feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency viruses were enrolled in the study.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of trephination of the frontal sinus and injection of antifungal cream using a medical bone marrow drill in dogs.
Results were compared with frontal sinus trephination using a standard surgical technique.
Bilateral trephination of the frontal sinuses was carried out in the heads of 11 cadavers using a medical bone marrow drill and a surgical bone chuck.
The time taken to carry out the procedure using both techniques was compared.
The mean volume of the sinuses was 8.8 mL (3.1 to 14.3 mL).
Trephination, flushing, and injecting of antifungal cream were significantly faster using the medical technique.


Abstract
Data were compared using a Bland-Altman plot and correlation coefficients, and error measures were calculated.
One hundred and ninety-five sets of data were collected from 20 sheep weighing 41 kg (31 to 51.5 kg).
The bias (95% limit of agreement), correlation coefficient, and absolute error for nasopharyngeal compared to esophageal temperature were 0.04°C (-0.77°C to 0.85°C), 0.92, and 0.29°C ± 0.29°C, respectively.
The percentage of nasopharyngeal readings within 0.5°C of the esophageal temperature was 77.44%.
The error did not significantly increase with increasing fresh gas flow.
Nasopharyngeal temperature measurement is suitable for estimation of esophageal temperature during general anesthesia of sheep when the fresh gas flow through the breathing system is between 1 and 6 L/min.


Abstract
In group N, no treatment was applied.


Abstract
Eating time on day 14 was 290 minutes and significantly longer than on day 1.
The findings showed that eating and rumination are reduced in cows with traumatic reticuloperitonitis and that successful treatment results in rapid normalisation.


Abstract
The Postpartum Dysgalaktie Syndrome (PPDS) also known as metritis agalactia mastitis (MMA), is considered the most common disease of the sow after farrowing.
In 20 of 28 problem farms the PPDS-prevalence could be decreased from 37.4% (± 21.8%) to 24.5% (± 14.1%).
The TI was not significantly reduced.


Abstract
Trends in infectious disease incidence among children in Afghanistan at a time of public health services expansion.
This study reviewed trends in the incidence of common communicable diseases among children under five years in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2013, a period of expansion of public health services.
New visits to outpatient clinics constituted the denominator for calculating proportions.
In 2013, almost three-quarters of all new visits of children to public health services were for an infectious disease, with respiratory infections the most common.
Because of inconsistent data collection for some infections early in the period, the trend for infectious diseases as a whole cannot be estimated.
However, there was a statistically significant downward trend in the proportion of new visits that were diagnosed as one of the 11 leading communicable diseases from 74.5% in 2005 to 62.1% in 2013 (P < 0.001).
There was no difference in communicable disease patterns between provinces, but a higher per capita consultation rate was associated with a higher proportion of the leading infections (P = 0.008).
Recent improvements in maternal health, hygiene, and preventive services may have had an impact in reducing the burden of infections.


Abstract
Self-reported versus proxy reported quality of life for breast cancer patients in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Five oncologists from this centre also evaluated the QoL of these patients.
The patient-caregiver intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for all 15 QLQ.C30 domains was moderate to good (ICC = 0.41-0.76).
In the patient-caregiver comparison there was 55% exact agreement, and for the patient-physician comparison agreement was 45%.
The findings can be used in the patients' decision-making process and care planning when patients with breast cancer are unable to self-report the QoL.


Abstract
Messaging standard requirements for electronic health records in Islamic Republic of Iran: a Delphi study.
The present descriptive-comparative study was conducted to give an overview of the messaging standards that are necessary for interoperable electronic health records (EHRs).
We designed a preliminary model after data collection and compared the messaging standards of Health Level Seven (HL7) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
The data were assessed with the Delphi technique.
A comprehensive model for the messaging standards of EHRs in the Islamic Republic of Iran was presented in three pivots: structural characteristics (standard for all EHRs, XML-based and object-oriented messages, and dual model); model specifications (reference model, archetypes and classes of reference model), and general features (distinct ontology, mapping with other standards, and using reference archetypes for exchanging documents).
In conclusion, we gave an overview of messaging standards for the interoperability of EHRs and experts selected ISO13606 as a suitable standard for the Islamic Republic of Iran.


Abstract
Oral health status, knowledge and practice among pregnant women attending Omdurman maternity hospital, Sudan.
Good oral health is important in pregnancy but little is known about the oral health and knowledge and practices of pregnant Sudanese women.
This cross-sectional study was conducted to address this gap.
A sample of 420 pregnant women attending the prenatal clinic at Omdurman maternity hospital were interviewed and examined for caries and periodontal disease.
The mean age of the women was 27.1 (SD 5.8) years, 52.4% had > primary school education and 7.1% were employed.
Only 12% had a high level of oral health knowledge and 21.2% a positive attitude towards oral health.
Most of the women (65.9%) had poor oral health practices; only 10.2% had visited a dentist during pregnancy.
On clinical examination, 58.6% had healthy gums while 12.1% had bleeding gums and 22.9% had calculus.
The mean decayed, missing and filled teeth value was 1.16 in the age group 16-19 years and 3.49 in age group ≥ 20 years.
These findings suggest the need for oral health programmes as part of prenatal care for pregnant Sudanese women.


Abstract
Factors affecting breastfeeding practices among working women in Pakistan.
This study aimed to assess workplace breastfeeding support provided to working mothers in Pakistan.
In a cross-sectional survey in 2014, mothers and employers from a representative sample of 297 workplaces were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire.
Provision of a lighter job and information about breastfeeding options on return to work were reported from 15% and 5% of the workplaces, respectively.
Only two sites had designated breastfeeding corners.
Public and multinational companies were slightly better than private and national ones in providing breastfeeding facilities.


Abstract
Psychobehavioural responses to the 2014 Middle East respiratory syndrome-novel corona virus (MERS CoV) among adults in two shopping malls in Jeddah, western Saudi Arabia.
Sporadic cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by a novel corona virus (MERS-CoV) were first detected in Saudi Arabia in June 2012.
The number of cases was highest during April and May 2014.
To assess determinants of psychobehavioural responses among the general population in Jeddah, western Saudi Arabia, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at the end of June 2014.
Data included sociodemographic characteristics, level of anxiety, protective measures and social avoidance responses.
A total of 358 participants completed the questionnaire; 58.4% were female, and the age range was 18-72 years.
None of the participants was diagnosed with MERS-CoV.
More than half (57.7%) recorded a moderate anxiety score using a visual analogue scale.
Anxiety level was significantly associated with increased perception of susceptibility to infection and social avoidance behaviours related to travel and being in public places.


Abstract
Association between attitudes towards Internet usage and health practices in high-school students in 2 schools in Turkey: a cross-sectional study.
Excessive usage of the Internet can negatively affect health and health practices especially among youth.
To examine the issue among Turkish students, this study determined the association between high-school students' attitudes towards Internet usage and their health behaviour.
The sample (n = 2043) was randomly drawn from all students at two high schools in Turkey: one in Anatolia and one (a vocational school) in Istanbul.
Data were collected using the Structured Questionnaire, Attitude Scale towards Internet Usage (ASTIU) and Adolescent Lifestyle Profile (ALP).
The mean age of the students was 16.3 years, 77.7% were male and 96.9% used the Internet; mean duration of Internet use was 18.8 h/week.
Female students had more positive attitudes towards Internet usage.
Mean scores for ASTIU and ALP were 72.58 (SD 17.64) and 111.34 (SD 16.61) respectively, which were average levels.
There was a statistically significant but weak overall negative correlation between adolescents' attitudes towards Internet usage and their health behaviour.
Our results concur with studies in different cultures which suggest some negative effects, of heavy Internet use.

Implementation of a mentored professional development programme in laboratory leadership and management in the Middle East and North Africa.
This success is encouraging and could serve as a model to further strengthen laboratory capacity in the Region.


Abstract
While much progress was made in the following decades, preclinical research still often ignores sex as a fundamental biological variable.
Many neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and migraine, show strong sex differences in incidence and disease manifestation.
In this commentary, we highlight case studies of neurological disorders affecting men and women to demonstrate the need for more such studies.


Abstract
The cellular mechanisms are best modeled in rodents and have provided both unifying principles and surprising specifics.
Non-neuronal cells and inflammatory mediators are found in greater number and at higher levels in parts of male brains.
This higher baseline of inflammation is speculated to increase male vulnerability to developmental neuropsychiatric disorders that are triggered by inflammation.


Abstract
Many neural and behavioral functions are affected by estrogens, including mood, cognitive function, blood pressure regulation, motor coordination, pain, and opioid sensitivity.


Abstract
This is supported by an underlying clinical rationale that studying both sexes is necessary to elucidate pathophysiology and develop treatments for the entire population.
However, at a more basic level, sex differences, like genetic differences, can be exploited to better understand biology.
Here, we discuss how sex differences at the molecular level of cell signaling and protein trafficking are amplified to create a state of vulnerability that under the right conditions can result in symptoms of neuropsychiatry disease.
Although this dialogue focuses on the specific example of corticotropin-releasing factor, the potential for analogous sex differences in signaling and/or trafficking of receptors for other neuromodulators has broad biological and therapeutic implications.


Abstract
In rodents, short-term estradiol intake in female rats enhances acquisition and escalation of drug taking, motivation for drugs of abuse, and relapse-like behaviors.
There is also a sex difference in the dopamine response in the nucleus accumbens.
Estradiol treatment of ovariectomized female rats enhances stimulated dopamine release in the dorsolateral striatum, but not in the nucleus accumbens, resulting in a sex difference in the balance between these two dopaminergic projections.
The sex difference in the balance between these neural systems is proposed to underlie sex differences in addiction.


Abstract
Trauma-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are remarkably common and debilitating, and are often characterized by dysregulated threat responses.
Across numerous epidemiological studies, females have been found to have an approximately twofold increased risk for PTSD and other stress-related disorders.
Understanding the biological mechanisms of this differential risk is of critical importance.
Recent data suggest that the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) pathway is a critical regulator of the stress response across species.
We have recently shown that PACAP and its receptor (PAC1R) are critical mediators of abnormal processes after psychological trauma.
Notably, in heavily traumatized human subjects, there appears to be a robust sex-specific association of PACAP blood levels and PAC1R gene variants with fear physiology, PTSD diagnosis, and symptoms, specifically in females.
The sex-specific association occurs within a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2267735) that resides in a putative estrogen response element involved in PAC1R gene regulation.
Complementing these human data, the PAC1R messenger RNA is induced with fear conditioning or estrogen replacement in rodent models.
These data suggest that perturbations in the PACAP-PAC1R pathway are regulated by estrogen and are involved in abnormal fear responses underlying PTSD.


Abstract
One of the most sexually dimorphic aspects of metabolic regulation is the bidirectional modulation of glucose and energy homeostasis by testosterone in males and females.
Testosterone deficiency predisposes men to metabolic dysfunction, with excess adiposity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes, whereas androgen excess predisposes women to insulin resistance, adiposity, and type 2 diabetes.
This review discusses how testosterone acts in the central nervous system, and especially the hypothalamus, to promote metabolic homeostasis or dysfunction in a sexually dimorphic manner.
We also discuss how the metabolic effect of testosterone is centrally mediated via the androgen receptor.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the number one cause of disability worldwide and is comorbid with many chronic diseases, including obesity/metabolic syndrome (MetS).


Abstract
Suffering related to dementia is multifaceted because cognitive and physical functioning slowly deteriorates.
Advanced age and sex, two of the most prominent risk factors for dementia, are not modifiable.
Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol use, and poor diet modulate susceptibility to dementia in both males and females.
The degree to which the resulting health conditions (eg, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) impact dementia risk varies by sex.
Depending on the subtype of dementia, the ratio of male to female prevalence differs.
This review examines sex and gender differences in the development of dementia with the goal of highlighting factors that require further investigation.
Considering sex as a biological variable in dementia research promises to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of these conditions.

This paper will review the history and current research on sex effects of antidepressant treatment.


Abstract
Sex differences in the placenta, which begin with sex chromosomes, are likely to produce sex-specific transplacental signals to the developing brain.
Our studies and others have identified X-linked genes that are expressed at higher levels in the female placenta.


Abstract
Childhood recurrent abdominal pain and Helicobacter pylori infection, Islamic Republic of Iran.
We examined the role of Helicobacter pylori infection as a cause of recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) among Iranian children in a population-based case-control study to determine the association between H. pylori infection and RAP among schoolchildren.
A total of 1558 children aged 6-13 years were examined.
Children with RAP confirmed by the Apley and Naish criteria were selected; 145 cases were selected for inclusion and were compared with 145 healthy children recruited from the same area.
Both groups underwent stool antigen testing.
The prevalence of RAP in the children tested was 9.3%.
Children with RAP had a higher H. pylori infection rate than the control group (58.6% vs 44.8%) (OR = 1.744; 95% CI: 1.095-2.776).
There was no significant difference between the RAP symptoms in children with positive stool test, i.e. infected with H. pylori, and those whose tests were negative.
We identified H. pylori infection in more than 55% of the case group.
Therefore, H. pylori infection can be considered an important factor for RAP in children.


Abstract
Effect of social networking on academic achievement of dental students, Jazan University, Saudi Arabia.
We investigated the effect of social networking (SN) on academic achievement of dental students at Jazan University, Saudi Arabia.
A self-administered questionnaire was distributed during the 2015/16 academic year to all dental students and data were analysed by SPSS version 21.
There were 348 participants (70% response rate) and 53% were male.
Fifty-one percent of participants reported that they studied just before examinations, and 51% scored 3.5-4.5 Grade Point Average (GPA) in the last semester.
Up to 98% of the participants reported using their smartphones/ computers for SN, with 93% doing so on a daily basis, and 66% reported SN during lectures, laboratories and clinics.
Fifty-seven percent thought that SN affected their study negatively, and 65% thought that their GPA would improve if they stopped or reduced SN.
Students who spent more hours each day on SN had lower GPA scores.
SN negatively affected the academic achievement of dental students.
Further evaluation and tailored educational programmes are needed to increase students' awareness about the negative effects of SN.


Abstract
Smoking prevalence, knowledge and attitudes among primary healthcare professionals: a study from Jordan.
This was a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study of 400 healthcare professionals recruited from primary healthcare centres in northern Jordan between April and October 2015.
More than 80% of participants reported that smoking-free policies were not enforced at primary healthcare centres.
Compared to hospitals and the general population, smoking was less prevalent among primary healthcare professionals and more prevalent in men.
More than 90% of participants believed that smoking was dangerous and associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
Around 92% believed that they should set a good example to patients by not smoking and advise them about smoking cessation.
Only 15.3% of participants felt well prepared when counselling patients about smoking and 92.8% believed that they needed training.
This study suggests that primary healthcare professionals should act as anti-smoking role models after receiving professional training.


Abstract
Distribution of ophthalmologists and optometrists in Islamic Republic of Iran and their associated factors.
We aimed to determine the distribution of ophthalmic care providers and its correlation with health and socioeconomic status and health system indicators.
Data were gathered from the Iran Medical Council and the Iranian Societies of Ophthalmology and Optometry.
Concurrent indicators were collected from the Statistical Center of Iran and national studies.
A population-adjusted number of combined ophthalmologists and optometrists was used as the main dependent variable.
Optometrist/ophthalmologist ratio was 0.9.
We had 1 ophthalmologist and 1 optometrist for every 40 000 and 45 000 individuals, respectively.
We observed a direct correlation between the number of ophthalmologists, optometrists and life expectancy at the provincial level.
Gross provincial income and expenditure and provincial literacy were correlated as well.
Provincial unemployment had a negative correlation.
Provincial hospital statistics and population density were also significantly correlated.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has met the World Health Organization's desired per capita number of ophthalmologists and optometrists, but there is wide variation in their density.


Abstract
Association of overweight and obesity with decline in academic performance among female high-school students, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between overweight/obesity and future academic performance among high-school students in Saudi Arabia.
This was a retrospective cohort study of 257 12th grade female students in Alabna (Ministry of Defence) high schools in Riyadh during 2013/14.
Overweight/obesity was based on weight and height at 10th grade.
Decline in academic performance was defined as a reduction by > 1 standard deviation in marks between 10th and 12th grades.
One hundred and five students were overweight/obese and 30 had declined academic performance.
Self-esteem scale was similar in both groups.
In a multiple logistic regression model adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, study-related lifestyle and self-esteem, overweight/obesity was associated with declining academic performance.
Other independent associates included paternal and maternal education, and living outside governmentally provided housing.
We report a negative independent association between overweight/obesity and subsequent academic performance among female high-school students in Saudi Arabia.
The results highlight the need for community and school programmes to target overweight/obesity among high-school students.


Abstract
Multidrug-resistant bacteria among patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia in an emergency intensive care unit, Egypt.
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common hospital-acquired infection among mechanically ventilated patients.
Our objectives were to determine the incidence of VAP, isolate multidrug-resistant bacteria, identify the most prevalent resistant strains and identify their antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
The VAP rate was calculated.
The isolated microbes were identified and tested for antibiotic susceptibilities.
The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem for Klebsiella isolates.
Klebsiella isolates resistant to carbapenems were tested for the presence of the blaKPC gene.
The VAP incidence density rate was 48.8 incidences/1 000 ventilator days.
The most common Gram-positive organism was Staphylococcus aureus, of which 86.6% of isolates were resistant to cefoxitin , but 100% were sensitive to teicoplanin, linezolid and tigecycline.
The most common Gram-negative bacillus was Klebsiella, of which 94.6% of isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, 70.2% to imipenem, and 64.9% to ertapenem, but 100% were sensitive to colistin and 94.6% were sensitive to tigecycline.
Of the carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains, 23.1% had the blaKPC gene.
The high rates of VAP and the high rates of resistance among isolated organisms point to improper implementation of infection control programmes.


Abstract
A partnership model to improve population health screening for noncommunicable conditions and their common risk factors, Qazvin, Islamic Republic of Iran.

Preliminary analysis of the results suggests that the framework has successfully engaged private care providers.


Abstract
Water usage in the Gaza Strip: recommendations from a literature review and consultations with experts.
Water quality in the Gaza Strip has been severely compromised due to increasing salinity, contamination with pollutants, and lack of adequate treatment options.
Specific advice was developed for several vulnerable groups, including infants, children, pregnant or lactating women, and elderly people.
The recommendations are inherently limited, as it is unacceptable to recommend consuming water that is of substandard quality.
However, pending long-term solutions, information can be targeted to vulnerable groups to ensure that exposure to the most harmful contaminants is avoided.
The implementation of these recommendations may require information campaigns to assist the population in differentiating water from different sources for different uses.

Abstract
Following a suggestion from Warren Weaver, we extend the Shannon model of communication piecemeal into a complex systems model in which communication is differentiated both vertically and horizontally.
This model enables us to bridge the divide between Niklas Luhmann's theory of the self-organization of meaning in communications and empirical research using information theory.
First, we distinguish between communication relations and correlations among patterns of relations.
The correlations span a vector space in which relations are positioned and can be provided with meaning.
Second, positions provide reflexive perspectives.
Whereas the different meanings are integrated locally, each instantiation opens global perspectives - 'horizons of meaning' - along eigenvectors of the communication matrix.
These next-order codifications of meaning can be expected to generate redundancies when interacting in instantiations.
Increases in redundancy indicate new options and can be measured as local reduction of prevailing uncertainty (in bits).
The systemic generation of new options can be considered as a hallmark of the knowledge-based economy.


Abstract
The study also shows that there are different modes of reflexivity, which have varied effects on charity and volunteering.


Abstract
Epidemiology of rabies in Oman: a retrospective study (1991-2013).
Animal bites and rabies are under-reported in many developing countries and there is poor understanding of the disease burden.
The aim of this study was to map the epidemiology of animal bites and rabies in Oman over the period 1991-2013.
In a cross-sectional, descriptive, surveillance-based study, all data about animal bites and rabies from the national communicable disease surveillance system were analysed.
A total of 22 788 cases of animal bites were reported.
Most bites were to males (70%) and the 10-19 year age group (26%).
Cats were the most common animal and upper extremities were the most common bite site.
There were 8 rabies cases reported during the study period, mostly due to bites from wild animals, with 100% mortality.
Of 758 suspected animals tested, 56.1% were positive for rabies; foxes had the highest positivity rate (70.1%).
The high incidence of animal bites in Oman emphasizes the importance of a rabies prevention and control programme.

Abstract
Health-seeking behaviour of people living with HIV/AIDS and their satisfaction with health services provided at a tertiary care hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.
This study aimed to assess the health-seeking behaviour and satisfaction with health care services of people living with HIV/AIDS attending the HIV/AIDS clinic of the Civil Hospital in Karachi.
A total of 182 patients were interviewed using a pretested semi-structured questionnaire.
Mean age of the participants was 32.31 (SD 7.91) years, 76.9% were male, 81.3% had no education and 75.8% were employed.
Only 23.6% showed positive health-seeking behaviour and 57.7% were satisfied with the health care services.
In logistic regression analysis, the cost of treatment per visit < US$ 5 and duration of HIV infection < 2 years were significantly associated with health-seeking behaviour.
Efforts are needed to improve the health-seeking behaviour of people living with HIV/AIDS at the clinic and the health services offered.


Abstract
Incidence and determinants of severity of unintentional injuries among students of private schools in Dubai: a cross-sectional study.
The study was in two phases.
The second was to study the determinants of severity through randomly selecting 1000 cases of injuries.
A self-administered questionnaire was given to the participants after obtaining verbal consent.
Sociodemographic characteristics showed that most (74.2%) of the students in this study were male and about half (57.3%) were aged 12-14 years.
The incidence rate of injuries was 297.7/1000, and most of the injuries (88.9%) were mild.
Poor school safety was blamed for most of the injuries, and falls were the most frequent type of injury.


Abstract
Medical errors in neonatal intensive care unit at Benha University Hospital, Egypt.
This study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Benha University Hospital, Egypt from 1 August 2012 to the 31 January 2013 to identify medical errors and to determine the risk factors and consequences of these errors.
Errors were detected by follow-up of neonates and review of reports including nursing followup sheets, resident progression notes and investigation reports.
We detected 3819 errors that affected 97% of neonates.
Types of errors included 403 medication errors (10.55% of total errors), 652 errors in daily routine procedures (17.07%), 1042 errors in invasive procedures (27.28%), 68 errors in nutrition (1.78%), 63 equipment errors (1.64%), 260 administration errors (6.8%), 656 staffing errors (17.18%), 107 environmental errors (2.8%), 448 infection control errors (11.73%) and 120 nosocomial infection errors (3.14%).
Medical errors were high in low birth weight, low gestational age neonates and increased with duration of admission.


Abstract
Burnout and sources of stress among medical residents at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar.
This study aimed to describe the experiences of stress and burnout and sociodemographic factors associated with dimensions of stress among medical residents at Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar.
Medical residents participating in a stress management course were asked to complete an anonymous survey.
The survey included demographic questions, the Abbreviated Maslach Inventory, and 4 open-ended questions on experiences with stress.
They listed an average of 3.1 coping strategies, most frequently seeking out social support and entertainment.
Responses indicated low depersonalization, high personal accomplishment, high satisfaction with medicine and high emotional exhaustion.
Training to improve coping and reduce burnout is recommended.


Abstract
The capability approach: a guiding framework to improve population health and the attainment of the Sustainable Developmental Goals.
The world is progressing in terms of communication, innovative technology and cure of various diseases through advanced pharmacological preparations.
Unfortunately, populations are still struggling with ill-health, disabilities, poverty, hunger, inequality, gender disparities and conflicts.
Several questions come to mind in this regard: why are prosperity, health, peace and progress not evenly distributed and what is the best approach to address the issues associated with population health?
The capability approach may offer a possible model.
This approach is a blend of 5 key concepts: capabilities, functioning, agency, endowment, and conversion factors.
It proposes an innovative approach to examine and enhance the quality of life and wellbeing of individuals.


Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the differences in the characteristics of short- and long-term surviving dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and to identify factors that predict its outcome.
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 59 client- owned dogs with PLE diagnosed at three different hospitals between January 2009 and November 2013.
The dogs were classified as either short-term (= 6 months; STs) or long-term (> 6 months; LTs) survivors.
Clinical and clinicopathological variables were investigated between the groups and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed.
Nineteen dogs were classified as STs and 40 as LTs.
Body weight and blood urea nitrogen concentrations were significantly higher in the STs at diagnosis (P < 0.05).


Abstract
The responsibilities for the programmatic, technical and financial support of health programmes are increasingly being passed from external donors to governments.
Programmes for family planning, human immunodeficiency virus, immunization, malaria and tuberculosis have already faced such donor transition, which is a difficult and often political process.
Wherever programmes and services aimed at vulnerable populations are primarily supported by donors, the post-transition future is uncertain.
Overreliance on donor support is often a reflection of limited domestic political commitment.
Limited commitment, which is frequently expressed as the persecution of vulnerable groups, poses a risk to individuals as well as to the effectiveness and sustainability of health programmes.
We argue that, for reasons linked to human rights, the social contract and the cost-effectiveness of health promotion, prevention and treatment programmes, it is critical that governments sustain health services for vulnerable populations during and after donor transition.
Although civil society organizations could help by engaging with government stakeholders, pushing to change social norms and supporting mechanisms that demand accountability, they may be constrained by economic, political and social factors.
Vulnerable populations need to be actively involved in the planning and implementation of donor transition - to ensure that their voice and needs are taken into account and to establish a platform that improves visibility and accountability.


Abstract
Since resistance begins to emerge as soon as an antibiotic is used, Norway's practice of leaving newer antibiotics on the shelf is consistent with the goal of prolonging the effectiveness of newer antibiotics.
Every country aims to improve infection control and to promote responsible antibiotic use.
However, as progress is made, antibiotic-resistant bacteria should become less common and, consequently, the need for, and the commercial value of, novel antibiotics will probably be reduced.
Nevertheless, antibiotic innovation continues to be essential.

Abstract
Oral probiotic administration has been advocated for treatment and prevention of a diverse range of disorders.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation on outcome of pediatric post-burn patients.
Clinical outcomes, including GIT tolerance, incidence of infection, need for grafting, length of hospital stay and mortality were recorded.
Laboratory measurements of serum CRP, serum albumin, serum IgA and total lymphocyte count were done upon admission and on days 4, 7 and 14.
There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age (3.67 ± 0.67 vs. 3.56 ± 0.73), sex, %BSA (34.5 ± 1.96 vs. 33.9 ± 1.82) and %deep burns (6.95 ± 0.34 vs. 7.25 ± 0.39).
Frequency of diarrhea (3 vs. 9), need for grafting (2 vs. 8) and length of hospital stay (17.25 ± 0.5 days vs. 21.9 ± 2.2 days) were significantly lower in the probiotic group (p=0.038, p=0.028 and p=0.044, respectively).
A trend towards a decrease in incidence of infections (7 vs. 12) was noted in the probiotic group (p=0.113).
There was no mortality in our series.
There was improvement in the patients' overall outcome related to wound healing and length of hospital stay following the use of probiotics.
However, their effects on infectious morbidity and mortality remain unclear and require further investigation.

Abstract
Infection is one of the major causes of death in pediatric burns in India.
This work was conducted in an exclusive Children's Hospital (KKCTH) with a total of 220 beds, of which ten beds in the burn unit and two isolation beds in the 28-bed PICU are for burns patients (more than 20% TBSA burns) with sepsis.
In this study, 30 burn wound swab isolates obtained from 14 pediatric burns patients (admitted to the burns ward and transferred to PICU) from November 2013 to March 2014 were investigated.
The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus aureus.


Abstract
The extensive loss of skin in burned patients is a critical clinical condition, and the choice of an effective technique to cover and protect the damaged area has always been a challenge in the surgical field.
Despite its wide clinical use, there is little data in the literature on using the Alexander technique to treat severe burns, while several studies have focused on alternative approaches.
The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Alexander surgical technique on 117 patients with severe burns.
The characteristics of the burned patients, factors related to etiology of burns as well as adverse prognostic factors and their incidence in discharged versus deceased patients were also taken into account.
Finally, a comparison is made with an alternative surgical procedure described in the literature.
Our results show a satisfactory level of survival for patients with severe burns surgically treated with the Alexander technique, accounting for 63% of all clinical cases reported here.
This treatment is also less expensive and more rapid than the alternative approach we compared it with.
The Alexander technique is a lifesaving method for the treatment of severe burns that provides a satisfactory chance of survival at lower cost than the alternative surgical procedure examined.

In particular, the participants were satisfied with their close relationships.


Abstract
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal disorder worldwide.
The disease is characterized by renal cysts and progressive renal failure due to progressive enlargement of cysts and renal fibrosis.
An estimated 45% to 70% of patients with ADPKD progress to end-stage renal disease by age 65 years.
Although both targeted and nontargeted therapies have been tested in patients with ADPKD, tolvaptan is currently the only pharmacological therapy approved in Canada for the treatment of ADPKD.
The purpose of this consensus recommendation is to develop an evidence-informed recommendation for the optimal management of adult patients with ADPKD.
This document focuses on the role of genetic testing, the role of renal imaging, predicting the risk of disease progression, and pharmacological treatment options for ADPKD.
These areas of focus were derived from 2 national surveys that were disseminated to nephrologists and patients with ADPKD with the aim of identifying unmet needs in the management of ADPKD in Canada.
Specific recommendations are provided for the treatment of ADPKD with tolvaptan.


Abstract
At this time the literature exploring this symptom is limited, and to our knowledge very few cases have been described in the child and adolescent population.
We report here the cases of one child and one adolescent presenting with significant weight loss, food restriction and fear of vomiting.
The child's fear of vomiting masked a concurrent desire to achieve fitness and weight loss, which was uncovered following weight restoration.
The adolescent patient, although significantly underweight and food avoidant, also expressed no concerns with body image, until weight restored.
The history, course in hospital and management of these patients is discussed, along with several challenges that complicated the diagnosis.


Abstract
Although the technique of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has been a revolution in the alleviation of male infertility, the use of testicular sperm for ICSI was a formerly unseen breakthrough in the treatment of the azoospermic man with primary testicular failure.
At the clinical level, different procedures of testicular sperm retrieval (conventional TESE, micro-TESE, FNA/TESA, MESA, PESA) are being performed, the choice is mainly based on the cause of azoospermia (obstructive versus non-obstructive) and the surgeon's skills.
At the level of the IVF laboratory, mechanical procedures to harvest the sperm from the tissue may be combined with enzymatic treatment in order to increase the sperm recovery rates.
A number of techniques have been developed for viable sperm selection in males with only immotile testicular sperm available.
However, large, well-designed studies on the benefit and safety of one over the other technique are lacking.
Despite all the available methods and combinations of laboratory procedures which have a common goal to maximize sperm recovery from testicular samples, a large proportion of NOA patients fail to father a genetically own child.
Advanced technology application may improve recovery rates by detection of the testicular foci with active spermatogenesis and/or identification of the rare individual sperm in the testicular suspensions.
On the other hand, in vitro spermatogenesis or sperm production from embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells might be future options.
The present review summarizes the available strategies which aim to maximize sperm recovery from surgically retrieved samples.


Abstract
The objectives of this study were to assess the microbiological and physical/chemical quality of water in broiler turkey farms in the province of Khemisset (north-western Morocco) and, based on a questionnaire, to ascertain potential risk factors for contamination of drinking water with faecal coliforms.
A total of 80 samples were collected and analysed in 20 farms (four from each farm).
A significant reduction in microbiological contamination of the water line (p < 0.05) was observed on Day 60.
While more than 90% of the samples were of satisfactory quality in terms of pH, nitrites, conductivity, nitrates and iron, only 35% were satisfactory in terms of total hardness and only 20% met quality standards for ammonium content.
The factors affecting levels of contamination with faecal coliforms were water chlorination (p = 0.065; odds ratio = 14; 90% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14-71), cleaning and disinfection (p = 0.028; odds ratio = 14; 95% CI = 1.25-156.6) and antibiotic treatment (p = 0.001; odds ratio = 6; 95% CI = 2.1-35.2).
To improve water quality in poultry farms, farmers are advised to protect wells from contamination and to install water purification units (pre-oxidation, coagulation, flocculation, disinfection).
In addition, turkey houses and rearing equipment should be rigorously cleaned and disinfected between each batch of birds.


Abstract
This study evaluates hygiene practices on 53 dairy farms in the Jijel and Blida regions of Algeria.
In parallel, bacteriological analyses were carried out to estimate the rate, source and development of bacterial contamination in raw milk produced on the farm.
In addition, screening was performed to detect the presence of inhibitor residues.
The results of the survey revealed poor livestock conditions and milking practices that could explain the presence of bacteria in cow's milk.
The bacteriological results showed that 76.1% of milk samples taken from cow udders complied with legal standards, compared with only 35.8% of milk samples taken from storage tanks.
Moreover, bacterial inhibitors were detected in 28.8% of milk samples.
These results showed that the hands of milkers, udders, teat cups, utensils, the water used during milking and the milking environment were all potential sources of milk contamination by the bacteria under investigation.


Abstract
Leptospirosis is a common infection in domestic animals.
The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is used for serological diagnosis.

This study reports the complex epidemiological features of leptospirosis.


Abstract
In February 2014, an assessment was made of the suitability and sensitivity of different types of sample for the detection of MERSCoV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for three gene targets: UpE (upstream of the E gene), the N (nucleocapsid) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a.
Fifty-three animals presented for slaughter were sampled.
Among the virus-positive animals, nasal swabs were most often positive (97.6%).
Oral swabs were the second most frequently positive (35.7%), followed by rectal swabs (28.5%).


Abstract
All of these samples came from dairy herds whose seroprevalence was also evaluated.
The specificity figures, for gE and gB ELISAs, respectively, were 88.4% and 99.1% for infection-free herds and 72.6% and 96% for herds with <20% seroprevalence.


Abstract
Infectious bursal disease (also known as Gumboro disease) is an immunosuppressive viral disease specific to chickens.
It is still prevalent in properly vaccinated flocks carrying specific antibodies at levels normally high enough to prevent the disease.
Common causes apart, failure of vaccination against infectious bursal disease is associated mainly with early vaccination in flocks of unknown immune status and with the evolution of viruses circulating in the field, leading to antigenic drift and a sharp rise in pathogenicity.
Various highly sensitive molecular techniques have clarified the viral determinants of antigenicity and pathogenicity of the infectious bursal disease virus.
However, these markers are not universally recognised and tend to be considered as evolutionary markers.
Antigenic variants of the infectious bursal disease virus possess modified neutralising epitopes that allow them to evade the action of maternally-derived or vaccine-induced antibodies.
Autogenous or multivalent vaccines are required to control antigenic variants in areas where classical and variant virus strains coexist.
Pathotypic variants (very virulent viruses) remain antigenically related to classical viruses.
The difficulty in controlling pathotypic variants is linked to the difficulty of eliciting an early immune response, because of the risk of the vaccine virus being neutralised by maternal antibodies.
Mathematical calculation of the optimal vaccination time and the use of vaccines resistant to maternally-derived antibodies have improved the control of very virulent viruses.

Abstract
Honeybees are threatened by various pathogens and parasites.
More than 18 viruses have been described in honeybees and many of them have been detected in China and Argentina.
In China, both Apis cerana and Apis mellifera are raised.
A thorough study was carried out in both China and Argentina to analyse the current virus presence and distribution in different climatic zones and gather information on different bee species/subspecies.
Interestingly, multiple infections were commonly found in China, with up to five different viruses co-circulating in some colonies without apparent abnormalities.
In this study, no Chinese samples were positive for slow bee paralysis virus.
The most prevalent viruses were BQCV (China) and DWV (Argentina).
Kashmir bee virus was absent from samples analysed for both countries.


Abstract
Among mammalian hosts, equines and humans are the most sensitive to WNV infection and can develop severe meningoencephalitis.
As WNV infections are zoonotic and can be severe in humans and equines, West Nile fever is considered to be a public and animal health concern.
In total, 49 horses were found to be infected; among them, 44 presented clinical signs, 41 with meningoencephalitis and three with hyperthermia only.
The authors describe the characteristics of the 2015 WNV epizootics, the early detection of the first WNV equine cases via the RESPE network and the coordination of WNV surveillance in France.


Abstract
Epidemiological surveillance in dairy farms in the Pastaza province of Ecuador.
In only one of the nine areas of application covered in the guide was compliance with technical requirements greater than 70%: milking and milk handling (78.59%).
In the following areas, a compliance rate of 40-65% was achieved: records and traceability; siting of livestock farms and infrastructure, facilities and equipment; use and quality of water and animal feed; and management of veterinary products and agricultural pesticides.
In the remaining areas, the compliance rate was less than 20%.
On average, there was only 27.96% compliance with the technical elements evaluated.


Abstract

Abstract
Cattle play an important role in the epidemiology of bluetongue (BT) by acting as reservoir hosts.
However, the status of BT virus (BTV) in dairy cattle in Nepal is unknown.
The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of BTV antibodies in dairy cattle in two eco-zones of Nepal, and to identify the factors associated with virus exposure.
The authors conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey from March 2012 through February 2013 by sampling 131 dairy cattle from seven clusters (villages) in the Chitwan district in the Terai region (southern lowlands) and the Lamjung district in the Hills region (the middle part of Nepal).
Of the 131 serum samples tested, 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.5-37.2) were positive for BTV antibodies.
Herd-level seroprevalence was 45.7% (95% CI: 30.9-61.0).
Bivariate analysis indicated a positive association between seroconversion to BTV and age, and an association with breed of cattle after controlling for clustering of animals within herds.
Based on this model, cattle were more likely to become seropositive as they aged.
Crossbred cattle were more likely to be seropositive than those of exotic breeds (odds ratio [OR] = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.5-14.1).
The results indicate widespread exposure of dairy cattle to BTV in Nepal.


Abstract
Approximately five million live ruminants are imported annually into Saudi Arabia.
The majority of these animals are imported shortly before the pilgrimage season from Sudan and the Horn of Africa, where foot and mouth disease (FMD) is known to be enzootic.
This study was designed to investigate the impact of the importation of these live ruminants on the epizootiology of FMD in Saudi Arabia.
Among the cattle, 120 (51.5%) of 233 animals tested positive for FMD virus (FMDV) antibodies.
The findings highlight the risks associated with the annual importation of live ruminants from FMD-enzootic areas.
The risks include the possible introduction of new exotic FMDV serotypes, particularly when potential carriers or subclinically infected animals are considered.
An understanding of the epidemiology of different strains and the ability to track their movement between geographical regions is essential for the development of efficient control strategies for the disease.
Therefore, genotyping of FMDV strains isolated from imported and local animals is recommended.


Abstract
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals, including cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and certain wildlife species.
The disease can cause massive economic losses when introduced into countries that were free from the infection, generating negative effects due to reduced animal productivity and restrictions on international livestock trade.
Following 15 years of FMD absence, Tunisia and Algeria experienced an incursion of the disease in 2014.
The epidemiological situation and disease control measures in operation for FMD in the North African region are not homogeneous.
The FMD virus detected in Tunisia and Algeria during the epidemic in 2014 showed 99% identity with a strain isolated in Libya in 2013.
Morocco was not affected by the 2014 epidemic but it started a preventive vaccination campaign for cattle in August of that year.
The relatively short distance between the North African continent and southern Europe may facilitate the introduction of pathogens, including FMD virus.
The history of infectious diseases demonstrates that the Mediterranean Sea is not a sufficient barrier to viral infections.
Regional platforms such as the Mediterranean Animal Health Network (REMESA) could play a crucial role in coordinating and managing animal health crises, such as the 2014 FMD epidemic.


Abstract
Nucleotide sequences of field strains of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) contribute to our understanding of the distribution and evolution of viral lineages that circulate in different regions of the world.

Abstract
Prevalence and determinants of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among a sample of adult smokers in Baghdad, Iraq, 2014.
This cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and identify determinants of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among a convenience sample of 325 adult smokers in Baghdad, Iraq, 2014.
Those with FEV1/FVC ratio <70% had post bronchodilator spirometry; those with FEV1/FVC% of <70% and <200 ml improvement of FEV1 were considered COPD cases.
The prevalence of COPD was 15.1% (95% confidence interval 11.5-19.4%); 62.5% had moderate and 27.1% had severe COPD.
Only 12.5% had a prior physician diagnosis.
Age >55 (OR=2.14, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-4.39), and pack year smoking >40 (OR =5.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.70-16.91) were the significant independent determinants.
All adult smokers should have a spirometry testing and counseled to stop smoking.


Abstract
Dentists' perception of primary health care services in family health and mother and child health clinics in Alexandria, Egypt.
This study compared dentists' perceptions of provided services in Family Health (FH) and Mother and Child Health (MCH) clinics.
A questionnaire was distributed to 120 dentists in 7 FH and 4 MCH clinics in Alexandria, Egypt in 2012.
The questionnaire assessed personal and professional background, perceptions of primary health care (PHC) role, types of services provided, patient recall and referral systems and perception of service quality.
The response rate was 100%.
More FH dentists perceived their role to include providing care for children and pregnant women.
Restorations and scaling were provided by 90% of all dentists.
More FH dentists reported providing simple extractions, paediatric extractions and multi-rooted endodontic treatment (P = 0.03, 0.001 and 0.001).
Thus, there is a need for the establishment of a mission and clear guidelines for the FH clinics to guide service provision.

Abstract
Evaluation of the prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking and its related factors in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study is designed to evaluate the prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking and its related factors among Iranian adults.
This is a cross-sectional study carried out during 2013/14 in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, among 1830 citizens aged over 15 years.
Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) questionnaire for waterpipe consumption was used for data gathering.
Data were statistically analyzed by SPSS software.
Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, cigarette consumption, waterpipe consumption at home and ignorance of safety issues significantly influenced current waterpipe smoking (P = 0.001).
Thus, prevalence of waterpipe smoking in Iranian adults is high and significant.
Tackling waterpipe smoking should be considered in tobacco control programmes.
However, further studies in this field are needed.

A questionnaire was designed based on the national guide for safe management of healthcare waste in order to investigate the reality of liquid medical waste management in a sample of hospitals in Damascus.
The questionnaire was subsequently distributed and collected during April and May 2015.
The study found that there are a number of negative points in these guidelines as well as several weaknesses in their implementation.


Abstract
Lebanon's experience in surveillance of communicable diseases during a mass gathering: Sixth Francophone Games, 2009.
In 2009, Lebanon hosted the 6th Francophone Games.
Pandemic A(H1N1)2009 virus presented significant health threat at the time.
A surveillance strategy was implemented for the timely detection and management of epidemiological events and outbreaks, in particular for A(H1N1)2009 virus cases.
Data were collected and managed daily and feedback was generated through daily bulletins.
A total of 299 medical consultations were reported, 29% of which related to infectious diseases.
Twenty-three cases of gastroenteritis were reported, for which 11 stool cultures were negative.
While pandemic A(H1N1)2009 did not interfere with the Games, it was essential to strengthen surveillance and to have timely epidemiological information.
This was achieved through preparedness, a multi-disciplinary approach, timely management and coordination.

Abstract
The Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance.
A mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene, a glycoprotein which is the main constituent of the extracellular matrix, is the cause of the disease.
The cardinal features involve the skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems.
In children, phenotypical manifestations are age dependent.
For these reasons, the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome might be lately revealed by its cardiovascular complications.

Abstract
Caring for a sick child represents a high risk activity that requires technical and non-technical skills related to several factors such as the rarity of certain events or the stress of caring for a child.
As regard these conditions, medi¬cal simulation provides a learning environment without risk, the control of variables, the reproducibility of situations, and the confrontation with rare events.
In this article, we des¬cribe the steps of a simulation session and outline the current knowledge of the use of simulation in paediatrics.
A session of simulation includes seven phases following the model of Peter Dieckmann, particularly the scenario and the debriefing that form the heart of the learning experience.
Several studies have shown the advantages of simulation for paediatric trai¬ning in terms of changes in attitudes, skills and knowledge.
Some studies have demonstrated a beneficial transfer to prac¬tice.
In conclusion, simulation provides great potential for training and research in paediatrics.
The establishment of a collaborative research program by the whole simulation com¬munity would help ensure that this type of training improves the quality of care.


Abstract
However, the eruptions are occasionally severe and extensive.

Abstract
Until recently, the recommendations of infective endocarditis were based on expert opinions, due to its low incidence and the absence of controlled trials.
The update in 2015 of the new guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (compared with 2009) relates to the publication of a randomised study on the surgical treatment, the innovations in imaging procedures (especially functional imaging in nuclear medicine) and the new concept of «Team Endocarditis» (multidisciplinary approach).
Their aim is to remind the limitations of antibiotic prophylaxis and to insist on hospital hygiene measures.
Future challenges will be to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with the contamination of the valve and to optimize the adaptation of the current epidemiological prophylaxis.
In this first part, we will describe the preventive and diagnostic approaches of infective endocarditis.

Due to current migration flows, the practising obstetrician is likely to encounter parturient women carriers of female genital mutilations (FGM).
This article describes the obstetrical complications related to the latter.
We compared a group of mutilated patients (n = 69) to a control group (n = 162) and studied the data concerning pregnancy, childbirth, newborn, postpartum and length of hospital stay.
Among the mutilated patients, 44% were group B streptococcus carriers against 23 % in the control group (p inferior to 0.01).


Abstract
This concept begins to be recognized as a priority area for action at political level in Belgium.
Indeed, a limited HL may affect health by leading, for example, with poorer management of chronic diseases, more hospital admissions and premature deaths.
This paper addresses the question of HL evaluation, improvement interventions as well as the many challenges that remain in this area.
HL seems fundamental to the development of better health management.
It would allow patients to play a more active role in health care, to involve all health stakeholders, and to contribute to a more sustainable health system.
Improving HL could allow better equal access to health care.e.

Erythema nodosum is an acute nodular panniculitis, mainly affecting young women.


Abstract
At the end of 2008, a left colectomy clinical pathway was implemented at Clinique Saint-Joseph (CHC) in Liège (Belgium).
Although the hospital stay was not our primary objective, it decreased significantly from 8 to 4 days (average).


Abstract
It is established that the correlation between symptoms and intestinal lesions is weak.
Therefore, monitoring by frequent cross-sectional imaging is proposed to assess the disease activity.
Tomodensitometry will be reserved for emergency cases.
Ultrasonography can be useful, in emergency as well as for the monitoring of lesions of known topography.
Entero-MRI is henceforth considered the standard imaging technique for the diagnosis and follow-up of Crohn's disease.
Its high contrast resolution allows an accurate assessment of disease activity, therapeutic efficacy, cumulative structural bowel damage and complications.


Abstract
Esophageal cancer treatments are particularly complex and require a multidisciplinary approach.
Despite impressive advances in the tumour statidifaction, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the overall prognosis remains grim even at an early stage of the disease.


Abstract
Heart failure is a major public health problem in industrialized countries.
Its prognosis remains poor.
The new European recommendations for heart failure management allow validation of the latest advances in the field.
This article focuses on the definition, classification and treatment of chronic heart failure.
Indeed, there are new aspects to consider such as, a new classification, a new therapeutic class and new remote monitoring solutions.
On the contrary, there is no change in initial drug therapy, integration of the patient in a multidisciplinary program and the importance of treatment of comorbidities.


Abstract
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death in our country.
Exacerbations play a major role in the course of the disease.
Reducing the number of exacerbations in patients with COPD therefore represents a major challenge in the treatment of this disease.
In this article, we underline the importance of these exacerbations and review the therapeutic means available in 2017 to prevent them.


Abstract
The resting heart rate is not only a risk marker in heart failure, but it is also a risk factor, i.e., modifying heart rate also modifies the risk.
Chronotropic drugs have shown benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality.
Nevertheless, there is a major difference between the recommended heart rate and the patientsâ€™ everyday life heart rate.
Indeed, even if the proportion of heart failure patients on beta-blockers is satisfactory, the number of patients with an optimal heart rate remains insufficient.


Abstract
We tested, in the Province of Liege, an original approach that tends to individualize mass screening for breast cancer considering breast density and the notion of higher risk.
We compared the previous recommendations (January to June 2012) in the age ranges of 40-49 years (n = 1.730) and 70-74 years (n = 286) to the new recommendations (June 2012 - December 2014) in the age ranges of 40-49 years (n = 11.123) and 70-74 years (n = 2.008).
With the new recommendations, 38 % of women aged 40 to 49 years will benefit from a biennial invitation to screening due to a mainly greasy nature of their breasts (BI-RADS 1 and 2), while 11 % are classified BI-RADS 3 and 1 % BI-RADS 4 and are invited to perform an ultrasound to increase the screening sensitivity.
This individualized approach of mass screening is easily feasible from a practical viewpoint and the detection rate of breast cancers is increased.


Abstract
Tinnitus is a common reason for ENT consultation.
Patients who suffer from tinnitus are becoming more demanding and frequently ask questions about the cause, the mechanisms of onset, and the cure of their pathology.
The general practitioner, because of his proximity, must be involved in the prevention, diagnosis and information of individuals with tinnitus and, thus, fully fulfill his acting public health role.


Abstract
[Seizures in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus].
Among them, 14 (8 %) developed seizures before, at or after the SLE diagnosis.
The age of occurrence of seizures was younger than for other complications of the disease.
There was no significant association with the antiphospholipid syndrome.
Disease activity in these patients was significantly higher than in the control group.


Abstract
Cough is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical attention.
Chronic cough is defined when the symptom lasts for more than 8 weeks.
It significantly alters quality of life.
Chronic cough may be the dominant symptom which reveals a large number of diseases, not only respiratory.
It is classic to distinguish chronic cough according to the chest X Ray results.
It is, however, not rare that no clear aetiology can be found, thereby defining the concept of idiopathic refractory cough.
This paper describes the case of an asthma revealed by a persistent cough that responded well to treatment.
It also deals with the new pharmacological pathways that are tested in idiopathic refractory cough.


Abstract
The epidemiology, diagnostic criteria and advances in physiopathology of CRPS will be briefly described.

This presentation is pathognomonic of the cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.


Abstract
International guidelines have been edited to standardize asthma management.
A new approach named SIT (for Single Inhaler Therapy) or SMART (for Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) has demonstrated its safety and efficacy in numerous studies of adults with asthma summarized in two Cochrane reviews.
We present here three clinical cases from our clinic where this approach was applied to children and adolescents with a clear clinical and functional response for two of them.
Moreover asthma phenotypes have been described and it is possible that only some of these phenotypes respond to this regimen.
However to confirm the efficacy and safety of the SIT regimen in children and adolescents more studies are needed.


Abstract
Exposure to heavy metals is a common phenomenon due to their prevalence in food and environment; their toxicity remains a major concern for public health.
Chelating agents are drugs used to increase the elimination of metals present at abnormally high levels in the body.
Their approved clinical indications are limited, particularly because of their potential adverse effects.
Unfortunately, too often, chelating agents are used to test the body impregnation level by heavy metals.
It is an inappropriate and abusive use.
In order to attract attention to this problematic, the good and bad uses of metal chelators are reviewed.


Abstract
The syndrome of Familial Non Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (FNMTC) includes two or more patients with an isolated non-medullary thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, anaplastic) within the same family.
To diagnose FNMTC, the clinician must exclude a syndromic presentation such as the syndromes of Cowden, Gardner or Werner, and the Carney Complex.
Up to now, a hundred families with FNMTC have been genetically studied, including forms with (Ch19p13.2) or without oxyphilia (Ch2q21), in association with a multinodular goiter (Ch14q32), or with a renal cancer (Ch1q21).
Several candidate genes of susceptibility have been proposed: SRGAP1, NKX2-1, FOXE1 and HABP2.
Based on the literature and our experience of the follow-up of eight families with FNMTC, we discuss epidemiological, clinical, pathological and genetic aspects of FNMTC with a view to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.


Abstract
[New paradigms and metaphors in cutaneous melanoma treatment].
Unfortunately, the use of inflated descriptors of the drug efficacy leads to misunderstandings among the clinicians in charge of patients.
The recent therapeutic advance improves the median overall survival for a few months.
Some combined treatments could possibly boost the current beneficial effects.

Abstract
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is traditionally associated with polycythemia which results from chronic hypoxemia.
In this retrospective study, we investigated the prevalence of hemoglobin disorders in a cohort of 100 patients with stable, moderate to severe COPD (II to IV GOLD classification).
We identified 31 % patients with anemia while only 15 % had polycythemia.
Anemia was more frequent in male patients.
We also demonstrated a negative correlation between hemoglobin and CRP levels (R=-0.56, p inferior to 0.0001).
COPD patients with anemia had experienced a higher rate of hospitalizations for exacerbation in the previous year than those with polycythemia (p inferior to 0.05).
Anemia is a frequent comorbidity in COPD; it is associated with systemic inflammation and a propensity to hospitalization for exacerbation.


Abstract
Anorexia nervosa is a complex pathology that regularly leads clinicians to a therapeutic impasse.
The origin of this disorder is multifactorial.
It occurs most often in adolescence and affects mainly women.
Paradoxically, hunger is present but dissociated from adequate food function.
Somatic and psychological impact can be particularly heavy.
The treatment is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary care.
An eclectic and integrative approach, moving away from rigid therapeutic methods and integrating the plurality of techniques, seems to be particularly recommended to increase the chances of therapeutic success.
This article summarizes the various theoretical models of anorexia nervosa and its modalities of treatment.


Abstract
Aortic arch anomalies are relatively frequent and account for 15 to 20 % of all congenital cardiovascular malformations.
They can be discovered in case of symptoms of airway or esophageal compression such as dysphagia, chronic cough, stridor, wheezing and recurrent respiratory infections.
We report the cases of two children with encircling aortic arch anomaly.
The 3-year-old boy had complained of chronic respiratory symptoms such as laryngitis and asthma since the age of 4 months.
The 20-month-old boy presented with inter-mittent stridor, dysphagia and frequent vomiting.
In both patients, the cervico-thoracic CT-scan showed a right aortic arch with retro-esophageal left subclavian artery and Kommerell's diverticulum.

Topiramate (TPM) is a drug used in migraine prophylaxis.


Abstract
The high flow priapism (HFP) is a very rare pathology.
Conservative treatment is effective and remains the first line treatment.
However the different therapeutic modalities (selective embolisation, surgery) should be explained to the patient and be considered case by case.


Abstract
Edoxaban (Lixiana®) is a new oral anticoagulant that selectively inhibits Xa coagulation factor.
Edoxaban is prescribed at a dose of 60 mg once daily, which should be reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance between 15 and 50 ml/min), a body weight below or equal 60 kg and/or a concomitant therapy with some strong P-glycoprotein inhibitors.
Lixiana® is reimbursed for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolic disease as well as in patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation and the presence of at least another risk factor.


Abstract
It's a rare pathology involving a high risk of diagnostic errors.

Abstract
Studies in pediatric oncology describe a relative good quality of life in child cancer survivor.
However, few studies were interested in the parents of a child cancer survivor.
61 parents are recruited in the Belgian hospitals.
Three groups of parents are constituted : the parents whose child is in 4 years of survivorship (group 1), in 5 years of survivorship (group 2) and in 6 years of survivorship (group 3).
Clinical scales and a Stroop emotion task are administered.
Parents (of the 3 groups) present a low tolerance of uncertainty, have excessive worries about the evolution of the health of their child, and suffer from anxious symptoms.
The Stroop emotion tasks reveals a cognitive bias of the attention in favour of threatening stimuli.
The study highlights the importance to detect parents who are intolerant of uncertainty at the cancer diagnosis stage and their continuous psychological follow-up once the treatments are ended.


Abstract
The severity of the carcinomas is due to their multiplicity and to the progressive occurrence of more aggressive lesions.
Prevention relies on a strict adherence to sun protection after transplantation and on refined immunosuppressive strategies.

Abstract
Because of the natural history of type 2 diabetes and the increasing life expectancy, more and more patients are treated with insulin after failure of oral therapy.


Abstract
Virus nucleic acids and antibody response to pathogens can be measured using swine oral fluids (OFs).
Detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome in swine OFs has previously been demonstrated.
Virus isolation and viral antigen detection are additional confirmatory assays for diagnosing FMDV, but these methods have not been evaluated using swine OF.
The objectives of this study were to further validate the molecular detection of FMDV in oral fluids, evaluate antigen detection and FMDV isolation from swine OFs, and develop an assay for isotypic anti-FMDV antibody detection in OFs.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) from FMDV was detected in OFs from experimentally infected pigs by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from 1 day post-infection (dpi) to 21 dpi.
Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was isolated from OFs at 1 to 5 dpi.
Additionally, FMDV antigens were detected in OFs from 1 to 6 dpi using a lateral flow immunochromatographic strip test (LFIST), which is a rapid pen-side test, and from 2 to 3 dpi using a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS ELISA).
Furthermore, FMDV-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) was detected in OFs using an isotype-specific indirect ELISA starting at dpi 14.


Abstract
In May of 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was detected in swine for the first time in North America.
It spread rapidly, in part due to contaminated livestock trailers.
The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in the presence of feces on metal surfaces, such as those found in livestock trailers.
Three-week-old barrows were inoculated intragastrically with 5 mL of PEDV-negative feces for the negative control, 5 mL of untreated PEDV-positive feces for the positive control, and 5 mL or 10 mL of PEDV-positive feces that was subjected to treatment with a 1:16 or 1:32 concentrations of accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for a contact time of 30 min at 20°C. These pigs served as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of virus following treatment.


Abstract
The boars tolerated well concurrent administration of 2 commercial PRRSV vaccines, and no adverse reactions were observed.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine the effect of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on the density of nitrergic nerve fibers in the mucosal layer of different sections of the gastrointestinal tract of dogs.
Twenty-eight German shepherd hybrid dogs of both sexes, weighing from 15 to 25 kg and aged 6 to 10 y, were studied.
The dogs were divided into 4 groups with 7 animals in each group: healthy animals, as well as dogs suffering from mild, moderate, and severe IBD.
Immunoreactivity to neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase, which is a marker of nitrergic neurons, in samples of the mucosal layer in the duodenum, jejunum, and descending colon was studied using the single immunofluorescence method and the number of nerve fibers was evaluated in each observation field.
The obtained results showed that IBD causes an increase in the number of nitrergic nerve fibers in all intestinal segments studied and these changes are directly proportional to the intensity of the disease process.
These observations may be useful in diagnostic evaluation of the stage of canine inflammatory bowel disease in veterinary practice.
The pathological mechanisms of these observed changes and the specific reasons for them are still not completely explained, however, and further study is required.


Abstract
This commentary explores the importance of considering the biopsychosocial model and contextual factors when prescribing exercise.
Diverse exercise programs for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) produce similar outcomes, without one specific exercise protocol demonstrating clear superiority.
One clear barrier to positive outcomes is poor exercise adherence.


Abstract
Male infertility is a devastating problem that affects many couples worldwide.
However, the molecular mechanisms and causes of idiopathic male infertility remain unclear.


Abstract
Tissue expansion using implantable expanders is a useful means of generating surplus tissue for reconstruction of defects such as scarring following burns.
The authors describe their technique of incisions distant to the desired location of expander placement, and remote dissection of the expander pocket with hydrodissection and blunt forceps.
A total of 81 expanders were placed in 30 consecutive patients, 81% of whom had burn scars due for reconstruction.
During preparation, no complications, such as bleeding, were encountered, except one case with severe subdermal fibrosis, in which bleeding was stopped through brief application of pressure.
One patient experienced hematoma formation that resolved spontaneously, and one instance of expander extrusion and subsequent removal occurred.
Receiving ≥2 expanders at the same time was statistically associated with higher risk for complication(s).
The authors' complication rates were moderate and comparable with open or endoscopic approaches.
Time of expansion is reduced compared with the open approach due to distant incision placement and immediate usability.
Cost effectiveness appeared to be better using only inexpensive forceps, rather than elaborate and costly endoscopic equipment.


Abstract
In recent years, the treatment of esophagus cancer has been completely changed, thus competing the dogma of surgery as the cornerstone treatment.
Multimodality treatments as radio-chemotherapy directly followed by surgery, or delayed surgery, significantly improve patient survival compared to surgery alone.
Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is associated with a higher complete pathologic response rate and improved survival compared to chemotherapy alone.

Abstract
In Belgium, epidemiological data are rare, and most often extrapolated, for burn injuries, especially in the pediatrician population.
The purpose of this study was to obtain data for the pediatrician population in Liege.
Overall 844 patients (379 girls, 465 boys) were included for the first part of this study (burns localization and etiology, sex ratio, age), with a mean age of 4.2 years old.
Over this five years period, the number of pediatrician patients admitted increased by 47 %.
The most frequent burn site was the hand (32.8 %) and the burn cause was scalds (49.4 %).
For the second part of the study (hospitalisation and treatment duration, hypertrophic scars), 712 patients were included (321 girls and 391 boys).
Hypertrophic scars were found in 9.27 %.
Our results show that burn injury is more often found in boys, and this injury occurs mostly in children under 5 years of age.


Abstract
There are two methods of abortion : the medical and the surgical methods, each with its own specific benefits.
Theoretically, the limit of medical abortion gestational age is 7 weeks of amenorrhea.
The purpose is to investigate the efficiency of the medical approach up to 9 weeks and to assess the drug dose required according to the term of pregnancy.
However, maintaining this level of efficiency during the progress of pregnancy requires an increase of the administered doses of misoprostol.
In addition, there is a significant increase in the use of analgesics.
The medical abortion procedure remains effective until 9 weeks of gestation.
This pharmacological approach reduces the risks induced, in the short and long term by the surgical procedure.


Abstract
Nowadays, nearly one out of six teenagers is concerned.
More and more publicized, this practice may disturb.
However, it reflects an underlying state of psychic suffering and should not be underestimated or dramatized.


Abstract
The analgesia produced by parietal infiltrations with local anesthetics (ALs) results from a block of conduction and the anti-inflammatory effect of the ALs.
The duration of the reported analgesia is variable : limited to the duration of action of the ALs, or sometimes very prolonged.
The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, study is to investigate the duration of the analgesia of a parietal infiltration after caesarian.


Abstract
It appears that echography gives excellent results.


Abstract
Conversion disorder is a psychiatric disorder often encountered in neurology services.
This condition without organic lesions was and still is sometimes referred as an imaginary illness or feigning.
However, the absence of organic lesions does not exclude the possibility of cerebral dysfunction.
The etiologic mechanisms underlying this disorder remain uncertain even today.
The advent of cognitive and functional imaging opens up a field of exploration for psychiatry in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying mental disorders and especially the conversion disorder.
This article reports several neuroimaging studies of conversion disorder and attempts to generate hypotheses about neurobiological mechanisms.


Abstract
Milk samples from 152 quarters were collected on 2 Swiss dairy farms equipped with automatic milking systems.
Correlations and regressions among SCC, LHD, and IgG were calculated after grouping by the pathogen type (control, S. aureus, C. bovis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and S. uberis).
All the mastitis causing pathogens were gram-positive bacteria (except for 3 cases with E. coli).
All studied variables were positively correlated among each other.
SCC and LDH were the highest correlated parameters in the control, S. aureus, C. bovis and coagulase- negative Staphylococcus groups.
Only in the S. uberis group the correlation between LDH and IgG was higher than the correlation between SCC and LDH.
The regression coefficients for SCC and LDH differed between groups whereas regression coefficients for SCC and IgG, and for LDH and IgG were similar in all groups.
Because cases with E. coli infection were so rare, we could not include these cases in the statistical evaluation.
This study shows that the suitability of LDH as a marker for IgG transfer is dependent on the pathogen.
The use of LDH in combination with SCC may be used as a marker to differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but does not allow differentiating the immune response between different gram-positive bacteria.


Abstract
Two flocks of ewes with lambs were compared for differences in performance.
The lambs were slaughtered with 43 kg.
In 20 lambs of each group the lying behaviour was measured using a datalogger during 5 consecutive days.


Abstract
Improving water and sanitation is the preferred choice for cholera control in the long-term.
Nevertheless, vaccination is an available tool that has been shown to be a cost-effective option for cholera prevention in endemic countries or during outbreaks.
In 2011 the first low-cost oral cholera vaccine for international use was given prequalification by the World Health Organization (WHO).
To increase and prioritize use of the vaccine, WHO created a global stockpile in 2013 from which countries may request oral cholera vaccine for reactive campaigns.
WHO has issued specific guidelines for applying for the vaccine, which was previously in short supply (despite prequalification for a second oral vaccine in 2015).
The addition of a third WHO-prequalified oral cholera vaccine in 2016 is expected to increase the global stockpile considerably and alleviate supply issues.
However, prioritization and best use of the vaccine (e.g. how, when and where to use) will remain challenges.
We describe 12 past oral cholera vaccine campaigns, conducted in settings with varying burdens of cholera.
These case studies illustrate three key challenges faced in the use of the oral cholera vaccines: regulatory hurdles, cold chain logistics and vaccine coverage and uptake.
To pave the way for the introduction of current and future oral cholera vaccines, we discuss operational challenges and make recommendations for future research with respect to each of these challenges.


Abstract
Malawi is the world's largest producer of burley tobacco and its population is affected by the negative consequences of both tobacco consumption and production.
In countries like Malawi, tobacco control refers to control of the tobacco supply chain, rather than control of consumption.
We review the impact of tobacco cultivation, using Malawi as an example, to illustrate the economic, environmental, health and social issues faced by low- and middle-income countries that still produce significant tobacco crops.
We place these issues in the context of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly 3a which calls on all governments to strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
Other goals address the negative effects that tobacco cultivation has on development.
The SDGs offer an opportunity for low- and middle-income countries that are dependent on tobacco production and that are not yet parties to the Convention, to reconsider joining the FCTC.


Abstract
Existing definitions and measurement approaches of quality of health care often fail to address the complexities involved in understanding quality of care.
It is perceptions of quality, rather than clinical indicators of quality, that drive service utilization and are essential to increasing demand.
Within the communities and societies where care is provided, quality of care cannot be understood outside social norms, relationships, trust and values.
We need to improve not only technical quality but also acceptability, responsiveness and levels of patient-provider trust.
Measurement approaches need to be reconsidered.
An improved understanding of all the attributes of quality in health systems and their interrelationships could support the expansion of access to essential health interventions.


Abstract
Situational analysis: regional review of the substance use Atlas 2015.
The Atlas project on substance use is a global WHO project that aims to collect and disseminate data on resources for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders.
Information on resources available in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region was first published in 2012.
The Atlas questionnaire was updated in 2014 and data were collected in all WHO Member States.
All countries of the Region submitted the Atlas questionnaire.
This report presents the latest key information on resources for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean Region based on the responses of the countries to the questionnaire.
Current estimates show that the burden attributable to drug use disorders in the Region is high.
Health system resources for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders vary across countries, but are generally still insufficient to provide adequate care and treatment for people with these disorders.
Countries need to strengthen prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, particularly by increasing coverage of treatment interventions.


Abstract
International drug control system and the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on the world drug problem: an overview.
The international drug control system is one of the oldest consensus-based multilateral systems in existence.
It provides the basis for the international community and the individual Member States to effectively put in place the mechanisms to address the problem of drug production trafficking and use of illicit substances at different levels.
Currently, the international drug control conventions enjoy near universal adherence, with over 180 states party to the three international drug control conventions.
This level of consensus is impressive given the highly contentious nature of the subject matter.


Abstract
Out-of-pocket cost of drug abuse consequences: results from Iranian National Mental Health Survey.
Drug abuse has significant cost to the individual, the family and the society.
This study aimed to assess out of-pocket costs of consequences of drug use disorder.
Data were drawn from the Iranian Mental Health Survey (IranMHS) through face-to-face interviews with 7841 respondents aged 15-64 years.
We used a bottom-up cost-ofillness method for economic analysis.
Out-of-pocket costs for treatment of mental and drug problems, treatment of medical illnesses, as well as costs of crimes were assessed.
The average of total annual expense was US$ 2120.6 for those with drug use disorder, which was 23.5% of annual income of an average Iranian family in the year 2011.
The average of total out-of-pocket cost was US$ 674.6 for those with other mental disorder and US$ 421.9 for those with no mental disorder.
Catastrophic payment was reported in 47.6% of the patients with drug use disorder and 14.4% of those with other mental disorder.
Thus, considerable amount of family resources are spent on the consequences of drug use.


Abstract
Level of khat dependence, use patterns, and psychosocial correlates in Yemen: a cross-sectional investigation.
Chronic khat use is associated with negative health consequences.
However, no study has fully characterized individuals who are khat dependent.
This paper examines socio-demographic and psychosocial correlates of adult khat dependence.
A total of 270 khat users (129 women) in Yemen completed face-to-face interviews and provided demographic information and data on patterns of khat use, subjective mood, and sleep quality.
The Severity of Dependence Scale-Khat (SDS-khat) was used to assess level of khat dependence.
A series of analysis of variance was conducted.
Khat users, on average, used khat for 5.2 hours a day (SD = 2.3) for 5.7 days a week (SD = 2.0).
Individuals who screened positive for khat dependence reported longer duration of khat sessions per day, higher frequency of khat use per week, greater levels of negative mood and sleep disturbances, and were more likely to endorse physical symptoms after khat use (P < 0.05).
Future research should elucidate mechanisms responsible for khat dependence symptomatology.


Abstract
Pattern of addiction and its relapse among habitual drug abusers in Lahore, Pakistan.
This study assessed the pattern of drug abuse and the reasons for relapse of addiction among male drug addicts seeking rehabilitative services in different centres in Lahore, Pakistan.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted on male drug abusers from April to December 2016.
Nonprobability purposive sampling was done to collect a sample of 119 participants.
A structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews were used for data collection.
Out of 119 participants, 71.4% were in the age group 15-35 years.
Educational levels were low in the majority, with 68.1% below secondary education.
Unmarried (51.3%) and unemployed (44.5%) participants were at the greatest risk of using drugs.
The age of addiction in 45% of patients was < 18 years and 40% had been abusing substances for > 5 years.
Reasons for starting drug abuse were recreation (37%), curiosity (34.5%), and lifechanging events (14.3%).
Reasons for relapse included association with former addicts, negative reactions from family, inability to manage the craving and work/social stress.


Abstract
Drop-out from a drug treatment clinic and associated reasons.
The aim of this study was to assess drop-out rates and associated reasons among patients at the Iranian National Center for Addiction Studies (IN
CAS
) clinic.
In a one-year period (April 2014 to March 2015), all patients with drug dependence who had been referred for treatment and attended for a first assessment were included in this study (N=242).
Those who received treatment were followed until March 2016.
Survival analysis showed that 70.2% had dropped out from treatment.
Drop-out rates within the first three months was 62% (SE= 0.05) and 82.4% (SE=0.03) for opioids and stimulants dependence, respectively.
Analyses were performed using SPSS (Version 21.0) and STATA software, (version 13.0).
From the patients' perspective, motivational inconsistencies were considered as the main reason for not starting or leaving treatment.
The findings of this study could give service providers a better grasp of drop-out rates and the associated reasons.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to measure the performance of the National Rehabilitation Center (NRC) programme and the services it provides.
A 6-point tool was developed based on international standards with appropriate performance measures.
The elements of the tool were applied to the electronic data files for 2013.
The results showed that there were some operational, quality and data system issues.
There was a high no-show rate for appointments (46%) and readmission rate (52%) and most families did not attend family sessions (72%).
This was a valuable exercise which identified gaps in operations and records.
The findings were shared with the different teams to help improve the quality of data and services and the tool will be used for annual performance evaluations.


Abstract
Prevalence, determinants and impacts of khat chewing among professional drivers in Southwestern Saudi Arabia.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of khat chewing, and explore its social, economic and work impacts and examine its relation with road traffic accidents (RTA) among professional drivers in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 215 drivers recruited from transport stations in Jazan region by random cluster sampling.
An interview questionnaire was utilized for data collection, and 47.4% of drivers were currently khat chewers.
Khat chewing was significantly associated with shorter working hours; higher average number of significant RTA, and higher frequency of traffic violation.
In conclusion, khat chewing habit affected almost half of the professional drivers in Jazan area.
Moreover, khat chewing was associated with impaired working ability and productivity, family conflicts, and violation of traffic rules.


Abstract
Substance use prevention: evidence-based intervention.
The global substance use problem is a serious public health concern that affects not only health, safety and well-being of communities, but also social and economic development.
It particularly affects children, young people and their families.
All Member States should set substance use prevention measures and programmes as a priority in order to promote health and reduce social harm.
During the past few decades there has been a significant advance in prevention science that has led to the development of international prevention standards and globally accepted evidence-based interventions.
This review looks into the key requirements, components and strategic interventions needed for a public health approach to prevention of substance use and disorders, and its health and social consequences.
It aims at supporting Member States and civil society to identify the key elements that support countries and local communities to increase the number of substance use protective approaches in relation to risk factors across all relevant domains.

for the management of substance use disorders: an overview.
For the past 50 years, there has been a systematic effort to expand and improve treatment services for individuals with substance use disorders by developing an evidence base to guide practice.
In the development of this policy brief, numerous documents were reviewed.
The recommendations within this policy brief incorporate the core recommendations on substance use disorder elements included in the mhGAP intervention guide.


Abstract
Public health alternatives to incarceration for drug offenders.
Drug users are vastly overrepresented in prison populations.
Once inside they face increased risks of acquiring infections such as HIV, hepatitis and TB, and on release they face an elevated risk of fatal overdose.
Relapse and recidivism are the norm following release from prison.
The implementation of evidence-based drug treatment programmes in prison is rare, yet drug treatment in prison reduces the transmission of infections, recidivism and fatal overdose on release.
Women with drug problems are twice as likely to have been imprisoned for a drug offence as incarcerated men.
Similarly, HIV prevalence is higher among female inmates.
Serious attention should be paid to implementation of non-custodial sentences for women, particularly during pregnancy and those with young children.

Abstract
Use of amphetamine-type stimulants in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2004-2015: a review.
Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are the second most commonly used illicit drugs in the world, after cannabis.
The production of ATS has increased worldwide, including in the Middle East.
This review aims to assess ATS use in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
PubMed, Scientific Information Database (a national database) and Iranian Center for Addiction Studies were searched.
The review included studies on the general population, university and high school students, other specific populations, and drug users.
The result show that self-reported methamphetamine and ecstasy use in 2016 was < 1% in the general population and university and high-school students, but the prevalence was higher in certain groups.
There has also been an increase in the proportion of ATS users among clients of drug treatment centres.
The findings highlight the need for high quality epidemiological studies and closer monitoring of stimulant use in different populations.

Abstract
Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection is rare but important to recognize because of the major risk of sequelae or death.
The diagnosis is mainly based on specific clinical and biological analyses.
Aciclovir is the treatment of choice, duration of administration depending on the severity of the disease.
A six-month treatment with suppressive-dose oral aciclovir is recommended to improve the child's prognosis.
From a clinical case, we reviewed the literature to improve the management.


Abstract
Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare pustular and ulcerative inflammatory disease belonging to the group of neutrophilic dermatoses.
It is frequently associated with systemic immune diseases.
In this context the PG can be exceptionally triggered by tissue trauma such as surgery (pathergy).
We report the case of a patient with stabilized rheumatoid arthritis who developed aggressive and disseminated PG at all surgical wounds following an abdominal dermolipectomy associated with breast pexy.
Systemic corticosteroid methylprednisolone allowed a rapid control of skin ulcerations.
In the aftermath of an intervention, PG is often confused with a bacterial skin-necrotizing panniculitis.
The recognition of the inflammatory nature of cutaneous symptoms is crucial to quickly start an immunosuppressive treatment and limit scarring sequelae.
Our case also illustrates the need to consider any history of dysimmune inflammatory or oncohematological disease as a risk factor before surgery, even if the latter are stabilized.


Abstract
The occurrence of an unexpected sudden death puts the witnesses of this event in a situation of high emotional impact.
However, little data exist on the emotional impact of a cardio-respiratory arrest outside the hospital on the witness, who is often a close family member.
Resuscitation by a person not belonging to the medical corps seems not to be devoid of psychological impact.
Indeed, the presence of psychological distress is observed for most of witnesses questioned 6 to 10 days after the call but also 3 months later.
This work highlights therefore the importance of identifying the coping strategies involved, in order to promote potentially beneficial strategies and limit the trauma associated with this type of event.

Abstract
Burnout or professional fatigue syndrome has never been more talked about than in recent times.
It is the result of exposure to a situation in which the strategies of the subject who are supposed to manage the stresses of the environment become outdated and inoperative.
An imbalance is created between the demands and the material, operational and psychological resources to cope with them.
Many health professions are confronted with the challenge of managing burnout.
Among them, the general practitioner is very often on the front line.
This paper is dedicated to him in priority.
In its first part, it deals successively with the classification of the pathology (ICD-10 and DSM-5), its prevalence, its socio-economic impacts, its clinical picture (three stages), its diagnosis (by clinic and questionnaires), its causes, its evolution (from denial to acceptance), and its long-term consequences in the absence of treatment.

Abstract
In patients suffering from systemic arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, or heart failure, beta-blockers and angiotensin-convertase enzyme inhibitors play a major therapeutic and preventive role.
Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of mortality in industrialized countries.
Unless adapted preventive strategy, notably pharmacological interventions, cardiovascular events in these patients remain high.
One reason for this relative failure is represented by non-adherence to treatment.
A treatment consisting in an association in one pill of several different molecules should confer a higher treatment compliance and thus efficacy.
This article describes the characteristics of the first available dual association between a cardioselective beta-blocker agent, bisoprolol, and an angiotensin-convertase enzyme inhibitor, perindopril arginine.


Abstract
The latter can provoke an acute renal failure, which may lead to a toxic accumulation of these pharmacological agents and/or increase their nephrotoxicity.
This may induce a vicious circle that is potentially dangerous and even fatal.
For each of them, the pathophysiology of the complication will be briefly discussed.
Some patient risk profiles where caution is mandatory will be also emphasized.

Abstract
The incidence of awareness seems to be higher in children than in adults, although in this population, the causes and consequences of awareness remain difficult to define.
Compared to adults, there are less psychological effects and complications after awareness and no PTSD has been declared in children.
The revival of interest concerning awareness has been stimulated by the availability of new technologies to assess the depth of anesthesia.
These monitoring seem to be more accurate in children older than 1 year.

Abstract
Fine needle aspiration cytology was suspicious of papillary thyroid cancer.
A decision to perform a total thyroidectomy (TT) and central compartment neck dissection was made.
Final histological analysis showed no disease within the thyroid gland or in the neck nodes.
The presence of cancer suspected within the TGDC by relevant diagnostic modalities may necessitate treatment to the thyroid gland and neck in addition to a Sistrunk's procedure as part of a definitive treatment policy due to the high incidence of associated thyroid malignancy.

Abstract
Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and include different diagnoses associated with a different prognosis.
Histology remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of these tumors.
However, pathologists may encounter diagnostic difficulties due to tumor heterogeneity or to the small size of the samples.
Recently, major advances in discovery of molecular alterations of these cancers have led to the development of new molecular markers, some with a diagnostic role, others with a prognostic impact and / or predictive of therapeutic response.


Abstract
The objective of this paper is to review the literature published in 2013 and 2014 in the field of intensive care and emergency related to oncology.


Abstract
We present three cases of anterior dislocation of the radial head associated with plastic deformation of the ulna in children.
It is a Monteggia equivalent lesion type 1 according to the Bado's classification.
Radiological diagnosis often goes unnoticed to the untrained eye.
The relationship between the radius and the capitulum identifies the dislocated radial head on radiographs AP or lateral.
Line Mubarak highlights the bowing of the ulna on radiographs lateral.
Evolution is pejorative in the absence of early orthopedic care.
Older is the patient and longer is the time between injury and treatment, less good are the clinical and radiological results.
The first line treatment is closed reduction of the dislocation of the radial head and the bowing of the ulna.
Surgical treatment is indicated in cases of failure of closed reduction.
Adequate surgical treatment is that which allows and maintain the reduction.
Open reduction can be associated with various surgical techniques: the annular ligament plasty, the establishment of a transitory pin intra-articular capitulo radiale, the ulna osteotomy, the radial osteotomy.
Radial head resection is not indicated in children.

Abstract
Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare infection (0,2 to 0,4/100,000 adults) of the dermis and hypodermis extending along muscular fascia1.
The absence of pathognomonic symptoms makes its diagnosis difficult.
Rapidly progressive, it is a life-threatening emergency whose prognosis is letal in 30 % of cases.
Treatment of necrotizing fasciitis is mixed and involves aggressive surgical debridement and medical treatment with antibiotics and supportive agents.
This article is presenting the case of a young woman who developed abdominal necrotizing fasciitis following a caesarean section.
In forty-eight hours, the patient developed septic shock with an extensive and rapid destruction of her abdominal wall.
After hysterectomy and multiple surgical debridements, evolution was favorable.
After one month, a reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed.


Abstract
Epidemiology, potential complications and treatment will be discussed.


Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects 3 to 17 % of adults.
As well as in MDD, molecular, neuro-anatomical and metabolic disturbances are involved in TRD.
A decreased cerebral plasticity induced by low level of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is also reported.
In contrast to MDD treatment, TRD treatment is most often physical treatment.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) followed by a tricyclic antidepressant and/or lithium is the most effective treatment.
Deep brain stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation reach also a high rate of remission but they are both very invasive technique.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in TRD seems to be effective in TRD but lower than ECT.
There are two majors purposes for this review.
First it may help the clinician to understand the TRD's complexity and also it details the kind of treatment useful to care it.

Abstract
Serous cystadenomas of pancreas are unusual cystic tumour.
The microcystic forms is more common and its radiological diagnosis is easy.
However, the macrocystic unilocular form of serous cystadenoma can be mistaken with other malignant macrocystic lesions of the pancreas.
We report the case of a 17 year-old girl, admitted to the National Hospital of Niamey (Niger), with abdominal pain and an unilocular macrocystic serous cystadenoma of pancreas, diagnosed after histological examination of the surgical specimen.
The diagnostic tests, including ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, endoscopic ultrasonography are inconclusive.
Challenge of its management is related to the preoperative diagnosis.

Abstract
Chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure are two common diseases that mutually maintain during their evolution.
In the advanced stages of chronic kidney disease, most pat ients are hypertensive and show signs of vascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular or peripheral).
Almost one third of the patients with advanced chronic kidney disease exhibit resistant hypertension that requires complex therapeutic management.
In chronic kidney disease, antihypertensive treatment is conditioned by comorbidities, but also by proteinuria, which is an independent cardiovascular risk factor in addition to the rate of glomerular filtration rate.
The treatment of high blood pressure is a cornerstone of the management of the chronic kidney disease.
It limits the risk of cardiovascular events (eg. myocardial infarction, stroke), but also slows the progression of chronic kidney disease.
Various recommendations have been recently published on the subject in order to offer assistance to the therapeutic management of hypertension in the patient suffering from chronic kidney disease.
The purpose of this article is to highlight these main key elements.

Abstract
The incidence of skin cancer cases has increased significantly during the last decades.
This term refers to 2 major types of skin cancer : basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Actinic keratosis is a premalignant condition that may evolve into SCC.
Fortunately, skin cancer is amenable to early detection and potential cure.
General practitioners may play a very important role in the timely diagnosis and management of these tumors.
They are on the front line to detect NMSC : opportune examination coupled with good observation skills allow a high detection rate of suspicious lesions.
It is essential to identify the high-risk patient as well as the clinical signs of suspicious lesions.
This article outlines the clinical features of common NMSC and highlights which lesions should be best referred to a dermatologist.

Abstract
In Belgium, poor sleep complaints are numerous and frequent in the general population.
Of these complaints, one of the most important is insomnia.
Acute onset and chronicity of insomnia can be explained by different models based on genetic criteria, neurophysiological, neuroendocrine, neuroimmunological and neuroimaging.
Insomnia can be associated with a lot of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities.
The diagnosis of insomnia is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on medical history and physical examination.
Different tools can help us in our approach, such as self-questionnaires and sleep diaries while additional tests (polysomnography and actigraphy) should be reserved for research of associated sleep disorders and for unclear situations.
The management of insomnia can be non-drug treatment (exercise, light therapy, acupuncture and self-treatment cognitive behavioral therapy) but also drug treatment (benzodiazepine, Z-DRUGS, melatonin, antidepressants, herbal medicines, neuroleptics and antihistaminics).
Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered when choosing treatment.
The aim of this review is to allow general practitioners to better understand the mechanisms of insomnia and to have recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia.

Abstract
Vaccination of pregnant women is designed to protect the mother and the fetus from preventable diseases through vaccination.
Authorized vaccines contain inactivated viruses, otherwise (l ive virus), they cannot be made during pregnancy.
Vaccines offered in all circumstances are those against influenza, at any point in pregnancy, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, in the 3rd trimester.
Hepatitis A and/or B, meningitis, pneumococcal, rabies, anthrax vaccines must be considered in post exposure.
Vaccines to be done at distance of pregnancy are those against chickenpox, rubella, measles and mumps for unprotected women, as well as the vaccine against HPV, BCG, yellow fever and smallpox.
In conclusion, only influenza vaccines and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis showed a safe profile during pregnancy.

Vulvo-vaginal infections are frequently encountered by gynecologists and general practitioners.


Abstract
Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is a major public health problem.
It is estimated that 15 to 35 % of infected patients will develop cirrhosis after a period of 30 years.
This indicates viral eradication.
Treatment of chronic hepatitis C is a real revolution.
New therapies consist in direct acting antivirals.
These treatments offer high chance of viral eradication (> 90 %), and are very well tolerated.
Hepatitis C viral elimination is possible in the next 15 years at a population level in Belgium, but this implies a significant improvement in screening and access to therapy.

Abstract
The most frequent etiologies of AP are gallstone(s) and alcohol abuse.
The early management of AP includes in all cases, fluid resuscitation, pain control and transient fasting.
In biliary AP, endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy should be performed only if associated cholangitis.
In infected organized necrosis with clinical deterioration despite conservative treatment, an invasive treatment (step-upapproach by drainage ± necrosectomy) could be proposed.
Surgery, either by pancreaticojejunostomy or resection remains indicated for 20 - 25 % of patients.
The management of complications from CP (biliary stricture, pseudocyst) is also important as well as the treatment of diabetes and steatorrhea in order to avoid denutrition.

Outbreak of CA-MRSA infections must be reported to the health inspector.


Abstract
Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are the most common atypical pathogens seen in respiratory infections in children.
The clinical features are hardly specific ; it appears that M. pneumoniae respiratory infect ions are associated with chest pain and the absence of wheezing, however, further confirmations are needed.
Hoarseness is frequently seen with C. pneumoniae infection.
Co-infections with viruses, bacteria or even between M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae can be frequent.
Infection with either of these bacteria seems to increase the incidence of asthma.
Serodiagnosis can be helpful.
Macrolides are the classical antibiotics used for treatment of these pathogens.
Resistance to macrolides in M. pneumoniae treatment has been described.
In conclusion, there is still a lack in scientific literature of high level evidences and clear consensus in the management of suspicious infection due to M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae.


Abstract
Despite advances in the management of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease remains a major concern.
They showed first the cardiovascular neutrality of gliptins, a result not really surprising for a median follow-up of less than 3 years.

Abstract
The status of the human embryo has always be a subject of philosophical and theological thoughts with major social consequences, but, until the 19th century, it has been mainly an abstraction.
The arrival of the human embryo in vitro, materialized by Louise Brown's birth in 1978 and above all by the supernumerary embryos produced by the Australian team of Trounson and Wood following the introduction of ovarian stimulation, will turn theoretical thoughts into a reality.
This does not preclude the collectivity right and legitimacy to give a precise status and it is remarkable to observe the law is careful not to specify which status to give to the human embryo.
It is more thru handling procedures and functioning rules that the law designed the embryo position, neither with a status of a person, nor of a thing.


Abstract
Since the 2nd half of the 20th century, the contraception, the ultrasound, the medically assisted procreation, the notions of desired pregnancies or invaluable pregnancies modified our glance to the fetus.
The prenatal diagnosis allowed anticipating dramatic situations which previously arose at birth or afterwards.
The professionals of the perinatal medicine wonder about the care of this particular mourning.
Every stage of this difficult process for the parents since the announcement of an anomaly to the fetus, the prognosis evaluation, the decision-making then its realization is decoded.
This necessarily multidisciplinary practice brought closer the professionals of the birth.
The answer to be given to these requests requires remaining vigilant in order not to modify the legal status of the embryo or the fetus and not to call into question the legitimacy of the termination of pregnancy.


Abstract
Biological effects of static magnetic fields (MF) and time-varying MF of electricity (50/60 Hz) appear possible from intensities in the low illitesla range.
However, prolonged exposure to 50/60 Hz MF is associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia at less than one microtesla of time-averaged intensity.
And such kind of association is suggested in adults for some blood cancers and senile dementia.
The cryptochrome hypothesis has been proposed to explain the association established with childhood leukemia.
Cryptochromes indeed assume the regulation of circadian biorhythms (a disruption of these lasts takes part to carcinogenesis) and they could be intrinsically sensitive to MF as from the low microtesla range.
The cryptochrome hypothesis is now supported by diverse experimental observations.
And recently, its relevance is further enhanced by the perspective of possible photo-dependence of the clock function of Cry 2 in retina, at least in diurnal mammals - the magnetic sensitivity of cryptochromes is indeed photo-dependent.
Such a perspective however implies some major paradigm shifts in the experimental study of biological effects of 50/60 Hz MF as it has been conducted to date.
On the other hand, the cryptochrome hypothesis can in principle also apply to static MF.
For these, indeed, a mechanism of interaction with cryptochromes is identified, which is not the case of 50/60 Hz MF so far.
A hypothesis is proposed here for these last, namely, resonance-based interaction with the spin polarization of one or both the radicals of the long-lived (milliseconds) pair FAD°-Trp4°.


Abstract
Cannabis is a widely spread drug which chronic abuse may cause diverse adverse effects on the body, in the short and long term.
Among these effects, we can cite digestive disorders, mainly characterized by the onset of cyclical vomiting illness.
Vomiting symptoms can be temporarily relieved by hot water showers.
Multiple investigations and hospitalizations did not determine a precise diagnosis explaining the symptomatology.
The final diagnosis is the vomiting syndrome caused by the consumption of cannabis.

Abstract
Either in vivo or in vitro, the sperm initiates a series of irreversible biochemical and physiological modifications in the oocyte.
The earliest detected signal after fertilization is cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, a prerequisite step for embryo development.
These oscillations trigger the release of the oocyte from the second meiosis arrest towards embryogenesis, also known as "oocyte activation".
Phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ) is a unique sperm-soluble protein responsible for triggering the InsP3/Ca2+ pathway within the oocyte, leading to Ca2+ oscillations and consequently to embryo development.
The specific structure of PLCζ (compared to other PLCs) enables its specialized activity via the preserved X and Y catalytic domains, as well as distinct features such as rapid onset, high sensitivity to Ca2+ and cession of oscillations upon zygote formation.
The emerging discoveries of PLCζ have stimulated studies focusing on the possible clinical applications of this protein in male infertility evaluation and management during IVF/ICSI.
Fertilization failure is attributed to lack of oocyte second meiosis resumption, suggesting that ICSI failure may be related to impaired PLCζ activity.
Microinjection of recombinant human PLCζ to human oocytes after ICSI fertilization failure may trigger Ca2+ oscillations and achieve successful fertilization, offering new hope for couples traditionally referred to sperm donation.
However, more studies are still required prior to the routine implementation of this approach in the clinic.
Directions for future studies are discussed.

Abstract
Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic, and its prevalence has been projected to grow by 40% in the next decade.
This increasing prevalence has implications for the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and also for chronic kidney disease (CKD).
A high body mass index is one of the strongest risk factors for new-onset CKD.
In individuals affected by obesity, a compensatory hyperfiltration occurs to meet the heightened metabolic demands of the increased body weight.
The increase in intraglomerular pressure can damage the kidneys and raise the risk of developing CKD in the long term.
The incidence of obesity-related glomerulopathy has increased 10-fold in recent years.
Obesity has also been shown to be a risk factor for nephrolithiasis, and for a number of malignancies including kidney cancer.
This year the World Kidney Day promotes education on the harmful consequences of obesity and its association with kidney disease, advocating healthy lifestyle and health policy measures that make preventive behaviors an affordable option.


Abstract
Recent compelling evidence has shown that the emotional and immunological systems share more than a similarity of functions.
This review article will discuss the crosstalk between these two systems and the need for a new scientific area of research called affective immunology.
Research in this field will allow a better understanding and appreciation of the immunological basis of mental disorders and the emotional side of immune diseases.


Abstract
For many metabolic and mood disorders, this altered immune activity has been characterized as inflammation, with the attendant assumption that the immune response is aberrant.
Further, the inordinate complexity of immune function renders a simplistic, binary model incapable of capturing critical mechanistic insights.
In this perspective article, we propose alternative paradigms for understanding the role of the immune system in chronic disease.


Abstract
Mood disorders continue to be a significant burden to those affected, resulting in significant illness-associated disability and premature mortality.
In addition to mood disturbance, individuals also suffer from other transdiagnostic impairments (eg, anhedonia and cognitive impairment).
Although there have been significant advancements in psychiatric treatment over the last few decades, treatment efficacy (eg, symptom remission, lack of functional recovery, and disease modification) continues to be an important limitation.
In part driven by metabolic comorbidities, a large proportion of individuals with mood disorders also have an imbalance in the inflammatory milieu.
The aim of this review is to highlight evidence implicating inflammation in various effector systems in mood disorders, with a particular focus on the intercommunication with glutamatergic signaling, immune system signaling, as well as metabolic parameters (eg, L-methyl folate bioavailability).
This article also briefly reviews novel and repurposed agents that are capable of targeting the innate immune inflammatory system and possibly correcting an abnormal immune/inflammatory milieu (eg, infliximab).


Abstract
A knock to the immune system in early life might trigger a life-long increased immune reactivity, and infections and autoimmune disorders are now known to be risk factors for development of schizophrenia and MD.
Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines mediate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity; this enzyme drives metabolism of tryptophan and kynurenin in the central nervous system and degrades serotonin.
Moreover, antidepressants and antipsychotics have intrinsic immunomodulatory effects.
With evidence pointing to the role inflammatory processes play in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders, this review will look at various immunological aspects of treatment of such disorders.


Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysfunctions in social interactions resulting from a complex interplay between immunogenetic and environmental risk factors.
Autoimmunity has been proposed as a major etiological component of ASD.
Whether specific autoantibodies directed against brain targets are involved in ASD remains an open question.
The patient exhibited alexithymia and previously suffered from two major depressive episodes without psychotic symptoms.
These findings suggest that the autistic patient NMDAR-Abs do not play a direct role in the etiology of ASD and that other autoantibodies directed against neuronal targets should be investigated.


Abstract
Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neurons affected by inflammatory processes.
Post-mortem analyses of brain and cerebrospinal fluid from PD patients show the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines, confirming an ongoing neuroinflammation in the affected brain regions.
These inflammatory mediators may activate transcription factors-notably nuclear factor κB, Ying-Yang 1 (YY1), fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-which then regulate downstream signaling pathways that in turn promote death of dopaminergic neurons through death domain-containing receptors.
Dopaminergic neurons are vulnerable to oxidative stress and inflammatory attack.
An increased level of inducible nitric oxide synthase observed in the substantia nigra and striatum of PD patients suggests that both cytokine-and chemokine-induced toxicity and inflammation lead to oxidative stress that contributes to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and to disease progression.
Lipopolysaccharide activation of microglia in the proximity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra causes their degeneration, and this appears to be a selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons to inflammation.
In this review, we will look at the role of various transcription factors and signaling pathways in the development of PD.


Abstract
Pediatric palmar contact burns are becoming a common trauma, especially in young children.
Treatment of this kind of burn is challenging as well as controversial, regarding the choice between split-thickness or full-thickness skin graft to close the defect.
The aim of this review was to evaluate the treatment algorithm at our clinic.
We conducted a retrospective study including all patients 0 - 5 years of age admitted to our department from 2008 to 2012 with isolated superficial or deep partial-thickness palmar burns.
The mean age was 16.1 months.
In 27 cases (52.9%) we were able to close the wound conservatively.
Average healing time in this group was 13.3 days.
Two of these 27 patients developed flexion contractures, but none of them required additional operation.
The average time period from the day of injury to the day of surgery was 14.2 days.
We consider split-thickness grafting quick, easy and effective, with minimal to no donor site morbidity and insignificant inflammation complications.
Due to reduced healing time after the actual grafting, rehabilitation can commence earlier.


Abstract
A major problem of burns is the high cost of management, as well as the discrimination and disability they can cause to patients.

The patients were assessed for anxiety, depression and self-esteem using the Hamilton anxiety rating scale, Hamilton depression rating scale and Rosenberg self-esteem scale respectively.
Deep burns, however, were significantly associated with anxiety (p=0.03) and depression (p=0.0002).
Further research is warranted to reveal the magnitude and predictors of psychological problems in burn patients.


Abstract
Plasma lactate (PL) has been used as a marker of cellular hypoxia and shock.
The correlation between PL and clinical outcome has been well accepted in hemorrhagic and septic shock.
In contrast to the existing evidence, there are no or almost no data dealing with lactate and burn-related outcome.
We attempted to assess whether early plasma lactate (PL) is a useful parameter to predict outcome in burned patients.
A prospective study was conducted in a 20-bed adult burn ICU at a university-affiliated teaching hospital in Tunis.
Patients admitted within the first 24h post burn with greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA) burned were enrolled in the study.
Mean age was 40.7 ± 19.5 years old, and average TBSA was 32 ± 21%.
At admission, 86.7% patients had an initial lactate value of more than 2 mmol/L.
Furthermore, plasma lactate cut-off value for mortality prediction was 4.46 mmol/l with a good sensitivity (86%) and specificity (92%).
Plasma lactate appears to be a powerful predictor biomarker of sepsis and mortality in burn patients.


Abstract
Burns are among the most common causes of injury in children.
Several wound dressings are available to conservatively treat second-degree burns.
Seventy-three children were treated with Aquacel Ag foam and Zn-hyaluronon gel to determine their effectiveness on partial thickness burns.
We applied silver nitrate solution on 25% of patients for 24 hrs, then checked burn depth.
All dressings were removed 6-7 days later.
Hot water scalds were the main cause of injury.
Wound size was on average 5% total body surface area.
Burns were seen on all body parts, and in 38 cases on more than one area.
None of the 73 children treated with this dressing were diagnosed with wound infection.
We observed the epithelialization of the burned areas on the 6th or 7th day after primary treatment.
These dressings efficiently promote epithelialization, and a further advantage of Zn-hyaluronon gel is that it enhances cell regeneration and inhibits dressing fixation into the wound.


Abstract
The purpose of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of surgery and follow-up of children operated on for burn sequelae.
For many years, we have organized two missions per year to Benin and Togo, one for surgery and one for follow-up.
Impaired mobility was our only indication for the operation.
We kept a database on all patients.
Long-term follow-up revealed a recurrence of hypertrophic scarring (47%), retractions (24%) and hard cords (2%) due to a lack of occupational therapy and physiotherapy treatment.
Partnership with an NGO and a local team allows us to treat children with burn injury sequelae in Western Africa.
A continued and often long-lasting follow-up by occupational therapists and physiotherapists is highly mandatory in order to guarantee good long-term results.
In 2010, we initiated local rehabilitation therapy.


Abstract
In harvesting skin to cover the defect caused by a burn, a second wound is created, the donor site wound.
We propose an alternative method to manage the donor site: taking a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) from a donor site adjacent to the burn wound to be treated, and meshing at a 3:1 ratio to cover both sites at once.
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of covering both burn wound and adjacent donor site with the same STSG in elderly and bedridden patients.
Their data were compared with data of five patients who had undergone the usual STSG procedure during the same period.
There was a statistically significant difference between patients who underwent adjacent STSG procedure and those who underwent usual STSG procedure in healing time (days) mean (SD) (7,33 ± 1,03 vs. 16,2 ± 0,83; p = 0,007) and Numeric Rating Scale pain mean (SD) at day 2 (0,33 ± 0,33 vs. 2,4 ± 1,35; p = 0,04).
Grafting both acute burn wound and adjacent donor site with the same graft seems to be an easy method to improve healing and minimize pain in the STSG donor site in elderly and bedridden patients.

Abstract
All members of the Association for Ruminant Health were contacted per e-mail.
The survey was completed by 108 (28%) of 393 that were contacted.
The diagnosis is usually based upon the medical history.
Therapy of parturient paresis consists of mixed infusions (with calcium, phosphorus, magnesium or glucose) as well as oral preparations with calcium.
The veterinarians estimate that 25-50% of the cows treated for parturient paresis need more than one treatment and that one case of parturient paresis costs CHF 200-300.


Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are an important class of carbohydrates that serve critical roles in blood clotting, tissue repair, cell migration and adhesion, and lubrication.
The variable sulfation pattern and iduronate ring conformations in GAGs influence their polymeric structure and nature of interaction.
The force field additions include parameters and charges for a transferable sulfate group for O- and N-sulfation, neutral (COOH) forms of iduronic and glucuronic acid, and Δ4,5-unsaturated uronate (ΔUA) residues.
ΔUA residues frequently arise from the enzymatic digestion of heparin and heparin sulfate.
Simulations of disaccharides containing ΔUA reveal that the presence of sulfation on this residue alters the relative populations of 1H2 and 2H1 ring conformations.


Abstract
The quality of care provided by health systems contributes towards efforts to reach sustainable development goal 3 on health and well-being.
There is growing evidence that the impact of health interventions is undermined by poor quality of care in lower-income countries.
Quality of care will also be crucial to the success of universal health coverage initiatives; citizens unhappy with the quality and scope of covered services are unlikely to support public financing of health care.
Moreover, an ethical impetus exists to ensure that all people, including the poorest, obtain a minimum quality standard of care that is effective for improving health.
However, the measurement of quality today in low- and middle-income countries is inadequate to the task.
Existing measures poorly capture the process of care and the patient experience.
Patient outcomes that are sensitive to health-care practices, a mainstay of quality assessment in high-income countries, are rarely collected.
We propose six policy recommendations to improve quality-of-care measurement and amplify its policy impact: (i) redouble efforts to improve and institutionalize civil registration and vital statistics systems; (ii) reform facility surveys and strengthen routine information systems; (iii) innovate new quality measures for low-resource contexts; (iv) get the patient perspective on quality; (v) invest in national quality data; and (vi) translate quality evidence for policy impact.

Abstract
Being able to analyze all the successive steps of decision making from the first contact with the patient to the final diagnosis is complex because it refers sometimes to intuitive elements proper to each clinician.
However, understanding how they integrate probabilities of diseases into their clinical practice and manage diagnostic uncertainties is crucial.
This allows a more rational practice of medicine and identifying factors related to the patient, physician or context that may modify the clinical decision making.
Furthermore, the use of tools such as clinical scores has taken an important place with the evidence based medicine.
Given the fact that they are partly theoretical, it is necessary to assess whether these recommendations are in line with clinical practice.

Abstract
Zika virus suddenly emerged in Latin America in 2015‑2016.
In addition, sexual transmission of Zika virus has been well documented.
This led to the development of prevention strategies and recommendations for travellers visiting at risk countries.
These documents are regularly amended depending on the evolution of scientific knowledge, the epidemiologic trends and the national and international guidelines.
Through practical cases, we present here the guidelines developed by the Geneva University Hospitals.


Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem which affects also tropical countries.
Travelers to these regions expose themselves to the risk of being colonised and infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria.
Colonisation with meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococci are often due to contacts with the health care system of the visited country.
For the practitioner evaluating a patient returning from abroad it is important to consider the risk of infection with multidrug-resistant bacteriae.
Screening for these bacteriae in the stool or by mucocutaneous swabs can be discussed in certain situations.

Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are responsible for many deaths in our western societies.
Practice of sport activities can decrease their occurrence and improve the prognosis of the patients already affected.
The practice of a sport, however, presents an increased cardiovascular risk during its realization (sudden death, myocardial infarction, etc.).
A regular medical follow-up is necessary as well as a respect of instructions of good sport practice.


Abstract
The prevalence is assessed in the general population at 2.2 %.
Various risk factors were identified: age, gender, level of education and socio-economic status.
Various etiological hypotheses have been explored, whether in neuroimaging or from the point of view of possible neuroendocrine and cytokine perturbations.
In addition, various potential pathogenic mechanisms have been identified: genetic predisposition, central amplification, diffuse inhibitory control failure, muscle as peripheral nociceptive afferents.
Finally, with regard to treatment and clinical course, the first will be multidisciplinary and the second will not be marked by real remission.
In addition, patients tend to reduce their activities (professional, physical or leisure), which degrades and perpetuates the situation, while they must remain as active as possible.


Abstract
The prevalence of gestational diabetes increases as a result of universal screening, but also because of more stringent diagnostic criteria due to decreased set points.
This diabetes can lead to severe complications for the offspring and / or for the mother.
The management of a patient suffering from gestational diabetes is based on healthy diet and lifestyle advices.
Iterative control of capillary glycemia is the usual way to monitor daily blood glucose.
Continuous blood glucose measurement (CGM) provides reliable and comprehensive data over several days.
Observing and interpreting the continuously recorded glucose concentration values should help to better understand the kinetics of glucose and to personalize the treatment.
The CGM analysis shows that the maximum concentration of postprandial glucose is reached approximately 70 minutes after the morning and midday meals and 110 minutes after the evening meal.

Satisfaction levels with family physician services: a pilot national health programme in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study was conducted in 2014 to measure the rate of user satisfaction with services provided by family physicians to the rural and urban population of the second most populated county in Fars province (Marvdasht county, population > 330 000).
In urban and rural areas, 1650 houses (825 in rural and 825 in urban areas) were selected, of which 1561 houses were inhabited (2908 individuals in urban and 3062 individuals in rural areas) and an interview-administered doorstep questionnaire was completed.
Overall satisfaction rate was 59.2%: 54.5% for urban areas and 63.2% for rural areas.
This study suggests that satisfaction is higher among rural residents and that better quality services from family physicians are needed in both rural and urban communities.

Effect of Ramadan fasting on glucose level, lipid profile, HbA1c and uric acid among medical students in Karachi, Pakistan.
Total physical activity, weight-to-height ratio, body adiposity index and visceral adiposity index were calculated for insulin sensitivity.
Changes in anthropometric measurements were not statistically significant.
However, physical activities increased significantly after Ramadan.
Changes in blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, HbA1c, uric acid and triglyceride were not statistically significant.
Mean high density lipoprotein decreased significantly in Ramadan, while low density lipoprotein increased significantly.


Abstract
Correlation between hepatitis C viral load and hepatitis C Core antigenaemia among Egyptians.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is widespread in Egypt.
This study compared HCV RNA with HCVcAg for the detection and quantification of viraemia among a sample of Egyptians.
Of the 80 samples, 25% were HCV-RNA-negative.
HCVcAg was detected in all samples: range 0.4-2462 ng/mL, mean 460 (SD 506) ng/mL.
The sensitivity and specificity of HCVcAg were 96.7% and 90.9%, respectively.
There was a significant correlation between serum HCV-RNA and HCVcAg levels (r = 0.4, P < 0.0001).
HCV-RNA remains the gold standard for diagnosis of active HCV infection but HCVcAg can be used where PCR is not available.


Abstract
This cross-sectional study aimed to assess interpretation of symptoms as a cause of delays in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
It was conducted at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.
The sample included 93 patients: 73 male, mean age 57.89 (12.13) years.
Prehospital delay time ranged from 15 minutes to 10 days, with a median of 2 hours (interquartile range: 9.50).
Patients waited for pain to go away (48.4%) and tried to calm down (39.8%).
Most patients attributed AMI-related symptoms to a reason other than heart disease.
In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the type of AMI was classified based on electrocardiography findings (odds ratio 5.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.69-15.91, P=0.004) and was independently associated with a long prehospital delay time, indicating that patients with ST segment elevation MI would seek early medical care.
Misinterpretation of symptoms and misconceptions about emergency treatment during AMI cause delays in admission and may affect treatment.


Abstract
Association of rotating night shift with lipid profile among nurses in an Egyptian tertiary university hospital.
The main objective was to identify whether night shift nurses are more prone to dyslipidaemia than day shift nurses.
One hundred and fifty female nurses aged 20-49 years were recruited from Ain Shams University Hospitals, Egypt, from January to March 2016: 64 day shift and 86 night shift.
Diet type was assessed by interview questionnaire and job satisfaction was assessed using the job satisfaction survey.
Triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were measured in all nurses.
The only predictor of high LDL level (> 130 mg/dl) was age ≥ 40 years.


Abstract
Improving influenza vaccination rates of healthcare workers: a multipronged approach in Qatar.
During the 2014/15 influenza season, IV rates according to hospital and HCW category were calculated and compared with the 2 seasons before the intervention.
The combined mean rate for IV for both hospitals increased for 2014/15 (64.3%) compared with 2013/14 (37.2%) and 2012/13 (28.4%).
There was increased IV uptake among doctors and nurses at each hospital, and the IV rate for the 2 hospitals (59.1 and 69.5%) were higher than in 2013/14 (21.1% and 53.2%) and 2012/13 (17.2% and 39.6%).
The findings highlight the importance of improving IV rates among HCWs in hospitals with no mandatory vaccination policies through multicomponent interventions.


Abstract
Sectorisation was introduced in Tunisia in 1999.
A transversal study was conducted over a period of 5 months from 1 November 2014 to 31 March 2015 on 96 patients resident in the state of Nabeul and treated at Razi hospital.
Patients were aged between 18 and 69 years old ( sex ratio equal to one), 55.2% were single and 46% had a low socioeconomic level (n=44).
Chronic psychotic disorder was diagnosed in 64.3% , depression in 12.3%, bipolar disorder in 18.8% and mental retardation in 3% of cases.
Most of them refused to continue psychiatric treatment in the second or the first line of care.
Resistance to sectorisation was associated with a low socioeconomic level (P = 0.039), availability of a companion (P = 0.04), celibacy (P = 0.04), gender (P = 0.05) and negatively correlated to psychotic disorder diagnosis.
It was concluded that the environment plays an important role in the choice of the place of care.

Abstract
Post-myocardial infarction ventricular septal defect corresponds to the rupture of the ventricular septum between the healthy and infarcted parts.
It is a rare complication still associated with a high mortality rate.
Its diagnostic should be evoked in case of pathologic cardiac auscultation and confirmed by emergent transthoracic echocardiography.
Hemodynamic stabilisation, mainly with the insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump is the first step in the management.
Successful closure decreases the 30-day mortality rate to 30-40 %.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is constantly rising.
Different studies have underlined the correlation between AF and modifiable risk factors such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension and sedentary lifestyle.
Treatment of these comorbidities could significantly reduce the AF burden and the recurrence rate after cardioversion or ablation.
A strategy limited to catheter ablation or to the prescription of an antiarrhythmic drug is not sufficient.

Abstract
Hiatal hernia is a frequent pathology.
Two types have been described : sliding hernia and paraesophageal hernia (PEH).
The first one is the most frequent and is associated with reflux disease.
Operative management is necessary for sliding hernia with reflux disease and for symptomatic PEH, respectively.
In patients with asymptomatic PEH, operative risk must be balanced with the risk of postoperative complications.
No specific operative technique has been validated so far as surgical standard.
Several technical details are important and technique has to be adapted according to the size and type of hernia, preoperative symptoms and patient's comorbidities.

Abstract
The cerebral pseudotumor (PTC) is defined by the increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, a normal composition of the latter in the absence of identified intracranial structural abnormalities, in particular by neuroimaging.
The pathophysiology of PTC is poorly understood although its diagnostic criteria are well established.
Drugs such as minocycline, tetracycline and doxycycline have been repeatedly implicated as a causative factor in PTC.
The prognosis of PTC related to minocycline, reported in the literature is quite variable.
Some authors suggest a benign condition with spontaneous healing by stopping the antibiotic, while others report permanent loss of vision.
A 12-year-old girl is admitted to the emergency room for progressively progressive pulsatile temporal headaches associated with diplopia.
The patient reported the use of minocycline 50 mg / d for five months, prescribed by her attending physician as part of an acne treatment.
PTC will be demonstrated by severe papillary edema and cerebral NMR will demonstrate an enlargement of the subarachnoid space around the optic nerves.
After three lumbar punctures, the condition of the patient stabilized and there was a marked improvement in headache despite the persistence of bilateral papillary edema.
This work describes a clinical case of PTC induced by the use of minocycline and reviews the physiopathology, the diagnosis and the management of this one.

This pain may be present in different areas of the abdomen, even in the shoulder, usually well localized, and described as cramping or stabbing depending on the severity.
The etiology is still debated, with many possible theories.
It is a benign problem but other pathologies, often more severe, must be excluded in case of any atypical presentation.
There are simple preventive measures recommended.
This pain usually disappears within minutes by slowing or stopping the effort and / or using different methods without scientific validation until now.

Diarrhea is one of the most common complaints in oncologic patients.
Causes are multiple including bowel resection, infections, radiation and systemic anti-cancer treatments.
In the latter case, the pathophysiology is partially elucidated and requires the etiology to be precisely identified : chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
Loperamide remains central in uncomplicated cases.
However, with development of immunotherapy, autoimmune mechanism should be recognized and requires different approach based mainly on corticosteroids.

Abstract
Hepatitis D or delta is a chronic liver disease globally reaching 15‑20M people.
Its agent, hepatitis D virus (HDV) requires the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to complete its life cycle.
It represents one of the most severe forms of viral hepatitis.
Current therapy with pegylated interferon alpha leads to viral eradication only in 25 % of cases.
New treatments targeting the virus life cycle are sought.
For example Myrcludex-B, which inhibits the entry into hepatocytes, lonafarnib which prevents the assemblage of the viral particle and the molecule REP 2139 which, among other unclear mechanisms, impedes the exit of the virus.
This allows considering a better management of a condition for which there is currently no satisfactory treatment.

Abstract
Various cells of the thalamus, hippocampus, and the medial entorhinal cortex plays a crucial role in spatial navigation ability.
The vision, olfaction, and the vestibular system contribute to this complex system.
These observations may well explain why patients with vestibular disorder complain of spatial disorientation, often a source of deep anxiety.


Abstract
The human brain is able to consider that two sensory stimuli are synchronous while they activate the cortex with some delay because they follow different neurological pathways.
This process is only possible if the time interval between the two stimuli does not exceed a certain limit, called "Temporal Binding Window" (TBW).
By cons, in patients equipped with a vestibular implant, it is possible to generate a vestibular perception selectively by electrical stimulation of the vestibular nerve.
These patients are therefore an unique model to study the TBW between visual and vestibular perception.

Pilot data suggest that, while few patients were oriented to the APAs in the pilot project, family physicians appreciate the possibility of collaborating with the APAs.


Abstract
Faced with diffuse pain, the doctor must evoke a wide range of pathologies.
It is necessary to think about rare illnesses such as myopathy or vasculitis, but also more common illnesses such as fibromyalgia.
Contrary to popular belief, it is difficult to give a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, on average 2 years after the onset of symptoms.
This can be explained by heterogeneous complaints and the doctor delaying the diagnosis with unnecessary complimentary examinations.
Patient education and physical activity are the most important steps of treatment.
Few drugs have proven effective and their use is limited due to significant side effects.
The evolution of fibromyalgia is chronic, with a mixed prognosis.


Abstract
This chapter does not address complex situations.


Abstract
Multi-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a world-wide public-health problem with about half a million cases/year (of a total of 9 million cases of TB).
Patients at highest risk for MDR-TB are those who have already been treated.

Abstract
The sounds produced by joints are a common source of questioning for doctors and their patients.
Two major types are identified : cracks and crepitus.
Few investigations have been carried out on these manifestations, while they potentially have clinical implications, especially for patellar crepitus in patellofemoral osteoarthrosis, and may generate anxiety.
Knuckle cracking appears to be caused by the sudden and temporary occurrence of an intra-articular gaseous cavity, called tribonucleation.
Other researches on these sounds are focused on the knees and their links with osteoarthritis, as well as on the spine.
Many questions still arise but it seems important to talk about it with patients without trivializing them.

Abstract
The isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance, serotypes, virulence factors and genetic diversity.
Genetic diversity was determined by repetitive palindromic PCR (rep- PCR) revealing a heterogenous population.
The most prevalent E. coli serotypes found were K88ac (18%), O139:K82 (6%), O141:K85ac (5%), O108:K`V189` (5%), O119:K`V113` (3%) and O157:K`V17` (2%).
The combination of toxins EAST-1, STb and LT-I and adhesin F4 characterizing ETEC was the most frequent.
The shigatoxin Stx2e (STEC) and intimin Eae (EPEC) were also detected, but less frequently.
Seventy percent of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 29% were resistant to more than 3 antibiotics.
Isolates exhibited resistance to tetracycline (50%) associated to resistance genes tet(A), tet(B) and tet(C), sulfamethoxazole (49%) [sul1, sul2 and sul3], trimethoprim (34%) [dfr], nalidixic acid (29%), ampicillin (26%) [blaTEM-1], gentamicin (17%) [aac(3) -IIc, aac(3) -IVa and aac(3) -VIa], chloramphenicol (17%) [catAI and catAIII], and ciprofloxacin (8%) [mutations in GyrA (S83L) and ParC (S80I)].
All isolates were susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, colistin and tigecycline.

Obesity is a chronic illness involving serious somatic comorbidities and psychological disorders.


Abstract
The worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled since 1980.
We attempted to project the prevalence of obesity in the canton of Vaud in the next 25 years.
Data from the Enquête suisse sur la santé, a survey conducted every five years since 1992 by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, were used.
Using different mathematical assumptions, the rate of increase in the prevalence of obesity in Switzerland between 1992 and 2012 was calculated allowing a projection of future prevalences.


Abstract
Obesity and mental disorders are frequent diseases in our society and do not always receive the appropriate care.


Abstract
Non stabilized severe eating disorder is a contra-indication for bariatric surgery.
Specific cares can stabilize this disorder, and therefore a surgery can be undertaken.
Clarification of the food addiction concept should permit to reconsider the specific cares needed by these obese patients.


Abstract
Obesity has become a worldwide public health concern.
Bariatric surgery is nowadays the most effective treatment to lose weight and control somatic comorbidities of this disease.


Abstract
Dumping syndromes are a frequent complication of gastric or bariatric surgery and include early and late dumping.
Early dumping is a consequence of rapid delivery of hyperosmolar nutrients into the bowel.
Late dumping is the result of a reactive hypoglycemia induced by a hyperinsulinemic response.
Effective management of these complications requires multidisciplinary collaboration.


Abstract
Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) is a potentially severe food allergy.
Physical exercise, NSAID, alcohol, infectious diseases and estrogens are recognized cofactors, able to reduce the amount of allergen needed to achieve a threshold for the induction of anaphylaxis.
Various kinds of causative food but only a few responsible proteins have been identified.
The best known is wheat ω5-gliadine.


Abstract
The diagnosis is made a posteriori, once the levels of immunoglobulins are normalized, in general between 2 and 4 years of age.


Abstract
Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare multisystemic non-Langerhans histiocytosis with about 500 reported cases.


Abstract
Hypersensitivity to human seminal plasma is rare, but probably under-diagnosed.
It should be suspected in women with unexplained anaphylaxis, vulvo-vaginitis, pelvic pain and dyspareunia.
Premedication with antihistamines or anti-inflammatory agents is often unreliable.
In case of pregnancy wish, artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilization with spermatozoids is an alternative to desensitization.


Abstract
Segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) is a rare non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology mostly affecting medium-sized arteries of the splanchnic circulation.
The clinical and radiological presentation can mimic vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia or collagen vascular diseases.
SAM is often self-limited and may be managed conservatively with adequate blood pressure control in the majority of cases.


Abstract
This approach answers both diagnostic and research needs, facilitates the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie IIDs, and ultimately leads to the discovery of new therapeutic targets.


Abstract
Sweet's syndrome is a rare neutrophilic dermatosis.

Abstract
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is an economically important disease in the swine industry.
Previous studies demonstrated the presence of the virus in pig meat and its transmissibility by oral consumption.
This study further analyzed the infectivity of PRRSV in commercial pig meat.
Fresh bottom meat pieces (n = 1500) randomly selected over a period of 2 y from a pork ham boning plant located in Quebec, Canada, were tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Each trimmed meat was stored in the plant freezer, subsampled weekly for up to 15 wk, and tested with quantitative RT-PCR to determine the viral load.
Meat infectivity was evaluated using specific pathogen-free piglets, each fed with approximately 500 g of meat at the end of the storage time.
Genotype-specific RT-PCR confirmed the presence of PRRSV mainly during cold weather in 0.73% of the fresh meat pieces.
Wild and vaccine strains of genotype 2 were detected.


Abstract
A total of 35 colostrum-fed, cross-bred, conventional piglets were randomly divided into 7 groups.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of a long-term antioxidant-supplemented diet to regulate the oxidative stress and general health status of dogs involved in animal-assisted intervention (AAI) programs.
Oxidative stress is a consequence of the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Exercise-induced oxidative stress can increase muscle fatigue and fiber damage and eventually leads to impairment of the immune system.
A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical evaluation was conducted with 11 healthy therapy dogs: 6 females and 5 males of different breeds and with a mean age of 2.7 ± 0.8 y (mean ± SEM).


Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the digital Brix and optical serum total protein (STP) refractometers for measuring concentrations of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) in alpacas and compare them to IgG concentrations measured by the reference method of radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay.
The correlation between Brix % and STP was high [correlation coefficient (r) = 0.99].


Abstract
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard of care in human medicine for gall bladder disease.
Although infrequently reported in veterinary literature, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is an option for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in canine patients.
Due to the risk of cystic duct ligature slippage or clip dislodgement, we wanted to explore the use of a LigaTie; a novel absorbable medical device modeled after a cable tie.
Samples of caprine gall bladder, liver, and cystic duct were collected.
Maximum cystic duct pressure was recorded.


Abstract
Dogs were classified into 2 groups based on the severity of clinical signs.
Group A - asymptomatic to mild clinical signs, group B - moderate to severe clinical signs.
The serum SDMA levels were higher in dogs in group B. Although the serum SDMA levels in dogs in group A were also higher than those of the control dogs, the difference was not statistically significant.
There was a good correlation between renal markers and severity of clinical signs.
This study demonstrated that the glomerular filtration rate was significantly decreased in dogs in group A; therefore, earlier detection of renal impairment is required for successful management of dogs with HWD.


Abstract
Sixteen singleton adult merino ewes weighing 60.1 ± 5.1 kg at 125.7 d (124 to 126 d) gestation were anesthetized.


Abstract
International comparisons of animal antimicrobial use (AMU) have typically been based on total national estimates of antimicrobials sales standardized by the national animal biomass calculated as the population correction unit (PCU).
The objective of this paper was to compare the currently accepted PCU calculation with that of the adjusted population correction unit (APCU), which re-evaluates the standard animal weights used in the calculation and accounts for animal lifespan.
The APCU calculation resulted in substantial changes to the 2009 national biomass estimates for cattle, pigs, and poultry in 8 European countries and Canada.
The estimated national biomass for cattle increased 35% to 43%, while the estimated national biomass of pigs and poultry typically decreased by approximately 51% and 87%, respectively.
Among the 9 countries, the total national APCU ranged from an increase of 1% to a decrease of 40% relative to PCU, and these differences were statistically significant.


Abstract
Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, the psychosocial management of persons living with HIV remains complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.
An auto-evaluation scale of psychosocial difficulties and needs was used by a team of nurses working in an HIV outpatient clinic.
This instrument also allowed implementing a number of targeted nurse interventions to improve the management of these patients.

Observational data show a consistent association between elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).


Abstract
Physicians can assess the risk of fracture based on bone density (BMD) and several risk factors.
BMD didnot take into account the microarchitecture.
TBS is a texture parameter related to bone microarchitecture.
A low TBS is associated with a history of fracture and the incidence of new fracture independently of BMD, clinical risk factors and FRAX.
It is particularly useful for the evaluation of secondary osteoporosis, including type 2 diabetes, Gluco-corticoïd induced osteoporosis.
It responds to osteoporosis treatments and is not influenced by lumbar degenerative disorders.


Abstract
Other factors may contribute to higher fracture risk in overweight patients, notably higher frequency of falls and lower bioavailability of vitamin D stoked in fat.


Abstract
The adult form can be easily confused with trivial osteoporosis.
Early tooth loss and renal calcifications can orient towards the diagnosis.
The diagnosis is based on low serum ALP levels (< 40 U/L) and high ALP substrate levels, such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxin), eventually on genetic testing.
Recent development of an enzyme replacement therapy offers new therapeutic perspectives in severe cases.


Abstract
Teriparatide is still the only bone forming agent available, its use is limited to 24 months.
Except the absence of new fragility fractures, there is no well defined target in the treatment of osteoporosis.
Nevertheless persistence of high fracture risk (prevalent fractures and/or low BMD) on therapy indicates to maintain or intensify the treatment.


Abstract
Denosumab is a very effective treatment of osteoporosis, easy to use and very well tolerated.
Due to some associated risks, a close clinical follow-up is necessary.
Injections of denosumab should be done scrupulously every 6 months (± 3 weeks).
Discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a severe rebound effect characterized by increased markers of bone remodeling, a rapid decrease of bone density values, and a risk of multiple spontaneous vertebral fractures.
The administration of a potent bisphosphonate (zoledronate, alendronate) minimises or avoids this rebound effect.

This article consists of a literature review concerning the evidence for the benefits of physical activity in seniors in terms of quality of life, longevity, maintenance of functional independence, and prevention of cognitive decline.


Abstract
The benefit of endovascular treatment (ET) after acute ischemic stroke has long been debated.


Abstract
Two therapeutic options are currently available : angioplasty with stent placement and endarterectomy.
As a result, each case should be reviewed with a multidisciplinary approach in order to propose the best therapeutic strategy.


Abstract
Dissections of the cervical arteries account for approximately 15-20 % of all strokes in young patients.
Clinically they present with laterocervical and/or hemicranial pain associated to a Horner syndrome in case of carotid dissection and a posterior cervical pain associated to headache in the occipital area in case of vertebral dissection.
A multifactorial origin is often suggested, resulting from the combination of a weakness of the arterial wall, hereditary or not, of environmental factors such minor trauma or a previous infection and also of the presence of a certain number of vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure or migraines.
The diagnosis is best established with MRI which shows specifically the intramural hematoma.
Treatment includes anticoagulants or antiplatelets agents.

Abstract
Occult hepatitis B infection in Egyptian health care workers.
We tested the frequency of occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCWs).
HCV RNA was measured by nested PCR in anti-HCV-positive HCWs.
HBV-DNA-positive HCWs were subjected to HBV genotyping.
We included 132 HCWs who were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc).
OBI was detected in 7 male HCWs, and HBV E genotype was detected in 3, HBV D in 2 and HBV D and E in 2.
Two OBI-positive HCWs had a history of neonatal hepatitis B vaccination.
Anti-HCV seropositivity was detected in 17 HCWs who were positive for anti-HBc; 15 of whom were positive for HCV RNA by nested PCR.
HCV infection was confirmed by anti-HCV and HCV RNA in 1 of 7 HCWs with OBI.
In conclusion, Egyptian HCWs have a significant rate of OBI and HBV E genotype is prevalent.


Abstract
Mediator role of experiential avoidance in relationship of perceived stress and alexithymia with mental health.
This cross-sectional study investigated the mediatory role of experiential avoidance in the relationship between perceived stress and alexithymia with mental health.
We enrolled 440 students (age 18-30 years) at Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences through stratified random sampling method.
The study tools were demographic checklist, GHQ-28, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 and Perceived Stress Scale.
Data were analysed by SPSS-18 and AMOS-18 using Pearson correlation, hierarchical regression analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM).
There was a significant positive correlation between perceived stress and experiential avoidance, and alexithymia and mental health problems (P < 0.001).
The mediatory role of experiential avoidance was confirmed in such a way that the effects of alexithymia and perceived stress decreased.


Abstract
Coverage of tobacco control in Jordanian newspapers: implications for strengthening the role of news media.
News media play a critical role in tobacco control.
To strengthen this role in Jordan, four newspapers were searched and 1 145 articles between 2011 and 2015 were coded for mention of MPOWER topics and for tone of coverage (neutral, pro-, or anti-tobacco control).
Monthly counts, mention of tobacco control topics and the tones were examined.
The monthly count of tobacco control-related news items showed an upward trend with an average monthly growth of 16%.
Peaks in coverage were observed in synchrony with national tobacco control developments.
'Warn' was the topic most frequently mentioned (46%).
'Protect' was the only topic that showed a statistically significant upward trend over time.
A pro-tobacco control tone was more prevalent than an antitobacco control or neutral tone.
Thus, efforts are needed to enhance the newsworthiness of certain topics, boost influence on decision-makers and pre-empt industry interference.


Abstract
Awareness among a Saudi Arabian university community of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus following an outbreak.
A self-administered questionnaire containing knowledge questions was distributed and completed by the 1541 participants.
The majority (78.9%) of the respondents recognized the typical symptoms of MERS-CoV but only 67.1% knew the recommended preventive hygiene practices.
Awareness of disease epidemiology, severity, fatality rate and treatment was very low.
The knowledge of health care workers/ students of the recommended precautions that should be applied when dealing with patients was poor (55.5%).
Significant improvement in educational programmes for both the health care and non-health care professionals is warranted, particularly in crowded educational institutions or workplaces.


Abstract
Medical students` perceptions of supporting pharmacology learning in English by key information prepared in Arabic.
This study targeted third-year medical students at the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain (n= 183).
During the endocrine and metabolism subunit, which is taught in English, slides containing focused information in Arabic preceded detailed English ones.
At the end of the subunit, students` perceptions were explored by a questionnaire and focus group discussions.
Most participants reported that this intervention made pharmacology learning easier, improved confidence in drug selection, knowledge of adverse drug reactions, detection of response to medications and occurrence of adverse reactions.
Most respondents thought that this intervention would help them during the clinical phase of their study and in communicating drug therapy to patients in Arabic.
Supporting pharmacology learning in a foreign language with instructional materials prepared in a native language improved students self-reported learning and satisfaction.


Abstract
Health production and determinants of health systems performance in WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate were used as outputs, and total health expenditures per capita, number of physicians, nurses, and midwives, and number of hospital beds per thousand population were used as inputs to the health systems.
The determinants of TE of the health systems were examined using a regression model.
The relationship between unemployment and out-of-pocket health expenditure was not significantly associated with TE of the health systems.
To improve TE of the health systems, countries should focus on individuals' empowerment in education and income level, rather than only on providing healthcare services.


Abstract
Use of traditional medicine among type 2 diabetic Libyans.
The use of traditional medicines is common among patients with chronic illnesses and this practice might pose health risks.
The use among Libyan patients with diabetes is unknown.
Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of traditional medicine use in the previous year among Libyans with type 2 diabetes and to examine the association between its use and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients.
A cross-sectional study was conducted at a large diabetes centre in Tripoli.
A self-reported questionnaire was used for data collection.
Of the 523 respondents, 28.9% used traditional remedies.
Sex was the only variable significantly associated with traditional medicine use; more women used traditional medicines (P = 0.01).
A total of 77 traditional medicine items were reported to be used, of which herbs were the most common.
The use of traditional medicine for diabetes is prevalent and some of the reported items could pose health risks.
Health education programmes are suggested to raise the awareness of the health risks of this practice.


Abstract
We used a set of criteria by referring to the national immunization programme.
The cold chain was respected in most cases.
Accumulators, the collector of syringes and needles, cotton balls soaked in alcohol and emergency box were available in 85.5%, 76.4%, 98.2% and 41.8% of cases respectively.
Hand washing before immunization session was performed in 29.1% of cases.
Waste disposal according to the hygiene rules was done by 40 agents.
Health education of students regarding the interest of vaccination was done in 67.3% of cases.
Therefore, improvements in hand hygiene practice and education are recommended.


Abstract
The tools used for data collection have been shared for adaptation and use by other researchers.


Abstract
We present a case of an eight-year-old boy with a specific phobia of vomiting who developed subsequent food restriction and weight loss.
Our case report includes a review of treatment modalities for specific phobias including cognitive behavioural and exposure therapy in young children and the importance of parental involvement in the treatment process.
After an initial assessment and diagnosis of this boy with emetophobia, treatment took place over ten subsequent visits, one hour each in duration.
His treatment included a cognitive approach utilizing exposure therapy to re-introduce foods to his diet, working through a fear hierarchy, addressing cognitive distortions/misconceptions and psychoeducational supports.
Intermittent reinforcement was applied to help extinguish what we believe was an associatively learned fear of vomiting.
Outcomes of the treatment were measured by changes in behaviour and overall increase in food intake reported by the patient's parents.
A post-treatment three-week telephone follow-up showed continued gains.
Congruent with reported literature this case confirms and highlights the efficacy of exposure therapy and age-appropriate cognitive treatment adaptations in treatment of emetophobia.
In addition, parental education and participation is recommended in treatment of child cases.


Abstract
Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is new in the DSM-5, replacing the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood.
This report illustrates the case of an 11-year-old boy of Colombian ancestry with ARFID and explores the role of culture in the diagnosis of ARFID.
To date, literature describing this disorder is limited.
ARFID is often seen in the child and adolescent population and can have significant medical consequences, including weight loss, hemodynamic instability, and growth retardation.
This paper is intended to inform the reader about this multifaceted disorder, and to generate interest for future research.

Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is a major problem.
The prisons in Chhattisgarh, India, are overcrowded, and there are no formal efforts to engage them in TB control.
Sensitisation meetings (one/quarter/prison) to improve awareness among prisoners about TB symptoms and services were coupled with improved access to diagnosis.
Patients with presumptive TB who were examined by sputum microscopy increased by 39% per 100 000 prisoners, and TB case notification rates increased by 38%, in 2014 relative to 2013.


Abstract
The proportion of tuberculosis (TB) patients tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the state of Ra-jasthan, India, is limited by the availability of HIV testing facilities.

The proportion of TB patients tested for HIV increased by respectively 27% and 19%.


Abstract
Urban informality is typically ascribed to the urban poor in cities of the Global South.
Drawing on Judith
But
ler's concept of performativity and taking the case of Rio de Janeiro in the context of the 2016 Olympic Games, this article conceptualizes informality as a signifier and a procedural, relational category.
This article offers new perspectives to better understand the relationship between informality and confinement by examining the active role that inhabitants of marginalized settlements assume in the Olympic City.


Abstract
Drawing on a multi-year study with digital workers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-east Asia, this article highlights four key concerns for workers: bargaining power, economic inclusion, intermediated value chains, and upgrading.
The article shows that although there are important and tangible benefits for a range of workers, there are also a range of risks and costs that unduly affect the livelihoods of digital workers.


Abstract
The aim of the Vigilance System is the identification of rare events to assess the individual risks of the vaccine application.
As in previous years, companion animals were involved in most of the adverse effects (48% dogs, 21% cats), followed by cattle (13%).
In cats, apathy was most frequently observed regardless of the vaccination.


Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Probiotics in Progress (PIP) on the establishment of a competitive flora as well as on antibiotic use and losses of suckling piglets in pig breeding farms.
The tested products were PIP AHC® and PIP AHS® produced by "Chrisal AG" in Lommel, Belgium.
The use of PIP-products did not lead to any significant effect on the pen flora.
Only very few swab samples contained a majority of probiotic Bacillus spp.


Abstract
The interest in equine dentistry has significantly increased in the last 15 years.
With a return rate of 45% (1'466 of 3'250 sent questionnaires) significant conclusions could be drawn.
Horse owners showed a strong demand for clarification regarding tooth problems, the causes, consequences and methods of treatment.
More than half of the owners considered themselves not well informed.
The treating person was in 66.7% a veterinarian with a special education.
Horse owners indicated that information circulated most frequently by word of mouth recommendations and they explicitly wished information from professional and reliable sources.
The questionnaire provided a clear result about current equine dental treatments.
We suggest that they should be performed by veterinarians only with a special education.


Abstract
There are many definitions of health, resulting from 4 main paradigms.


Abstract
Ameloblastoma is an odontogenic tumour that represents 1 % of oral tumours but 10 % of odontogenic tumours.
Ameloblastoma is characterized by low and noiseless growth, that explains a lot of advanced forms.
The tumour is known as benign with local malignity due to its locally invasive behaviour and its recurrence.
The treatment choice remains complicated because of recurring nature and large resection in vital anatomical areas.
The therapeutic approach will be based on size, anatomical localisation, histologic variants and anatomical complications.
The treatment options should be discussed with the patient because of possible important morphological and functional sequelae.


Abstract
Haemangioma are benign, vasoformative lesions of endothelial origin.

Abstract
We report a case of spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage by bleeding of an adrenal adenoma.
Retroperitoneal haemorrhages are rarely encountered in practice, but must be rapidly diagnosed due to the life threatening risk.
The etiologies, clinical assessment, management and differential diagnosis of spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhages are discussed.


Abstract
Chronic osteomyelitis is a chronic inflammatory disease induced by bone infection.
It may be limited to a single portion of bone or involve several areas such as marrow, cortical, periosteum and adjacent soft tissues.
Being able to persist for weeks, months or even years, it remains a therapeutic challenge in spite of the important medical and surgical advances, with a prolonged and complex management given the nature of the surgical interventions and the antibiotherapies required.
We report a case of chronic osteomyelitis treated by long-term suppressive antibiotic therapy, which may be a reasonable alternative to surgery in inoperable clinical situations, but taking into account the risks associated with it in terms of side effects and selection of resistant organisms, as well as the cost of treatment and the quality of life of the patient.


Abstract

Abstract
In low-income countries like Uganda, many such stockpiles are the result of donations.
If not adequately monitored or regulated, expired pharmaceuticals may be repackaged and sold as counterfeits or be dumped without any thought of the potential environmental damage.
The rates of pharmaceutical expiry in the supply chain need to be reduced and the disposal of expired pharmaceuticals needs to be made both timely and safe.


Abstract
Surveillance of communicable diseases for decisionmaking in Egypt: 2006-2013.
The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population surveillance system provides data about notifiable communicable diseases.
This study aimed to provide information for decision-making to reduce the burden of communicable diseases in Egypt by analysis of the surveillance data for 2006-2013 to identify trends in the incidence of the diseases by governorate, season, age and sex.
Composite risk-index scores were estimated to rank the 27 Egyptian governorates into 3 groups: high, medium and low risk.
There were 11 high-risk governorates; Ismailia had the highest risk-index score.


Abstract
The relation between pica and iron deficiency in children in Zanjan, Islamic Republic of Iran: a case-control study.
The aim of this case-control study was to determine the frequency of pica and its relationship with iron deficiency in children in Zanjan.
We selected 872 children and determined the frequency of pica.
We selected students who did not have pica of the same age and sex, and in the same class as our cases as a control group.
Both groups were evaluated for iron deficiency anaemia.
Among the 57 students (6.7%) who had pica, there was no significant relationship with sex (P > 0.05).
The most common types of pica were soil (62.3%) and paper (31.2%).
The frequency of anaemia among cases was greater than in controls, although the difference was not statistically significant.
The serum iron/total iron binding capacity ratio ≤ 0.15 did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
We did not find any association between pica and anaemia and/or iron deficiency (P > 0.05).


Abstract
Disease and treatment-related factors associated with tuberculosis treatment default in Khartoum State, Sudan: a case-control study.
Defaulting on tuberculosis (TB) treatment remains a challenge to controlling TB.
This case-control study aimed to identify determinants of treatment default among TB patients attending treatment clinics in Khartoum State from May to July 2011.
Cases were TB patients who defaulted on treatment and controls were those who completed treatment.
Of the 2727 TB patients attending the clinics, 328 (14%) had defaulted.
Of these, 185 had resumed treatment before data collection and 143 had not and were eligible as cases.
Of the 143, 27 could not be traced and 11 declined to participate.
Thus, 105 cases and 210 controls were included and interviewed.
Attention should be paid to these groups at risk of defaulting to encourage treatment adherence and continuation.


Abstract
Health labour market requirements of health professional education in Yemen.
It is important to link health professional education to the health service needs of the private and public labour market so as to meet the plans of the health sector.
Thus, the main focus of this study was to identify the present labour market requirements for the outcomes of health training institutes.
A qualitative study was carried out among mixed healthcare professionals and various stakeholders in Sana'a City, Yemen.
Six focus group discussions were formed for 42 graduates and 20 in-depth interviews were undertaken with health development partners and public and private employers.
Outcomes of the health training institutes were still below the expectations of the health labour market, and did not fill the existing gaps in English-language proficiency and clinical skills.
The survival of health professional education depends on future development to meet labour market demands through collaboration between key stakeholders, regular updating of the curriculum, and constant professional development of the teaching staff.


Abstract
Delays in diagnosis and treatment among children with cancer: Egyptian perspective.
Delayed diagnosis is one of the contributing factors to lower cure rates for cancer in low-income countries.
This was a cross-sectional study of 138 children with cancer who were treated at the Pediatric Oncology Unit, Oncology Center of Mansoura University, Egypt.
One hundred and sixteen patients were initially misdiagnosed.
The median total delay was 37 days, including median patient/parent delay of 3 days and median physician delay of 28 days.
The type of cancer significantly influenced the diagnostic delay.
We suggest implementation of continuing medical education programmes, improving access to diagnostic facilities, and facilitating referral to give priority to those with suspected cancer to shorten the time for cancer diagnosis.

Abstract
Determinants of caesarean birth on maternal demand in the Islamic Republic of Iran: a review.
The phenomenon of caesarean birth on demand has gained attention, particularly as a first caesarean birth appears to be strongly predictive of subsequent caesareans.
Identification of reasons behind caesarean birth on demand is important for planning effective interventions.
Therefore, this review reports the factors involved in the tendency of women to undergo caesarean birth, based on studies in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Several keywords including caesarean delivery, childbirth, causes, maternal request/demand, and patient choice were used to search Medline, PubMed, Ovid, Scientific Information Database, Magiran, Google and Google Scholar.
Using content analysis, the factors influencing caesarean section were divided into 3 categories: maternal, social and healthcare giver.
According to the high prevalence of caesarean section, it is important to design and implement effective programmes and interventions with consideration of the key reasons that lead women to opt for unnecessary caesarean section.


Abstract
Governing the Lebanese health system: strengthening the national response to the burden of Syrian refugees.
Lebanon is providing sanctuary to an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees, with potential consequences for its health system.
An effective response to the Syrian refugee crisis requires concerted international action.
Nonetheless, geography dictates that the Lebanese health system must play a central role.
We identify some areas where a strengthened stewardship role of the Ministry of Public Health is urgently required.
Finally, we suggest that this crisis could be a catalyst for the strengthening of the Lebanese health system, based on evidence-informed policies that would benefit refugees and the Lebanese population alike.

Abstract
Ethical and regulatory oversight of research may be suboptimal in low- and middle-income countries.
To determine patients' attitudes and perceptions toward research participation and perceptions of their rights, we recruited 202 participants from hospitals in Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Sudan and asked them to complete a questionnaire assessing attitudes and perceptions.
Over 85% believed that they should have rights regarding confidentiality of data, free medical care if injured during the research and asking questions.
Almost half believed they have a right to withdraw without penalty and around 75% believed they could make complaints without fear of harm.
Those who were illiterate or unemployed were less likely to appreciate their rights compared with their counterparts.


Abstract
Urbanization and noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors: WHO STEPwise Iranian NCD risk factors surveillance in 2011.
This study was conducted to examine the relationship between urbanization and risk factors of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) according to the World Health Organization stepwise approach to surveillance of NCDs.
This study is part of a NCD risk factor surveillance of 10 069 individuals in all provinces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, aged over 20 years, during 2011.
By utilizing 2011 census data, urbanization levels were determined in all provinces and logistics regression was used to examine the relationship between urbanization and risk factors.
Among males, urbanization had a positive correlation with low physical activity (OR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.42-2.09), low fruit and vegetable consumption (OR=1.8; 95% CI: 1.09-2.96), and high BMI (OR=1.4; 95% CI: 1.20-1.70).
Among females there was a positive and significant correlation with low physical activity (OR=1.2; 95% CI: 1.08-1.49), low fruit and vegetable consumption (OR=1.22; 95% CI: 0.78-1.91) and high BMI (OR=1.3; 95% CI: 1.14-1.53).
Thus, urbanization has a significant correlation with increases in NCD factors in the Islamic Republic of Iran.


Abstract
Implementation of a peer-mediated health education model in the United Arab Emirates: addressing risky behaviours among expatriate adolescents.
Tobacco use among young people is increasing in the United Arab Emirates, and the country is ranked 15th in the world for prevalence of type II diabetes.
Expatriates comprise a majority of the population, making them an important subset to study.
We aimed to test whether an educational intervention would be effective in this cultural setting.
Surveys were administered before and after the workshops to assess intervention effectiveness.
The nutrition and physical activity workshop resulted in decreased satisfaction with personal activity levels.
This study provides evidence to support the national adoption of a peer-to-peer health education model as an intervention for tobacco use but not for nutrition and physical activity choices.


Abstract
Prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among school-aged children in Jordan.
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms among school children in Jordan and the probable associated risk factors.
This was a crosssectional descriptive study and simple random sampling was used to select 480 students, aged 6-12 years, from government primary schools in Mafraq City, Jordan.
Data were collected using the modified Arabic version of the Attention Deficit Disorder Evaluation Scale (ADDES) school version and parental questionnaire.
Prevalence rates within the inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive and combined subtypes were 10.83, 9.58 and 20.21%, respectively.
Increased family size and being male were both associated with increased prevalence of ADHD symptoms.
The study revealed that ADHD is common among Jordanian school children.
The government should establish education programmes to increase awareness of ADHD.


Abstract
Prevalence and preventability of sentinel events in Saudi Arabia: analysis of reports from 2012 to 2015.
This study aimed to assess the pattern of sentinel events reported to Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia from January 2012 to June 2015.
Sentinel event reports were examined for patient characteristics, type of event, outcome, cause and preventability.
There were 433 sentinel events: 58.2% were deaths, 14.8% were unexpected loss of a limb or a function, 7.4% major medication errors and 7.4% retained instruments or sponges.
Among the reported events, 44% were associated with surgical interventions and most were classified as preventable (91.6%).
Age 19-64 years was significantly associated with death as an outcome (P = 0.02).
Non-preventable sentinel events were significantly more likely among women than men (P = 0.01).
Unavailability of policy and procedures and/ or failure to implement them (55%), and lack of proper communication (35%) and training (33%) were the main causes for the adverse events.
Efforts should focus on enhancing the National Sentinel Events Reporting System, adopting criteria for effective reporting and ensuring availability and implementation of policies and procedures.


Abstract
Health-related quality of life of patients with asthma: a cross-sectional study in Semnan, Islamic Republic of Iran.
Asthma can profoundly affect the quality of life of individuals with the disease.
There are limited data on the quality of life of people with asthma in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate quality of life in adults with asthma in Semnan using the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36).
The effect of sociodemographic characteristics on quality of life scores was examined.
The study included a convenience sample of 385 outpatients with asthma attending a pulmonary clinic from June to December 2013.
The mean physical and mental component scores were 58.8 (SD 18.3) and 57.3 (SD 17.0) respectively.
The study sample had lower quality of life scores in all the fields than the reference population (P < 0.05).
Patients with lower education, urban residents, widowed/divorced patients and manual workers had lower quality of life scores (P < 0.05).
Efforts are needed to improve the quality of life of people with asthma in parallel with precise management plans.


Abstract
Epidemiological characteristics and trends in the incidence of animal bites in Maku County, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2003-2012.
This study examined the epidemiological characteristics and incidence over time of animal bites in Maku County.
Data were obtained from health centre records of animal bites from 2003 to 2012.
Information on demographic characteristics and bite-related factors were recorded.
Most bites were to the legs and feet (65%) and dogs were responsible for 92% of bites.
Over 25% of those bitten delayed seeking care for more than a day, particularly rural residents.
The mean incidence was 250 per 100 000 population and there was a statistically significant increasing linear trend over the 10-year period.
There is a need to raise public awareness, especially among rural residents, of the importance of early treatment.
Given the increasing trend in animal bites, a health policy to tackle this problem is needed.


Abstract
Reprocessing practices for gastrointestinal endoscopes: a multicentre study in Egyptian university hospitals.
The aim of this study was to assess the practices of health care workers during gasterointestinal endoscope reprocessing, evaluate their knowledge about reprocessing, and verify their compliance with laboratory and microbiological tests in endoscopy units at Zagazig University and Fayoum University hospitals.
All nursing staff on duty from 10 endoscopy units, with 16 flexible endoscopes, were included.
Knowledge and practice were assessed by a questionnaire and a checklist.
The mean knowledge score was 7.5 (SD 1.9), which was poor.
Compliance was 90% for disinfection and 74% for endoscope processing after disinfection.
Before reuse after cleaning, no organisms were detected in 5 endoscopes, while 8 colony forming units were found in 2.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common organism isolated.
Strict implementation of the reprocessing guidelines are needed, especially the pre-cleaning stage and leak testing.
Repeating high level disinfection after storage and before use must be followed.

Abstract
In recent years, a wide range of diagnostic tests has become available for use in resource-constrained settings.
Accordingly, a huge number of guidelines, performance evaluations and implementation reports have been produced.
Gaps in the information needed to complete these six steps and gaps in regulatory systems are highlighted.
Finally, ways of improving the quality of diagnostic tests are suggested, such as establishing a model list of essential diagnostics, establishing a repository of information on the design of diagnostic studies and improving quality control and postmarketing surveillance.


Abstract
Anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and others) are the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and are associated with a high burden of illness.
Anxiety disorders are often underrecognized and undertreated in primary care.
Treatment is indicated when a patient shows marked distress or suffers from complications resulting from the disorder.
The treatment recommendations given in this article are based on guidelines, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews of randomized controlled studies.
Anxiety disorders should be treated with psychological therapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both.
Cognitive behavioral therapy can be regarded as the psychotherapy with the highest level of evidence.
First-line drugs are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.
Benzodiazepines are not recommended for routine use.
Other treatment options include pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, buspirone, moclobemide, and others.
After remission, medications should be continued for 6 to 12 months.
When developing a treatment plan, efficacy, adverse effects, interactions, costs, and the preference of the patient should be considered.


Abstract
From the 19th century into the 20th century, the terms used to diagnose generalized anxiety included "pantophobia" and "anxiety neurosis."
Such terms designated paroxysmal manifestations (panic attacks) as well as interparoxysmal phenomenology (the apprehensive mental state).
Also, generalized anxiety was considered one of numerous symptoms of neurasthenia, a vaguely defined illness.
Thus, a cognitive aspect of anxiety has become the core criterion of GAD.
The validity of GAD as an independent category has been questioned from DSM-III up to preparation of DSM-5.
Areas of concern have included the difficulty to establish clear boundaries between GAD and (i) personality dimensions, (ii) other anxiety-spectrum disorders, and (iii) nonbipolar depression.
The National Institute of Mental Health has recently proposed the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a framework destined to facilitate biological research into the etiology of mental symptoms.
Within the RDoC framework, generalized anxiety might be studied as a dimension denominated "anxious apprehension" that would typically fit into the research domain called "negative valence systems" and the more specific construct termed "potential threat."


Abstract
Cultural factors have influenced the presentation, diagnoses, and treatment of anxiety disorders in India for several centuries.
This review covers the antecedents, prevalence, phenomenology, and treatment modalities of anxiety disorders in the Indian cultural context.
It covers the history of the depiction of anxiety in India and the concept of culture in the classification of anxiety disorders, and examines the cultural factors influencing anxiety disorders in India.
We review the prevalence and phenomenology of various disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, and phobic disorder, as well as culture-specific syndromes such as dhat and koro in India.
Finally, the review examines the wide range of therapeutic modalities practiced in India, such as faith healing, psychotherapy, ayurveda, psychopharmacology, Unani medicine, homeopathy, yoga, meditation, and mindfulness.
We conclude by emphasizing the significance of cultural factors in making relevant diagnoses and offering effective and holistic treatments to individuals with anxiety disorders.


Abstract
On the basis of epidemiological survey findings, anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders around the world and are associated with significant comorbidity and morbidity.
Such surveys rely on advances in psychiatric nosology and may also contribute usefully to revisions of the nosology.
There are a number of questions at the intersection of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology.
This review addresses the following: What is the prevalence of anxiety disorders and how do we best explain cross-national differences in prevalence estimates?
What are the optimal diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders, and how can epidemiological data shed light on this question?
What are the comorbidities of anxiety disorders, and how do we best understand the high comorbidities seen in these conditions?
What is the current treatment gap for anxiety disorders, and what are the implications of current understandings of psychiatric epidemiology and nosology for policy-making relevant to anxiety disorders?
Here, we emphasize that anxiety disorders are the most prevalent of the psychiatric conditions, and that rather than merely contrasting cross-national prevalence in anxiety disorders, it is more productive to delineate cross-national themes that emerge about the epidemiology of these conditions.
We discuss that optimizing diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders is an iterative process to which epidemiological data can make a crucial contribution.
Additionally, high comorbidity in anxiety disorders is not merely artefactual; it provides key opportunities to explore pathways to mental disorders and to intervene accordingly.
Finally, work on the epidemiology and nosology of anxiety disorders has provided a number of important targets for mental health policy and for future integrative work to move between bench and bedside, as well as between clinic and community.


Abstract
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) runs in families.
Building on recent theoretical approaches, this review focuses on potential environmental pathways for parent-to-child transmission of GAD.
First, we address child acquisition of a generalized pattern of fearful/anxious and avoidant responding to potential threat from parents via verbal information and via modeling.
Next, we address how parenting behaviors may contribute to maintenance of fearful/anxious and avoidant reactions in children.
Finally, we consider intergenerational transmission of worries as a way of coping with experiential avoidance of strong negative emotions and with intolerance of uncertainty.
Our review highlights the need for research on specific pathways for parent-to-child transmission of GAD.


Abstract
In this paper, we review the large amount of available data, and we focus in particular on evidence from neuroimaging, genetic, and neurochemical measurements in GAD in order to better understand potential biomarkers involved in its etiology and treatment.
Overall, the majority of these studies have produced results that are solitary findings, sometimes inconsistent and not clearly replicable.
For these reasons, they have not yet been translated into clinical practice.
Therefore, further research efforts are needed to distinguish GAD from other mental disorders and to provide new biological insights into its pathogenesis and treatment.


Abstract
Finally, GAD and trait anxiety research challenges and perspectives in the field of genetics, including epigenetics, are discussed.


Abstract
In this article, the authors provide an integrated review of the task-based affective fMRI literature in GAD.
Studies provide evidence for variable presence and directionality of BOLD abnormalities in limbic and prefrontal regions during reactivity to, regulation of, and learning from emotional cues.
We conclude that understanding the sources of this variability is key to accelerating progress in this area.
We propose that the cardinal symptom of GAD-worry-predominantly reflects stimulus-independent mental processes that impose abnormal, inflexible functional brain configurations, ie, the overall pattern of information transfer among behaviorally relevant neural circuits at a given point in time.
These configurations that are inflexible to change from the incoming flux of environmental stimuli may underlie inconsistent task-based findings.


Abstract
Stress is a precipitating factor for anxiety-related disorders, which are among the leading forms of psychiatric illness and impairment in the modern world.
Rodent-based behavioral tests and models are widely used to understand the mechanisms by which stress triggers anxiety-related behaviors and to identify new treatments for anxiety-related disorders.
The purpose of this article is to describe methods that have been historically used for this type of research and to highlight new approaches that align with recent conceptualizations of disease symptomatology and that may ultimately prove to be more fruitful in facilitating the development of improved therapeutics.


Abstract
Social anxiety is a form of anxiety characterized by continuous fear of one or more social or performance situations.
Although multiple treatment modalities (cognitive behavioral therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors/selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines) exist for social anxiety, they are effective for only 60% to 70% of patients.
Thus, researchers have looked for other candidates for social anxiety treatment.
Animal research both in nonprimates and primates supports oxytocin's role in facilitation of prosocial behaviors and its anxiolytic effects.
Human studies indicate significant associations between social anxiety and oxytocin receptor gene alleles, as well as social anxiety and oxytocin plasma levels.
The therapeutic role of oxytocin for social dysfunction in these disorders is discussed.


Abstract
As a form of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is more than a mere "toolbox."
At the beginning, the
In the last few years, GAD theories have evolved, becoming more precise about the cognitive functioning of GAD sufferers.
Here, we look at current theoretical models and the main techniques of therapeutic care, as well as the advances in research about the "transdiagnostic" process and GAD in childhood.
CBT is an effective treatment for GAD, typically leading to reductions in worry, and a study has shown that such therapy is equal to pharmaceutical treatment and more effective 6 months after study completion.

Abstract
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease.
Transmission occurs from person to person through direct contact or by aerosolization of pharyngeal secretions.
In the area of Verviers (Belgium), we were confronted to a group of patients with measles, a public health event with local concentration.
In our hospital institution, our case index dates back to the beginning of February 2017 and the follow-up of the cases indicates an upward trajectory.
Sorting measures and isolations of potential patients, extensive screening and vaccinations were undertaken and coordinated from an internal management unit.
Numerous contacts have been made with the competent authorities.
The limitation of a measles epidemic remains a public health problem that is difficult to manage optimally, and a limited number of nosocomial cases and infections of hospital staff could not be avoided.


Abstract
Although well studied since the 50's, bruxism remains a largely unknown pathology.
Its origin is complex, mixing psychological as well as neurological, odontological and hypnic aspects.
However, the few analyzes performed on this topic have allowed to set convincing etiopathological hypotheses, including central dysregulation of the dopaminergic system as well as of the neuro-masticatory system.
For this purpose, and in addition to anamnestic and clinical data, the practitioner can confirm diagnosis with polysomnography, including electromyographic study of masticatory muscles and audiovisual recording.
Some orthodontic, pharmacological and psychological solutions have already proved efficient.
Nevertheless, a better knowledge of causative neurobiological mechanisms would allow to foresee etiology-based treatments.

Abstract
There has been a range of developments in recent years to stimulate increasing public health research activity throughout the Pacific.
Development of local capacity for ethics committee review and oversight is, however, frequently underdeveloped.
This is reflected in the number of Pacific Island nations where ethics committees have not been established or where only informal processes exist for ethics review and oversight.
This is problematic for the optimal development of relevant and culturally appropriate research, and building up local ethics committees should be part of continued research development in the Pacific.
This article considers benefits and challenges for ethics committees in the Pacific, and suggests directions for regional development to further strengthen public health research activity.


Abstract
What place is there for holy play in experience-oriented society?
Is it possible and useful to make analytic distinctions between the liturgical quality of events?
I explored these questions by doing research on the boundaries between the religious field and the field of leisure.
Fifty site visits to public events in the Netherlands (2006-2014) resulted in a collection of ethnographic data.
I used the concept of play as introduced by the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga and the tools of ritual studies to explore whether these could help to produce an account of the liturgical quality of ritualized meetings.
Holy play might be found in unexpected places, such as in a bingo hall.

Abstract
Economics is one of the tools they have to aid their decision-making.
It can enable them to make objective decisions based on the expected costs and benefits of their policy.
In addition, economics can help them determine both the distribution impact and the indirect impact of their decisions.
However, economics is only one of many tools available to policy-makers, who also need to consider non-economic outcomes in their decision-making process.
While there are sophisticated epidemic and economic (epinomic) models that are available to help evaluate complex problems, these models typically require extensive data and well-trained analysts to run and interpret their results.
In addition, effective communication between analysts and policy-makers is important to ensure that results are clearly conveyed to the policy-makers.
This may be facilitated by early and continued discussions between these two potentially disparate groups.


Abstract
In Albania, Brucella abortus and B. melitensis affect humans, cattle and small ruminants.
In the United States, B. abortus affects cattle and wild ungulates in the Greater Yellowstone Area.
Government regulations and mitigation strategies should be designed with consideration of all costs and benefits, both to public agencies and private stakeholders.
Policy-makers should, for example, weigh the benefits of a regulation that increases epidemiological certainty against the costs of compliance for producers and households.
The distribution of costs and benefits amongst public agencies and private individuals can have important implications for a policy's economic efficiency and equity quite apart from their total magnitude.

Abstract
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was first detected in 2011 in Germany and then in France in 2012.
A partial budget is used to evaluate the financial effect of incremental changes, and includes only resources or production that will be changed.
In the high-impact scenario, the estimated impact of SBV ranged from €23 to €43 per cow per year and €19 to €37 per ewe per year.
These financial impacts represent 0.6% to 63% of the gross margin, depending on the chosen scenario and the livestock system being considered.
The impacts of SBV come mainly from: the extra costs from purchasing and raising replacement heifers and losses in milk production (dairy cows); the losses in calf or lamb production (beef systems and meat sheep); and the losses in milk production and from unsold replacement lambs (dairy sheep).
The use of integrated production and economic models enabled the authors to estimate the cost of SBV and to tackle the problem of scarce data, which is a difficulty for most emerging diseases, by their very nature.
It also allowed the authors to develop an accurate disease impact assessment for several production systems, over a short time span.
Extrapolating from this economic assessment to predict the scenario in coming years depends on the immunity period of the disease and the length of the production cycles.


Abstract
The economic impact of peste des petits ruminants in India.
However, data on the incidence of PPR are limited and scant literature is available on the economic losses caused by the disease.
In the present study, a structured sampling design was adopted, which covered the major agro-climatic regions of the country, to ascertain the morbidity and mortality rates of PPR.
Available estimates of the economic losses in India due to various livestock diseases are based on single values of various epidemiological and economic parameters.
Stochastic modelling was used to estimate the economic impact of PPR.
Overall annual morbidity and mortality rates of PPR for small ruminants in India have been estimated from the sample as being 8%and 3.45%, respectively.
The authors have analysed variations in these rates across species, age group, sex, season and region.
The expected annual economic loss due to PPR in India ranges from as little as US $2 million to $18 million and may go up to US $1.5 billion; the most likely range of expected economic losses is between US $653 million and $669 million.
This study thus reveals significant losses due to the incidence of PPR in small ruminants in India.


Abstract
To be effective, the results from economic analysis need to be applied by decision-makers.


Abstract
Generic frameworks for the economic analysis of farm animal disease are now well established.
Such analyses in turn raise interesting questions about farmer uptake and maintenance of certification schemes and the equity and cost-effective implementation of these schemes.
The complex epidemiology of BVD virus infections and the long-term, widespread and often occult nature of BVD effects make economic analysis of the disease and its control particularly challenging.
However, this has resulted in a wider whole-farm perspective that captures the influence of multiple decisions, not just those directly associated with disease prevention and control.
There is a need to include management of reproduction, risk and enterprise mix in the research on farmer decision-making, as all these factors impinge on, and are affected by, the spread of BVD.


Abstract
A large part of the world's resources are used to produce animal products.
Efficient use of these resources is important to improve social well-being.
The optimal level of production with and without disease differs from farm to farm and depends on varying economic circumstances.
Given these difficulties, making an accurate theoretical estimation of the economic impact of endemic diseases is challenging.
Current approaches towards the economic assessment of endemic diseases are, therefore, quite pragmatic.
For on-farm decision-making, the total costs consist of failure costs and preventive costs.
Failure costs are associated with production losses (i.e. decreases in milk production, mortality and culling), treatment costs (i.e. veterinary treatment, drugs, and discarded milk) and the use of other resources associated with the occurrence of disease (i.e. increased labour costs).
Preventive costs are associated with preventive measures in terms of equipment, consumables (e.g. diagnostics and chemicals) and the use of other resources to prevent diseases (i.e. increased labour).
There is a substitution relationship between failure costs and preventive costs.
That means that, in order to maximise profit at the farm level, the amount of resources invested in prevention should be chosen in such a way that total costs are minimised.
The most studied endemic disease in animal production is mastitis.
Most publications on mastitis only assess failure costs, and studies on assessing the total costs and best methods to determine an optimal level of prevention are scarce.
Future challenges lie in researching frameworks that can assist decision-makers to establish optimal prevention levels for endemic diseases.


Abstract
A large-scale foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Japan in 2010 caused severe economic losses for livestock and related industries.
In this paper, the authors develop a clear and usable framework to estimate the economic impact of this FMD outbreak.
An economic analysis is then conducted by combining this framework with an epidemiological model.
The framework estimates the direct and indirect costs to livestock and related industries by applying an input-output model, as well as by addressing expenditure on disease control.
The direct cost to the livestock industry was estimated at 51.2 billion Japanese yen (JPY), engendering an indirect cost to related industries of JPY 25.5 billion.
The expenditure for disease control activities was estimated at JPY 8.2 billion.
The total impact of the 2010 FMD epidemic was estimated at almost JPY 85 billion.
Prompt culling and early detection were superior from an economic point of view, reducing the total economic impact to 30% and 2% of that in the baseline scenario, respectively.
Compared with these scenarios, vaccination was less cost effective.
However, vaccination suppressed the speed of disease spread and shortened the duration of the epidemic, suggesting its potential effectiveness in curbing rapid disease spread in a densely populated area.


Abstract
A framework for policy analysis was adapted for this review.
The data and information used to search for evidence of the problem, options for solving the problem, and the projected outcomes of those options were obtained from both published and grey sources of literature.
The policy problem for CBPP control in sub-Saharan Africa was identified as a failure to deliver control services to farmers whose cattle are at high risk of exposure to infection.
The authors suggest the adoption of signed contractual agreements between the public and private sectors to support the vaccination of susceptible herds raised in endemic regions.
Implementation of this policy will increase vaccination coverage of susceptible cattle herds since current vaccination coverage is low.


Abstract
Based on data from publications and field observations, this study analyses the interactions between animal health, rural poverty and the performance and environmental impact of livestock farming in low-income countries and middle-income countries.
There are strong statistical correlations between the quality of Veterinary Services, livestock productivity and poverty rates.
In countries with effective Veterinary Services, livestock growth stems mainly from productivity gains and poverty rates are the lowest.
Conversely, these analyses identify no statistical link between the quality of Veterinary Services and increased livestock production volumes.
However, where animal diseases are poorly controlled, productivity is low and livestock growth is extensive, based mainly on a steady increase in animal numbers.
Extensive growth is less effective than intensive growth in reducing poverty and aggravates the pressure of livestock production on natural resources and the climate.


Abstract
Other risk analysis methodologies and approaches are also employed, which focus on animal and human health within countries and communities.
Based on an analysis of evaluations conducted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), using the Performance of Veterinary Services Tool, the authors attempt to define current practice in Africa and degrees of compliance with the World Trade Organization Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures ('SPS Agreement') and OIE standards.
To assist in this task, the authors also make use of a review of selected risk assessment reports.
This is confirmed by a number of case studies, half of which have been produced by international consultants.


Abstract
The impact of disease in people is conventionally quantified in non-monetary terms, usually a disability-adjusted life year (DALY), whereas the losses due to disease in animals, particularly livestock, are quantified in monetary terms.
The potential for the development of a non-monetary metric for ill health in animals, based on life years lost and disability, is discussed and rejected.
Within and across animal species and livestock production systems, maximising life spans is not a consistent goal and morbidity/disabilities have very different weights and often lead to culling.
By relating livestock losses to a measure of national income forgone, the recently developed alternative of converting monetary losses due to livestock illness into an animal loss equivalent (ALE) provides a viable solution.
Based on this, the literature on the economics of controlling zoonoses is revisited and four options for quantifying and comparing benefits and costs are examined and illustrated using numerical examples.
These are i) the simplistic grouping of all monetary elements and their comparison to DALYs averted (described as the aggregate net cost method), ii) the separable costs method, iii) the use of ALEs to convert all benefits to a non-monetary equivalent, termed the zoonotic DALY (zDALY), or iv) the use of a full monetary cost-benefit analysis, based on converting DALYs to a monetary equivalent.
The strengths and weaknesses of each are discussed.
For effective prioritisation and decision-making, it is vital that an analytical approach is widely adopted which yields consistent results and which supports the control of zoonoses.


Abstract
For instance, the economic consequences of alternative vaccination strategies to mitigate a disease can vary in magnitude due to trade embargoes and other factors.
The authors discuss the economic measurement of animal disease outbreaks and interventions and how measurement is used in private and public decision-making.


Abstract
This paper examines four examples of animal welfare issues, demonstrating the interactions between welfare and economic principles.
The livestock industry is presented from the point of view of pig production and the impact that a major disease (pleurisy) has on production and the animals' welfare.
The authors investigate the conflicting and complementary demands of animal welfare and economic gains during the transport and slaughter of livestock and poultry.
Also included in this example are decisions made about cost effectiveness and opportunity costs, and regulatory and financial barriers to the development of humane control agents.
In conclusion, animal welfare is illustrated as a central factor in the benefits that humans enjoy from the role played by animals in society.
There are, however, tradeoffs between optimal animal welfare and meeting the needs of modern human society.


Abstract
A brief history of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and its control in Great Britain (GB) is presented.
This increase appeared to coincide with changing policy regarding the control of the disease in badgers, with a more humane approach adopted and with strengthened protection for badgers through legislation.
Indeed, there has been much controversy in the debate on the role of badgers in disease transmission to cattle and the need for their control as vectors of the disease.
The issue has attracted the attention of the media and there have been various commissioned research projects, trials and public consultations.


Abstract
To illustrate some of the challenges, it draws on the experience of including health measures in the most recent (2015) agricultural MACCs in the United Kingdom.


Abstract
However, empirical studies show that food markets are often imperfect, with anomalies or asymmetries in price transmission and distortions in the distribution of market benefits.
Market concentration and the consequent exertion of market power in key segments of the supply chain can explain price transmission asymmetries and their distributional effects, but other factors may also be involved, such as transaction costs, scale economies, and imperfect information.
During the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, asymmetric price transmission in the beef supply chain and related meat markets determined distributional effects among sectors.


Abstract
Infectious animal diseases can spill across farm boundaries, so effective management requires coordinated responses.
The article concludes with comments and suggestions on tackling infectious disease as a public good, and on directions for future research.


Abstract
Economics provides a framework for understanding management decisions and their policy implications for the animal health system.
While the neoclassical economic model is useful for framing animal health decisions on the farm, some of its assumptions and prescriptive results may be unrealistic.
Institutional and behavioural economics address some of these potential shortcomings by considering the role of information, psychology and social factors in decisions.
Framing such decisions under contract theory allows us to consider asymmetric information between policy-makers and farmers.
Perverse incentives may exist in the area of preventing and reporting disease.
Behavioural economics examines the role of internal and external psychological and social factors.
Framing choices and providing relevant information and examples can alleviate these behavioural issues.
The implications of this approach for disease policy and an applied research and outreach programme to respond to animal diseases are discussed.


Abstract
The primary role of animal health economics is to inform decision-making by determining optimal investments for animal health.
Animal health surveillance produces information to guide interventions.
Consequently, investments in surveillance and intervention must be evaluated together.
The authors present frameworks that define the relationship between health investment and losses due to disease, and the relationship between surveillance and intervention resources.
The authors also discuss approaches used to quantify externalities and non-monetary impacts.
Finally, they describe common economic evaluation types, including optimisation, acceptability and least-cost studies.


Abstract
In this paper, the authors detail the structure and optimal management of health systems as influenced by the presence and level of fixed costs.
Unlike variable costs, fixed costs cannot be altered, and are thus independent of the level of veterinary activity in the short run.
Their importance is illustrated by using both single-period and multi-period models.
It is shown that multi-stage veterinary decision-making can often be envisaged as a sequence of fixed-cost problems.
The authors also assess the extent to which it pays to reduce fixed costs and to try to compensate for this by increasing variable costs.
Fixed costs have major implications for the industrial structure of the animal health products industry and for the structure of the private veterinary services industry.
In the former, they favour market concentration and specialisation in the supply of products.
In the latter, they foster increased specialisation.
While cooperation by individual farmers may help to reduce their individual fixed costs, the organisational difficulties and costs involved in achieving this cooperation can be formidable.
In such cases, the only solution is government provision of veterinary services.
Moreover, international cooperation may be called for.
Fixed costs also influence the nature of the provision of veterinary education.


Abstract
Economics is too important to be left to the experts.
This paper is therefore mainly for animal health policy-makers who are not economists but want a better appreciation of how economics can contribute to resource allocation decisions.
First, the methodology of economic analysis is outlined with the objective of dispelling criticisms of its simplifying assumption of rationality.
Then, unusual in economics but more familiar to biological and veterinary scientists, the technical aspects of transforming resources into products are discussed.
Economics' unique contribution is to establish criteria enabling society to obtain maximum value from the production and distribution of goods and services (products) from scarce resources.
Animal disease reduces the efficiency of this process.
Animal products, and so implicitly animals themselves, are an example.
The strength of people's preferences is reflected both in the prices they pay for market goods and services, and by their political votes where markets do not exist.
Importantly, there is a difference between financial value (what the consumer pays for a good or service) and economic value (the maximum amount of money they would be prepared to pay for it).
Allocating resources for animal health creates both costs and benefits, financial and economic.
Moreover, costs and benefits are both private and social because of externalities, a major consideration in infectious diseases.


Abstract
Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important transboundary disease in South-East Asia.
Its control has been a priority in the region for at least 20 years, with extensive institutional support and capacity-building being provided by the international community through the World Organisation for Animal Health.
Significant progress has been made, and the strategy for eradication is now both clearly understood and feasible in the Mekong.
However, FMD control in this region requires more than just an effective vaccination strategy and regulatory support.
Success will also depend on obtaining consensus and buy-in at all levels of the value chain, from input suppliers to consumers.
Culturally and economically acceptable incentives must be in place to ensure that control measures are implemented, and those stakeholders who are expected to bear the risk and costs of control programmes must also be the main beneficiaries.
The present institutional environment in the Mekong, and in particular in Cambodia, makes control and eradication of transboundary diseases difficult.
Further work is required to ensure that control strategies are aligned with stakeholder needs and priorities, and actively improve smallholder welfare.
Cattle producers and traders are crucial to the control of FMD in Cambodia.
Economic incentives and education as well as regulation are required to ensure these stakeholders participate in this important transboundary disease eradication programme.


Abstract
A modified inclinometer was designed for measuring total ankle range of motion (ROM) in the standing position for a large future study.
Nineteen young healthy individuals took part in the pilot.
The same examiner took the ROM measurements using both devices twice on the same day and one further time 2 or 3 days later.
Test-retest reliability was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
The ICC values were 0.86 (95% CI=[0.67; 0.94]) and 0.83 (95% CI=[0.61; 0.93]) for the measurements taken with the goniometer on the same day and for those on two different days.
The corresponding values for the modified inclinometer were 0.88 (95% CI=[0.72;0.95]) and 0.81 (95% CI=[0.57; 0.92]).
Both instruments were found to have very good test-retest reliability.

Published case studies involving diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) along with symptomatic ossification of the stylohyoid ligament, or "Eagle syndrome," are rare.
The key imaging and clinical features of this disorder are also described.


Abstract
Common bile duct (CBD) injury is the most serious complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Recently, laparoscopic techniques have been used in the management of postoperative bile leak and CBD injury; this literature has not been reviewed.
We combined this review with our experience in laparoscopic methods to highlight diagnostic and therapeutic options.
Laparoscopic techniques can be used to prevent, diagnose and treat CBD injuries.
Intraoperatively, CBD injury can be prevented in the case of short cystic duct with the use of a loop ligature or transfixing suture, and it can be diagnosed using intraoperative cholangiography or other visualization techniques.
When CBD injury is suspected postoperatively, repeat laparoscopy can be used to control sepsis with abdominal washout; as a diagnostic tool to guide management; and, in some settings, as a therapeutic tool for suturing small duct leaks, drain insertion and postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with sphincterotomy.
Definitive laparoscopic repair is possible when certain criteria are met.
Open surgery should be considered when the CBD is small, the injury occurred more than 72 hours previously, injury or anatomy are complex, port positioning is awkward for repair, or local experience is limited with laparoscopic management.
There is an emerging role for laparoscopy in the management of CBD injuries.
More case reports and series are needed to show the safety and efficacy of this technique, encourage its wider adoption, and allow outcomes assessment on a larger scale.

These approaches allow to better address special needs of AWID.


Abstract
The possibility to recover from a psychiatric disorder for example schizophrenia materializes today by the emergence of new professionals : peer support workers.
This brief article provides an update while they begin to be active in French-speaking Switzerland.
The data indicate that their involvement in care decreases the use of emergency, enhances the capability of persons to manage their own health and the satisfaction towards psychiatric services.
They promote a culture of hope and recovery in other professionals.
Studies are necessary to evaluate more precisely these complex interventions.

Abstract
Vaccination is a major stake of primary prevention but is increasingly weakened by its own success.
The emergence of a category of patients known as « hesitant », largely influenced by mass media, jeopardizes future immunization coverage.
In this paper, we suggest some communication tools to help physicians deal with their « hesitant » patients.

Abstract
Balance requires the modulation and integration of multiple sensory information, among which the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear plays an essential role.
While these adaptive capacities have the advantage of allowing all kinds of activities, they also have the disadvantage of producing various sensations, sometimes very strange.
Enormous progress has been made recently in the investigation of vestibular disorders.
However, given the complexity of the system, it must be admitted that many elements remain to be discovered.
In the meantime, let us avoid considering the 'bizarre' phenomena that some patients report as the expression of a psychological disorder !


Abstract
A retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus located behind the posterior pharyngeal wall.
Main symptoms include torticoli, pyrexia and odynodysphagia.
This article presents a clinical case with literature review.


Abstract
A century and a half after its first description, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) has revealed only part of its secrets.
Its definition remains clinical since the imaging technology we have at our dis-posal is insufficiently sensitive and specific.
Next to its idiopathic form, the most frequent and the most characteristic, there are numerous situations inducing a functional limitation of the glenohumeral joint and of its environment.
The clinical course inexorably takes place in one to two years, and develops in 3 phases where successively pain, retraction, and then recovery, as a rule complete recovery, dominate.
No treatment is likely to shorten it.
In the absence of clearly established proof, our therapeutic approach must be prudent and conservative.


Abstract
The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a frequent and increasing disease in Western countries.
Psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression or anxiety, are often observed and have a major impact on the quality of life and on the prognosis of the patients.
Several models based on physiopathological and behavioral psychotherapy researches help us to understand this association between somatic and psychiatric disease.
The detection and the treatment of these comorbidities are challenges for the practitioner and make a multidisciplinary approach recommended.
This article aims to summarize the current state of the knowledge in this domain and to present to the practitioners the various pharmacological and psychotherapeutic options.


Abstract
The evaluation of the development of young children had to consider the possible detection of neurodevelopmental disorders in particular autism spectrum disorders.


Abstract
Indeed, it differs from adult depression by some aspects as the absence of depressive experience.
It is a major risk factor for suicide, dropping out of school and social isolation.
We will identify the specific clinical signs to make a diagnosis in children and adolescents and to identify therapeutic approaches.
On the other hand, we will try to highlight the risk factors of depression.


Abstract
The basic examination of a dizzy patient implies the assessment of these different aspects.
It is a distinctive expression of the sixth sense : the sense of orientation.
So, the ability of self-orientation in space is a primitive, unconscious function, critical to stay alive and closely related to the limbic system.
The experience of the mobility, that required the spatial memory, which evolved towards the episodic memory, could be considered as the foundation of our thought.

Abstract
Reagent strip urinalysis is a very simple and affordable way to detect proteinuria.
This mean, however efficient, generally requires further laboratory analysis of an early morning urine sample, as readily available.
Lately, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) has largely taken over other detection methods by its precision and ability to foreshow earlier stages of diabetic nephropathy.


Abstract
The objective was to increase nephro-protection measures, reduce patient morbidity and mortality, and delay admission on dialysis.
These workshops are conducted by a health professional together with a patient partner recruited by our team according to the model developed by the faculty of medicine at the University of Montreal.
This patient partnership (PP) may also be implemented in teaching and research.
In health care services, patient partners with a resource profile are involved not only in the organization of these services, but also in the development and management of health care political programs.
The PP model currently developed in the Nephrology Department is part of the Quality project of our academic hospital and helps to further the co-construction of future health care networks.


Abstract
despite fluctuations, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis has significantly increased during the last decades in industrialized nations worldwide (1 to 15 %), which has a significant impact on the cost of healthcare.
This increased prevalence is mainly explained by diet modifications.
Environmental, metabolic and genetic factors may also influence the formation of kidney stones.
As a consequence, the medical management of this disease is preferentially multidisciplinary and involves urologists, nephrologists, radiologists, biologists and dietitians.
Urological management : may be mandatory during any acute and/or remote phase of an episode of renal colic, in case of residual stones.
Several techniques are available: insertion of double J stent, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy (flexible or rigid), percutaneous nephrolithotomy and more occasionally, open surgery.
Moreover, given the high rate of recurrence (about 50 % within 5 to 10 years), individualized secondary prevention measures are necessary.
The recommendations should take into account the identified risk factors and any metabolic abnormalities.


Abstract
Lung cancer screening corresponds to any investigation carried out to detect the presence of this type of cancer before the appearance of any symptomatology.
According to the results of a large multicenter study in the US (NLST), American scientific societies are currently recommending the use of the CT Thoracic Scanner with a low dose of irradiation once a year for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations.
European expert groups, for the most part, reserve their recommendations after publication of the results of a major European study (NELSON).
As a corollary of screening campaigns, the management of lung nodules is likely to be more and more frequent in the targeted populations.
This can be performed in different ways ranging from the less invasive, the CT Scanner follow-up, to the more invasive, the surgical resection.
The endoscopic approach of the pulmonary nodule, whose results were so far limited, is actually regaining interest due to the contribution of new technologies in bronchial endoscopy.


Abstract
Lower respiratory tract infections represent one of the main causes of mortality in the world.
They essentially consist of bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary diseases (COPD) and acute pneumonia.
If acute bronchitis is mainly of viral origin, acute exacerbations of COPD and pneumonia are mainly due to a trio of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis).
Other pathogens as many viruses and atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella, some Enterobacteriaceae and very rarely Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also implicated.
S. pneumoniae is the pathogen associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality and empirical antibiotic treatment should always be active on this germ.
According to the type of infection and factors of comorbidity, empirical antibiotic treatment should cover a number of other pathogens.
Beta-lactams, associated or not with macrolides/azalides are the first line treatment.
Fluoroquinolones, although highly active against all pathogens, must be used only in restricted situations in order to avoid emergence of resistance to these antibiotics.


Abstract
In addition to secretion disorders, tumors, secreting or not, can take place in adrenal glands.
Incidentalomas are the most common adrenal diseases in clinical practice.
The challenge of the management is to determine whether the lesion is benign or malignant and secreting or not in order to direct therapeutic management towards surgical option, pharmacotherapy or clinical follow-up.
Several radiographic characteristics allow to predict the benign or malignant nature of a lesion (size and density of the tumor, fat content,...).
Adrenal carcinoma is a very rare cancer but should be excluded because its extremely poor prognosis.
If most incidentalomas are non-secreting, it is important to ensure that there is no Cushing syndrome, even subclinical (± 10 % of incidentalomas) or pheochromocytoma (± 10 % of incidentalomas), pathologies associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular complications.
Careful clinical evaluation for symptoms and signs related to excessive adrenal hormones production is recommended to prescribe appropriate hormone assays.
Finally, the surgical indication will be guided by the probability of malignancy, the presence and the degree of hypersecretion but also the age, the general health and the choice of the patient.


Abstract
The hypercalcemia is defined as a blood calcium range above 2.6 mmol/l.
Its prevalence is variable in different studies and it is comprised between 2 and 8/1000 in the general population.
The primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) and cancers are both responsible for about 80 per cent to 90 per cent of causes of hypercalcemia1.
The PHP is the first ambulatory cause of hypercalcemia.
Contrarily to this, the neoplastic etiology is mainly seen in the hospital settings.
The other causes of the hypercalcemia are vitamin D overdose, secondary hypercalcemia due to medications intake and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia which will be discussed in this article.
The hypocalcemia is defined as a blood calcium range underneath 2.2 mmol/l.
The most common etiologies are the postoperative hypopara-thyroidism as a complication of approximatively 1.5 % of thyroidectomies2, the vitamin D deficiency and terminal chronic kidney failure.
The other rare causes such as autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, parathyroid agenesis, pseudoparathyroidism and hypomagnesemia will be discussed in this article.


Abstract
[Hyperthyroidism in family medecine].
Their diagnosis and their treatment are accessible to the general practitioner in the any great majority of the cases.

The treatment of first intention are betablockers.
This screening is simple and little invasive, it consists of the annual dosage of the TSH.


Abstract
In February 2016, the pre CT replaced the diabetic passport.
It concerns patients with dietary or oral antidiabetic treatment and provides reimbursement of dietary and podological visits.
Since July 2016, a new diabetes convention has been established.
The novelty is that it allows the financing of a new continuous glucose measurement equipment for patients with type 1 diabetes or total loss of endocrine function of the pancreas.


Abstract
There is a linear relationship between LDLcholesterol plasma concentration and coronary events, both in patients with stable angina pectoris and after an acute event.
Statins increase slightly the risk of type II diabetes in subjects at risk.


Abstract
During the last decade, life expectancy increased in western countries.
Among the elderly, cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of death.
In both genders, cardiovascular risk increases with age.
Clinical studies have shown the clinical benefit of statin therapy, both in terms of cardio-vascular events and survival in the elderly population.
The use of statins in elderly patients can currently be recommended for secondary prevention.
In primary prevention, there are less available evidences of effectiveness, statin therapy can be conside-red according to the other risk factors and the life expectancy of the patients.

In this article will be detailed the novelties in terms of cataract surgery and refractive surgery.


Abstract
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by lobular inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, and may be associated with liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis and its complications as hepatocarcinoma.
Structured programmes aimed at lifestyle changes towards healthy diet and habitual physical activity are essential in patients with NASH.


Abstract
Beyond its scientific and ethical competencies, a good doctor is characterized by his communication skills.
The ability to listen is fundamental.
During an interview, the physician must keep in mind a bio-psycho-social approach while being able to hear the unspeakable and inaudible.
Knowledge of patients and their relatives, which seems to be a specific knowledge for general practitioners, offers a lot of information.
Among the main sensitive topics that the clinician must identify are: intrafamily violence, domestic violence, substance abuse and anxiety-depressive disorders.
In order to improve, the practitioner can use tools such as the Calgary-Cambridge guide and techniques used in Motivational Maintenance.


Abstract
As with other adults, communication with elderly patients will be based on the three pillars of the person-centered approach, on motivational interviewing and on the Calgary Cambridge guide.
The particularity of communication with the elderly lies in the consideration of obstacles such as visual, auditory and cognitive deficits.
In addition, caregivers who accompany the patient sometimes monopolize the discussion, which could prevent him from expressing himself or even making decisions about his health.
Humanity and Validation are a set of tools for communicating more effectively with the very elderly or those suffering from dementia.


Abstract
Patient-doctor communication is fraught with misunderstanding and omission, especially around the drug therapy.
In this article we mobilize health anthropology to illustrate this phenomenon.
Beyond the biomedical effect, the drug is also an object of meaning: it objectifies the disease and is appealing but also raising uncertainities.
It simultaneously promises a certain autonomy and a dependency on the doctor.
Drug prescription also serves as a communication tool between the suffering patient and the caring doctor.


Abstract
The general practitioner is regularly confronted with aggressive patients.
He will have to spot the very first signs in order to manage as quickly as possible such a situation.
The ideal is to remain calm, to listen actively and to try to understand the cause of the aggressiveness, knowing that it is not always directed against the doctor.
Putting limits is also important to avoid situations that could degenerate.


Abstract
Burns are calamities with considerable morbidity and mortality rates.
About 65% of the patients were male (n=1691).
Most burns (92.8%) were less than 30% total body surface area.
Chemical burns, gas explosion burns and burn mortality increased.


Abstract
Despite a considerable decrease in their incidence worldwide, burn injuries remain one of the commonest forms of trauma and account for a weighty proportion of trauma cases in health-care emergencies around the globe.


Abstract
The World Health Organization has defined 'elderly' as 65 years or older.
Age is a known major prognostic factor after burn injury.
Regarding burn depth, deeper burns were significantly more prevalent in the over 65 group (17.1% vs. 5.0%, p=0.003).


Abstract
Infection is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among burn patients.
A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted at the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) Burn Unit between September-November 2016.
The three bacteria were only sensitive to carbapenem, aminoglycosides and tigecycline.
Carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem and doripenem) and aminoglycosides (amikacin) combination was the selected empirical therapy.


Abstract
Resistant gram negative bacteria are the most common isolates associated with burn wounds in Accra, Ghana.
Hence a careful selection of antibiotics to control the wound infection is required for proper management of burn wounds in order to help reduce morbidity and mortality.


Abstract
Inhalation injury (InI) is known to seriously affect the prognosis of burn patients, as it is strongly associated with high morbidity and mortality.
The aim of this study was to compare patients with and without InI and to identify prognostic factors among patients with smoke InI.


Abstract
The survey had a 14% response rate (284/2000).
This survival rate is significantly greater than those reported previously.


Abstract
Microalbuminuria seems to be a reflection of increased vascular permeability caused by systemic inflammatory response, and is likely to be a predictor of mortality, sepsis and other outcomes of severe burn patients.


Abstract
Simultaneous brow and lid reconstruction is one of them.


Abstract
Split skin graft (SSG) is one of the most commonly performed operations on any Plastic Surgery service.
Rate of donor site healing is affected by various factors including the type of dressing applied.
The aim of this study was to survey the practice of plastic surgeons in the sub region with respect to management of SSG donor site and see how it conforms to international standards.
Structured questionnaires on various aspects of the harvest and management of SSG donor sites were administered to plastic surgeons during the 53rd annual conference of the West African College of Surgeons (WACS) at Lome, Togo in March 2013.
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
There were 47 respondents out of 55 plastic surgeons from four West African countries, which represented 85.4% of registered participants at the plastic surgery section of the conference.
Different types of paraffin gauze remained the most commonly used primary donor site dressing.
Only 17% of the respondents apply a topical local anaesthetic agent on the donor site.
The choice of SSG donor site dressing in the sub region was driven mainly by availability.
Concerted efforts must be made to access newer wound care products for optimum management of this commonly performed operation.

Abstract
It is an aggressive, opportunistic infection that frequently progresses to involve the orbit and cerebrum.
Cerebral extension in immunocompromised patients is almost universally fatal.
There are limited data on mucormycosis in pediatric immunocompromised patients in the literature, with only few reports on rhinocerebral involvement.
In these patients, the surgical resection of mucormycosis-infected tissue followed by flap reconstruction combined with medical treatment effectively treated the infection, allowed for the rapid resumption of chemotherapy and dramatically improved the quality of life for both the patient and their family.

Abstract
Between April 1, 2011 and July 17, 2017, BBQ brush injuries were observed at a frequency of 1.5 cases per 100 000 eCHIRPP cases (N = 12).
Findings suggest that in addition to risks associated with the ingestion of loose BBQ brush bristles attached to foods, loose bristles could also result in injury via other mechanisms.


Abstract
Only 2-5% of seminal fluid is composed of spermatozoa, while the rest is seminal plasma.
The seminal plasma is a rich cocktail of organic and inorganic compounds including hormones, serving as a source of nutrients for sperm development and maturation, protecting them from infection and enabling them to overcome the immunological and chemical environment of the female reproductive tract.
In this review, a survey of the hormones found in human seminal plasma, with particular emphasis on reproductive hormones is provided.
Their participation in fertilization is discussed including their indispensable role in ovum fertilization.
The origin of individual hormones found in seminal plasma is discussed, along with differences in the concentrations in seminal plasma and blood plasma.
A part of review is devoted to methods of measurement, emphasising particular instances in which they differ from measurement in blood plasma.
These methods include separation techniques, overcoming the matrix effect and current ways for end-point measurement, focusing on so called hyphenated techniques as a combination of chromatographic separation and mass spectrometry.


Abstract
We report a case of upper extremity deep venous effort thrombosis complicating a thoracic outlet syndrome in a 44-year-old patient.
The appearance of this complication was sudden.


Abstract
The Erdheim Chester disease is a rare form of non Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Its rarity and its unspecific clinical presentation, make that its diagnosis is often delayed.
We report the case of a 50 years old female who has an Erdheim Chester disease, revealed by a central diabetes insipidus with thickening of the pituitary stalk, with associated gonadotropin deficiency.
The Erdheim Chester disease was suspected because of the association with other evocative systemic lesions: eyelid xanthelasmas and bone lesions in metaphyseal-diaphyseal region of the upper and lower ends of both femurs and tibias on bone scan.
Confirmation of the diagnosis was initially difficult and delayed, with initially inconclusive cutaneous and bone biopsies.
It is the histological re-reading with immunohistochemical study of the bone biopsies which allowed the diagnosis by showing histiocytes positive for the CD68 and negative for the CD1a and the protein S100.
The diagnosis was made with a delay of 3 years.
In conclusion, although rare, Erdheim Chester disease should be suspected in front of a set of clinical and radiological arguments.
Diagnostic confirmation is based on histological and especially immunohistochemical studies.


Abstract
Pain is one of the most common reasons for consultation in the ER.
Those included in the study were given 1 g of paracetamol and a weight-ajusted dose of either tramadol or oxycodone.
Every 30 minutes, a simple numerical scale (NS) was established and the clinical parameters were checked.
There is an average difference of -1.47 between the average ?
NS of the oxycodone group and the average ?
NS of the tramadol group, with a confidence interval of 95 % (-9.42 - 6.48).
The confidence interval does not cross the -10 line considered as the acceptable loss of efficiency, which allows us to conclude that oxycodone is not inferior to tramadol.
As far as the adverse effects studied are concerned, there is no significant link between the treatment and the appearance of any side effect.

Invented practically for dentistry, in particular in implantology, the CBCT found major indications in paranasal sinus imaging, in maxillofacial and oral surgery, in periodontology, endodontics and orthodontics.


Abstract
Surprisingly, this situation is often under-recognized or even neglected in clinical practice.
Yet, most oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents have limitations in case of renal impairment, either because they require a dose reduction, or are contra-indicated mainly for safety reasons.


Abstract
Paracentesis is a frequent procedure, especially in patients with cirrhosis.
In these patients, given the fears of severe bleeding associated with coagulation disorders as well as thrombocytopenia, we were interested to review the literature on this subject.
Few studies are available and, for the moment, recommendations are of a low level of evidence.
Renal insufficiency, Child-Pugh C cirrhosis, thrombocytes < 50 G/L and cirrhosis of alcoholic origin may however increase the risk of bleeding.
Caution should be observed in these patients.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequent, progressive and lethal disease.


Abstract
The reactive hemophagocytic syndrome comes from an overstimulation of the immune system which causes a cytokine storm.
This syndrome should be supported in conjunction with the hematologist, and initiation of a treatment is a medical emergency.


Abstract
Venous thromboembolism is frequently associated with hormonal factors in women.
In contrary to progestin-only-pills, estroprogestative contraceptives increase 3-6 times the risk of venous thrombosis.
In assisted reproductive techniques, venous thrombosis is frequently associated with the occurrence of a severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.
Antagonist ovarian stimulation protocols lower the risk of hyperstimulation and should therefore be preferred.
Finally, at menopause, hormonal treatments combining transdermal estradiol and micronized progesterone do not seem to increment the risk of thrombosis.

Abstract
Muscle loss associated with disease (cachexia) or with aging (sarcopenia) is common in dogs, but clinically relevant methods for quantifying muscle loss are needed.
We previously validated an ultrasound method of quantifying muscle size in dogs in a single breed.
The goal of this study was to assess the variability and reproducibility of the Vertebral Epaxial Muscle Score (VEMS) in other dog breeds.
Static ultrasound images were obtained from 38 healthy, neutered dogs of 5 different breeds between 1- and 5-years-old.


Abstract
The objectives of the present study were to determine if diagnosis and treatment of equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) vary by geographic region and to report the prevalence of PPID in horses as observed by veterinarians across locations.
An online questionnaire was developed for veterinarians who treat horses.
Veterinary associations, especially equine specialty subgroups, were contacted and a survey link was sent to members of each organization.
Generalized linear models were used to examine whether the method of diagnosis and treatment of this condition, as well as its reported prevalence, differed by geographic region.
Veterinarians from 426 separate clinics in 20 countries returned surveys.
Diagnosis of PPID varied by region, but was usually based on clinical signs and an adjunct endocrine test.
Horses with PPID were treated medically by 63% of veterinarians and 75% of these used pergolide mesylate as treatment.
The median prevalence estimated was 1% and this did not differ by geographic location.
Half the veterinarians were caring for 5 or more animals with PPID.
Overall, diagnostic approach differed in geographic regions.
In general, European veterinarians were more likely than those in North America to diagnose PPID based on clinical signs alone, without using an adjunct laboratory test.
Veterinarians reported that cost and management responsibilities were their clients' primary concerns associated with the long-term treatment of this disease, which indicates a need for additional treatment options for PPID.

Abstract
The digital cushion (DC) plays a role in absorbing and dampening forces applied to the foot and therefore supports internal structures such as navicular bone; yet, its architecture is not well-known.
The goal of this study was to characterize the microanatomical structure of the DC in horses with clinically sound hooves.
The samples were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, and Weigert's elastic stains.
On each slide, 2 central 3- × 3-mm areas were microscopically assessed and all measurements were done within the 9-mm2 area.


Abstract
Ultrasonography is not often used in feline dermatology.
The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness and applicability of ultrasonography for skin evaluation in 21 clinically healthy cats.
Ultrasonographic examination was conducted in 4 cutaneous regions (frontal, dorsal neck, sacral, and abdominal) using an 18-MHz linear-sequential-array transducer.
Findings were assessed using histomorphometric analysis of skin samples set as reference standards.
Morphologic evaluation, thickness measurements, measurement variability, and comparison between regions and genders were carried out.
The ultrasonographic pattern of feline skin was characterized by 3 distinct layers of different echogenicity and echostructure.
Skin was thickest at the dorsal neck region and thinnest at the abdominal region.
Skin at the frontal region and dorsal neck region was thicker in males.
Variability was < 10% in all regions.
No apparent correspondence was found between ultrasonographic and histometric measurements of skin thickness.
Collectively, these findings suggest that ultrasonography is a simple, noninvasive, and reproducible technique that allows cutaneous layers to be identified and accurately measures skin thickness in cats.

Abstract
The aim of this study was to assess whether MK-467 could be a substrate of an active efflux transport mechanism.
MK-467 was studied at 2 concentrations: 200 and 1000 ng/mL.
Samples for analysis were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min after drug application.
Drug concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.
MK-467 showed no apparent permeability in the apical-basolateral direction, transport in the basolateral-apical direction occurred in both cell lines.
Efflux ratios were not calculated.
However, MK-467 appeared to undergo active cellular transport.

Abstract
Quality of life among postmenopausal women in rural Minia, Egypt.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of menopausal symptoms and their effect on the quality of life of postmenopausal women in rural Minia.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1 100 postmenopausal women aged 45-60 years selected by multistage random sampling.
The menopause rating scale (MRS) was used to assess the menopausal symptoms.
The mean age at menopause was 48.9 (SD 4) years.
The most frequent symptoms were joint and muscle pain (82.1%), physical and mental exhaustion (69.6%) and hot flushes and sweating (49.2%).
The mean MRS somatic score was 4.12 (SD 2.22), the psychological score was 2.86 (SD 2.50) and urogenital score was 2.13 (SD 1.04).
The total MRS score indicated that the symptoms were of moderate severity [9.11 (SD 5.76)].
Education, marital status, occupation, parity and postmenopausal duration were significantly associated with MRS score.
Rural primary health care workers should be aware of this critical stage of life in women to help women deal with symptoms that may affect their quality of life.


Abstract
Raising awareness of health care providers about MERSCoV infection in public hospitals in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
It is important that health care workers have good knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards MERS-CoV, especially in Mecca because of the MERS-CoV threat during hajj and umrah.
This study aimed to assess KAP of health care providers in public hospitals in Mecca about MERS-CoV infection and evaluate the effectiveness of a health education intervention to improve KAP.
After 3 months, 188 participants responded to the post-intervention evaluation.
Significant post-intervention improvement was found in the median scores for knowledge (P < 0.001), attitude (P = 0.022) and cumulative KAP (P < 0.001); scores improved irrespective of age group and gender.
Practice scores did not improve significantly, although reported practices were good before the intervention.
The positive effects of the intervention support efforts to continuously implement health education interventions for health care providers in Mecca.


Abstract
Modifying attitude and intention toward regular physical activity using protection motivation theory: a randomized controlled trial.
In a randomized controlled trial, we selected using convenience sampling 60 overweight and obese women attending health centres.
The women were allocated to 2 groups of 30 receiving a standard weight-control programme or motivational interviewing.
All constructs of the theory (perceived susceptibility, severity, self-efficacy and response efficacy) and all anthropometric characteristics (except body mass index) were significantly different between the groups at 3 study times.
The strongest predictors of intention to do regular physical exercise were perceived response efficacy and attitude at 2- and 6-months follow-up.

Abstract
Hepatitis E virus seroprevalence in pregnant women in Pakistan: maternal and fetal outcomes.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is endemic in Pakistan.
We conducted a descriptive study from April to October 2015 in 10 tertiary care hospitals throughout Pakistan to determine maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in HEV-positive pregnant women with acute jaundice or raised liver function tests.
Twenty-one of 135 women were HEV positive and in 3rd trimester except for 1 in 1st trimester.
Overall prevalence of HEV in pregnancy was 0.19%.
Ten women were artificially induced, 3 had premature labour, 4 delivered spontaneously (full term), 3 died and there was 1 intrauterine death.
One woman had a home abortion before coming to hospital.
There were 7 perinatal infant deaths: 4 intrauterine, 3 stillbirths and 1 abortion.
Case fatality rate of HEV infection in pregnancy was 14.2%.


Abstract
Long-term care hospitals in Turkey: a review.
A long-term care hospital (LTCH) is a specialized facility for patients with serious health problems who require continuous and intensive care but not comprehensive diagnostic methods.
LTCHs provide prolonged complex care and wound care in the period following the acute stage of disease.
When intensive care unit (ICU) stay is prolonged in the United States of America, the patients may be transferred to an LTCH.
Medicare suggests hospitalization > 25 days in LTCHs.
In practice, patients who need LTC in Turkey are hospitalized in ICUs.
A significant proportion of intensive care beds in Turkey are used for long-term hospitalized patients with complex problems.
This is a clear waste of resources.
The establishment of LTCHs in Turkey would prevent from this waste and provide the opportunity to increase experience of complex treatments.


Abstract
Perceptions of use of a case-based, integrated national electronic public health surveillance system in Jordan.
Collection of real-time, standardized data remains a challenge for public health surveillance systems.
The use of mobile information technology may facilitate this.
A national case-based public health surveillance system was introduced in Jordan in 2015 using mobile tablets and an online framework.
After training on the system, users were surveyed about their perceptions of it.
Of 596 participants attending the training, 580 (97.3%) completed the survey.
The majority of users were nurses (58.5%).
In all areas, over 80% of participants thought the system would help their work and would save time in identifying notifiable diseases and reporting this information centrally.
Further work is encouraged to evaluate the system and consider the application of cloud-based models in other settings.


Abstract
Radio technologists with education level higher than bachelor degree and < 5 years' work experience showed a significantly higher level of knowledge.
The most radiosensitive organs were correctly identified as the lungs and stomach by 6.9% and 4.9%, respectively, and 2.5% correctly identified the gonads as the next most radiosensitive organ.
There was a serious deficit in knowledge and awareness of radiation hazards among Palestinian radio technologists, which may expose patients to unnecessary doses of ionizing radiation.
This indicates the need for mandatory training and education about radiation protection in all Palestinian healthcare institutions.


Abstract
Frontotemporal dementia is a health issue that encompasses different specialties.
This type of dementia is underdiagnosed and usually confused initially with psychiatric pathologies.
Its clinical aspect as well as its evolution is a challenge for the physician on a daily basis due to the heterogeneity of the various forms.
The diagnosis is usually uncertain and the current treatment can only treat the symptoms.
The care of the patient and his entourage must be done in a multidisciplinary way.
The advancement of research in its later years has brought to light genetic mutations that have led to a better understanding of pathology and pathophysiology.
In the near future, these discoveries could lead to new targeted therapies.


Abstract
Will my patient actually benefit from the medication that I've prescribed?
Faced with an elderly, frail patient, the family doctor is often confronted by this dilemma.


Abstract
Limitation of inappropriate prescribing must be a medical concern in daily practice especially in older patients.
Their prescription is however associated with a reduced quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality.
Tools detecting inappropriate prescriptions and clinical scales that quantify the anti-ACh burden contribute, despite some limitations, to secure and optimize these drugs' prescription in this vulnerable population.

Abstract
In older persons, this urinary functional disorder is most often of multifactorial origin and/or the symptom (sometimes the unique one) of a chronic disease.
Nocturia is very annoying and its impact on health and quality of life is related to the disturbance of sleep cycles.
The impact on informal caregiver's health and the decision for institutional admission are also to be considered.
An adapted management of nocturia improves quality of life and reduces morbidity in aged patients.

We attempt to identify the strengths of current research as well as the trends that emerge from an abundant literature of a rather heterogeneous quality.


Abstract
When a combination failed to meet those criteria in 2 piglets, the next dosage of the DRT was tested.
In G3-4 four combinations were tested in 14 piglets with dose rates of 10-20 mg/kg ketamine, 3 mg/kg azaperone and 0.15-0.20 mg/kg romifidine IM.
Induction was smooth in all piglets, but depth of anaesthesia or recovery (11 and 6 piglets) were insufficient.
In G5-6 five combinations were tested in 37 piglets with dose rates of 10-20 mg/kg ketamine, 3-4 mg/kg azaperone and 0.15-0.20 mg/kg romifidine IM.
Depth of anaesthesia or recovery (17 and 7 piglets, respectively) were insufficient.
In the present study with 3-4 and 5-6 weeks old piglets, acceptable quality of anaesthesia could not be achieved despite using high drug dose rates.

Abstract
Pregnancy in the context of pulmonary hypertension is characterised by high mortality for the mother and the foetus and is therefore strongly discouraged ; contraception has to be prescribed to patients in reproductive age.
Women who decide to continue their pregnancy should be followed by multidisciplinary teams in specialised centres.
A specific treatment should be defined with no delay.
In case of clinical deterioration, the early, intravenous administration of prostacyclin should be considered.
The ideal time and method of delivery are still disputed.

Abstract
Bronchiectasis is irreversible bronchial dilatation associated with chronic respiratory symptoms.
Management is aimed at reducing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease by interrupting the vicious circle: bronchial infection, inflammation, altered mucociliary clearance, lung destruction.
Unlike the literature on inhaled antibiotics in cystic fibrosis, literature data are limited and of low quality for bronchiectasis of other causes.


Abstract
Dementia care of good quality is particularly important given the projected increase in the number of people living with the condition.
A range of assistive technologies have been proposed to support dementia care.
However, the World Health Organization estimated in 2017 that only one in 10 of the 1 billion or more people globally who could benefit from these technologies in some way actually has access to them.
The aim of this paper is to examine the relevant provisions of the convention and consider their implications for the use of assistive technologies in dementia care.
Assistive technologies can clearly play an important role in supporting social engagement, decision-making and advance planning by people living with dementia.
However, concerns exist that some of these technologies also have the potential to restrict freedom of movement and intrude into privacy.
In conclusion, an analysis of the implications of assistive technologies for human rights laws is needed to ensure that technologies are used in ways that support human rights and help meet the health-related SDG 3.


Abstract
In most countries, a fundamental shift in the focus of clinical care for older people is needed.
This, in turn, requires a change in the way services are organized: there should be more integration within the health system and between health and social services.
Existing organizational structures do not have to merge; rather, a wide array of service providers must work together in a more coordinated fashion.
Moreover, older people can participate in, and contribute to, society for longer.
Integration at the level of clinical care is especially important: older people should undergo comprehensive assessments with the goal of optimizing functional ability and care plans should be shared among all providers.
At the health system level, integrated care requires: (i) supportive policy, plans and regulatory frameworks; (ii) workforce development; (iii) investment in information and communication technologies; and (iv) the use of pooled budgets, bundled payments and contractual incentives.
However, action can be taken at all levels of health care from front-line providers through to senior leaders - everyone has a role to play.


Abstract
Increasing use of antibiotics and rising levels of bacterial resistance to antibiotics are a challenge to global health and development.
In Sweden, a rapid spread of resistant pneumococci in the southern part of the country triggered the formation of the Swedish strategic programme against antibiotic resistance, also known as Strama, in 1995.
The creation of the programme was an important starting point for long-term coordinated efforts to tackle antibiotic resistance in the country.
A key element for achieving long-term changes has been the bottom-up approach, including working closely with prescribers at the local level.
The work described here and the lessons learnt could inform countries implementing their own national action plans against antibiotic resistance.

Abstract
Clinicians are confronted to an abundance of clinical practice guidelines (CPG).
It has been proven for several pathologies that the use of guidelines improves quality of care by reducing mortality, the number of hospitalisations and the length of stay.
Since adherence to CPGs are influenced by their accessibility and format, informatics will certainly play an important role in the development and implementation of CPGs in the future.
An online platform listing swiss CPGs is now available.


Abstract
We quantified the daily tasks of our internal medicine residents.
They didnot manage to fulfill their duties in the scheduled time and had to stay after hours ; further, activities indirectly related to patients predominated.
Residents spent a daily average of 1.7 hours with patients, 5.2 hours with the computer, and 13 minutes with both.
Computer use predominated before 8 am or after 6 pm, while time dedicated to the patient was concentrated in morning during the medical round.
Improvements are needed to increase residents' efficiency, and to make them focus on high medical value activities.

Abstract
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in western countries.
Despite advances in acute management of patients, secondary prevention remains essential and should include cardiac rehabilitation.
However, the different rehabilitation programs proposed are still too uneven in content and duration and the number of patients participating in these programs remains low.
Home based cardiac rehabilitation technologies have already shown some effectiveness and could improve some of the weaknesses of rehabilitation programs.
Again protocols and tools need to be improved and standardized.
The budgetary impact will also have to be studied further.


Abstract
The aim of the study was to assess the degree of similarity between the distress expressed by parents of a child cancer survivor and the distress perceived by the oncologist.
Overall, 61 parents of a child cancer survivor (between 4 and 6 years of cancer remission) were recruited in Belgian hospitals (Province of Liège).
Parents filled out questionnaires about the intolerance of uncertainty (IUS), positive beliefs about worry (WW-II), parental worries about the evolution of their child's health (QIPS-R15), problem orientation (NPOQ), cognitive avoidance (CAQ), ruminations (Mini-CERTS), and anxiety/depression (HADS).
Eight oncologists who having taken care of the child filled out the «OncoMed» questionnaire that examines their perception of the parental distress (e.g. anxiety, worries).
Parents suffered from anxiety,worries about their child's health and showed a low level of tolerance of uncertainty.
The study highlights the need to detect early parents who are intolerant of uncertainty in order to offer them an efficient psychological follow-up.
This study underlines finally the necessity to develop medical perception tools about the distress in order to strengthen the medical communication and the follow-up of these families.

This diagnosis was suitable with the patient's syndrome and was eligible for percutaneous closure procedure allowing immediate resolution of symptoms and confirming the diagnosis.


Abstract
Multidisciplinary work is gaining importance with the ageing of the population, an increase in the number of chronically ill patients, and patients' preference for homebased healthcare.
Multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) were designed to foster dialogue between care providers of patients with decreasing autonomy.
Despite being financed by the Health Insurance, few professionals use it.
This study aimed at an exploration of the professionals' reasons for this lack of MDTM.
MDTMs place the patient at the forefront, and allow professionals to meet and agree on a treatment plan.
A range of different working practices and cultures challenges the method.


Abstract
Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting ProProtein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9).
PCSK9 is a circulating enzyme secreted by the liver and plays a key role in the LDL-Receptors (LDL-R) turnover.
Inhibiting PCSK9 is a new way to markedly reduce LDL-C.
The clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab have been studied in a number of controlled trials versus placebo or versus active comparator (ézétimibe) during 12 to 76 weeks.
Evolocumab also reduced LCL-C in monotherapy in statin-intolerant patients.
Evolocumab also significally reduced total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, apoprotein B and lipoprotein(a).
Safety and tolerance were good.
Evolocumab is commercialized under the trade name Repatha® and administrated subcutaneously at the dose of 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg once per month.
Repatha® is approved in Belgium, with conditions, for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with heterozygous (HFe) and homozygous (HFo) familial hypercholesterolemia.


Abstract
of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: global functioning and symptoms persistence.
Many adolescents with ADHD show antisocial behaviour and low educational achievement.
These issues have not been validated in the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region.
The objective of this study was to assess the global functioning and behaviour of children with ADHD growing into adolescence 10 years after initial diagnosis.
Parents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire, Conner's Short Version Test and the Children's Global Assessment Scale.
Nearly half of our sample had low academic achievement and 36% had no friends.
A quarter of the cases were smokers, one admitted abusing drugs and one had attempted suicide.
One third of the sample continued to have ADHD symptoms.
A follow-up study into adult life using a control group is recommended.


Abstract
Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based serotype analysis of dengue virus during 2015 dengue outbreak in Pakistan.
Dengue is one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases.
It is endemic in > 125 countries including Pakistan, with a global incidence of 50-200 million.
We determined the frequency of different serotypes of dengue virus to highlight its hyperendemicity in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
Between May and October 2015 we analysed the serum samples of 140 patients with a suspicion of dengue, using ELISA and multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
One hundred and eight were infected with serotype 2, 16 with serotype 3, 7 with serotype 4 and 3 with serotype 1.
Three patients were infected with serotypes 1 and 2, and 1 each with serotypes 1 and 4 and serotypes 2 and 3.
Incidence of dengue has increased many fold in the past 50 years and has expanded to areas that were previously free from the disease.
Serotype 2 was predominant in our population followed by serotype 3.


Abstract
Third study on WHO MPOWER Tobacco Control Scores in Eastern Mediterranean countries 2011-2015.
This study was conducted to quantify the implementation of the MPOWER policies and to assess any possible changes across Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries.
In this comparative cross-sectional study based on 10 categories mentioned in MPOWER report 2015 a checklist was designed.
Seven questions were scored from 0-4 and three from 0-3.
The 22 EMR countries were ranked and compared by their total score on a scale of 0-37.
The highest scores were achieved by Egypt and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Pakistan, Sudan and Yemen showed progress, while Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, and the Syrian Arab Republic had decreased scores.
The total score of the EMR countries had decreased compared to 2013.
Thus, there remains a need for greater focus on tobacco taxation and smoke-free policies to address this retrograde step.


Abstract
Mood and anxiety disorders among adolescent students in Jordan.
Mental disorders in adolescents have negative impacts on aspects of health and life that can be reduced by early detection and referral.
This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders and to investigate their association with gender and other socio-demographic factors among adolescent students.
A descriptive cross-sectional design was used in this study.
A sample of 1103 adolescent students was recruited from schools who completed the first two sections of Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A).
The prevalence of any mental disorders was 28.6%.
The prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders was 22.4% and 16.3%, respectively.
Significant associations were found between mental disorders and gender, age, living status with parents, or mental health status of parents.
Further studies are needed to be conducted in Jordan in order to understand the nature and risk factors of mental disorders among adolescents.
School and community-based mental health screening, promotion and prevention programmes are recommended to prevent and reduce the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents.


Abstract
Midwives' educational needs and knowledge about sexually transmittable infections in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study aimed to evaluate the educational needs and knowledge about sexually transmittable infections (STIs) demonstrated by midwives.
In a cross-sectional study in 2014, 144 midwives in Rasht, Islamic Republic of Iran, were surveyed.
The Persian version of the Sexually Transmitted Disease Knowledge Questionnaire (STD-KQ) and a researcher-made questionnaire to evaluate educational needs and profile were used.
The participants obtained 74% of the total score of STD-KQ.
However, only 6.3% of midwives were aware of existing STIs guidelines.
Participants reported that in the last two years they were only educated about HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B at their workplace.
Thus, a comprehensive educational programme to empower midwives for complete STIs control is recommended.


Abstract
Development of an Eastern Mediterranean Region search strategy for biomedical citations indexed in PubMed.
PubMed, a 'barrier-free' bibliographic database covering biomedical and health disciplines, has been successfully used to identify a multitude of indicators that assist in analyzing global trends for biomedical research productivity.
The current study represents an original attempt to develop and optimize an Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) search strategy in PubMed to pave the way for subsequent descriptive analyses.
The refined EMR search strategy contains elaborate syntaxes which facilitate controlling the search process and maintaining a proper balance between sensitivity and precision of the obtained results.
Country-specific citation data were manually scanned for false positive publications.
Our results indicate that publication productivity increased nearly five-fold in the EMR from 2004 to 2013.
Five countries (Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Pakistan; in order of total publications) contributed to 80% of all EMR publications during this period.
Each of the remaining 17 EMR countries contributed less than 4%.
We believe that the methodology presented in this study can be used in conjunction with other metrics to extract invaluable indicators to describe EMR health research systems.


Abstract
Awareness, attitudes and knowledge about evidencebased medicine among doctors in Gaza: a crosssectional survey.
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has emerged as a strategy to integrate research evidence within clinical decision-making.
We have explored awareness, knowledge and attitudes about EBM among doctors in the Gaza Strip.
In 2014, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among doctors working in health centres in Gaza, using a 20 item, web-based self-administered questionnaire.
Approximately two thirds of the respondents welcomed EBM in principle, and believed that it could improve patient care.
However, they had a relatively low level of knowledge about EBM.
The main barriers to EBM mentioned by respondents were lack of knowledge needed to practise EBM [n = 47 (35%)]; negative attitude among senior colleagues [n = 34 (25%)]; lack of relevant resources [n = 31 (23%)]; work overload [n = 27 (20%)]; and lack of institutional support [n = 248 (18%)].
Thus, there are personal and organisational barriers to its practice that need to be addressed.


Abstract
Study of congenital heart diseases in patients with Down syndrome in Algeria.
This study aimed to describe and evaluate the type, frequency and patterns of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) in patients with Down Syndrome (DS) in Sétif, Algeria.
Down Syndrome, or trisomy 21, is the most common genetic disorder in the world.
Data were collected and followed from January 2009 to December 2013.
Parental consanguinity documenting pedigree analyzing, chromosome analysis and clinical examination were carried out for all cases.
Among the 110 cases, 75 (68%) have single cardiac abnormalities and 35 (32%) have multiple cardiac abnormalities.
The most frequent CHDs were Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD).
In conclusion, our study will be helpful to demonstrate the current status of DS and to identify the distribution of CHD in patients with DS in Sétif, Algeria, for further study.

Evaluation of biomedical waste management in primary health care centres in Saudi Arabia: a knowledge, attitudes and practices study.
Awareness and knowledge of biomedical waste practices is very important for any health care setting.
This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) about biomedical waste among health professionals in primary health care centres in Hail City, Saudi Arabia.
The study included 135 of 155 professionals who dealt with biomedical waste from 16 out of 26 primary health care centres.
Data were collected using a structured questionnaire.
Overall 54.8%, 48.9% and 49.6% of the participants had good knowledge, attitudes and practices scores respectively.
Profession, education and age were significantly associated with KAP level (P < 0.01): doctors, those with a degree and older respondents had better KAP scores.
There was a strong correlation between knowledge and attitudes, knowledge and practices, and attitudes and practices (P ˂ 0.05).
Training is recommended to enhance the knowledge of the professionals dealing with biomedical waste in the primary health care centres.


Abstract
However, infectious diseases remain one of the most serious complication in this population, hence associated with a high morbidity and mortality.
Several famous societies edited guidelines, but those differ from each other and cannot be transposed from a country to another without considering their local epidemiology and implemented vaccination schedule.
Moreover, development and availability of new vaccines render recommendations constantly susceptible to adaptations.
After exhaustive literature review, this article aims to offer pragmatic answers to the main questions raised by healthcare workers when vaccinating children after a bone marrow transplant.


Abstract
Diagnosis is clinical.
Skin biopsy is not essential except in doubtful cases (eg bullous drug eruption can simulate Lyell Syndrome or mucosal reminiscent of erythema multiforme).
The etiology is almost always drug-induced; rare cases of toxic or food issue were reported.
Histopathology is immuno-allergic; recurrences correspond to re-exposure to allergen.
There is no specific treatment except stopping the causing drug.


Abstract
Why the name "Erasmus" for an hospital ?
Apart for local circumstances, there are far more obvious reasons for this choice.
Erasmus was in close contact with the medical world.
For these various reasons giving the name « Erasmus » to the university clinics of the Free University of Brussels (ULB) was a judicious choise.

Abstract
Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios for unfavourable XDR-TB treatment outcomes.
Overall treatment success was 25%.
Mental disorders and drug/alcohol use were found in respectively 22.4% and 20.4% of patients; neither were associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes.
Future research should explore the relationship between mental health and drug/alcohol use in XDR-TB treatment outcomes.


Abstract
Bedaquiline (BDQ) has been recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) since 2013, but experience using the drug in high-burden, lower-income countries is limited and case studies are needed.
Swaziland started using BDQ under national TB programme conditions in 2015 in four pilot sites.
As of 1 December 2016, 93 patients had been initiated on BDQ, i.e., 19% of MDR-TB patients treated in the country.
Swaziland has developed a systematic and efficient model for BDQ introduction in collaboration with several partners.
This model is also being used to introduce other innovations and can serve as an example for other countries facing similar challenges.


Abstract
When the dam's serum was available detection of antibodies against B. melitensis, C. burnetii, C. abortus and Leptospira spp. was performed.
In 37 cases sufficient placental tissue was available for pathological and histopathological examination.
From the 77 cases 11 (14.3%) were positive by staining whereas real-time PCR detected C. burnetii and C. abortus in 49.3% and 32.5% of the cases.
A single abortive agent was identified in 44.2% of the cases and in 31.2% multiple possible abortifacients were present.
Our study shows that the highest clarification rate can only be achieved by a combination of methods and evidences the role that multi-infections play as cause of abortion.


Abstract
Rare Vascular Diseases (RVD) encompass different types of vessel involvement.
Some cause a dilation, others a weakening or tortuosity of the arterial wall, others an obstruction or excessive calcification of arterial walls.
Clinical pathway of patients with RVD to diagnosis is often long and complex.


Abstract
Venous malformations are slow flow dysplastic lesions, constituted by a vascular nest without arterial or capillary connections, more or less independent of the normal venous anatomy and circulation.
In certain cases a treatment is required for symptom relief or for natural complications management.
Several substances have been used with different efficacy and side effects rate.
We review the literature and present some cases.


Abstract
Characterized by an aplasia, hypoplasia or dysplasia of the lymphatic network, the primary lymphedema takes part of rare diseases.
If 10 % of cases are congenital, the majority of them are detected before 35 years, most of the time due to an intercurrent event suh as a sprain or an infection.
Although rarer, some primaries lymphedemas are family forms such the syndromes of Milroy and Meige.
The primary lymphedema can also be a part of more complex malformative diseases such as Klinefelter, Turner or Noonan syndromes.
If the lymphatic drainage associated with the elastic contention remains the basis care of lymphedema, we have to identify these patients as well as their family, sometimes requiring multidisciplinary cares.

Abstract
Oral health in Lebanon: a pilot pathfinder survey.
The study involved 320 students, of whom 158 were 12 years old and 162 were 15 years old.
The decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) scores for 12 and 15-year-olds were 5.0 and 7.7, respectively.
Ninety-two per cent (92%) of the children aged 12 years and 96% of the children aged 15 years were affected by dental caries.
The prevalence of periodontal disease among 15-year-olds was shown to be one of the highest (94.5%) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.


Abstract
Drug utilization in primary healthcare centres in the Gaza Strip.
This study was carried out to analyse drug-prescribing practices in primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in the Gaza Strip.
We retrospectively evaluated 2569 prescriptions from 22 PHCs during January-December 2014.
Systematic random sampling was applied.
Analysis followed the World Health Organization recommended core prescribing indicators.
The mean number of drugs prescribed per encounter was 2 (standard deviation 0.9); the percentage of drugs prescribed by generic name was 10.1%; and 67.5% of prescriptions contained an antibiotic followed by analgesics (39.4%).
Major omission errors were found in 89.5% of all prescriptions.
For all drugs prescribed, drug duration, strength, frequency, dose and dosage form were not mentioned in 79.3%, 65.4%, 30.6%, 23.3% and 12.5% of prescriptions, respectively.
Nonofficial abbreviations were used to write 87.4% of prescriptions.
There is a clear need to develop standards for drug prescribing, standard treatment guidelines for drug use, along with continuing medical education programmes, and the implementation of monitoring systems to ensure that they are adhered to.


Abstract
Effect of pre-pregnancy maternal body mass index on pregnancy outcomes in nulliparous women in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pre-pregnancy BMI on pregnancy outcomes.
BMI was calculated measured in 360 nulliparous women.
According to BMI, pregnant women were placed into three groups: group I (lean group BMI ≤ 19.8), group II (normal weight group BMI = 19.9-24.9), and group III (obese group BMI ≥ 25).
Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.
The mean duration of the first and the second stage of labour were significantly different between three groups (P < 0.001).
Cesarean section ratio in group I was lower than group II (OR = 0.15; P = 0.013).
Instrumental delivery in group III was more than group II (OR=4.6; P = 0.002).
Risk of nonreactive non-stress test (NST) was significantly different between groups II and III (OR = 5.7; P = 0.009).
Induction ratio in group I was lower than group II (OR=0.43; P = 0.002).
Deviation of BMI from the normal level is associated with adverse outcomes of pregnancy and delivery.


Abstract
Factors associated with folic acid knowledge and intake among pregnant women in Sudan.
Preconceptual folic acid use is known to have a protective effect against neural tube defects (NTDs).
This study assessed knowledge and determinants of awareness on folic acid use among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Sudan during 2014.
The standardized, anonymous questionnaire was used to collect data.
Almost 80% of respondents had heard of folic acid.
College-educated women (92.2%) knew more about folic acid and used it more often in the pre-conceptual period (8.3%).
Doctors were the commonest source of information on folic acid (62%).
Fewer subjects (8.9%) knew that it prevented birth defects, and 33.8% of subjects knew that green leafy vegetables are a source of folic acid.
Of all subjects, only 3.2% use it preconceptually.
Supplementation of folic acid preconceptually needs to be addressed in order to reduce the rate of NTDs found in Sudan.


Abstract
Developing a socioeconomic index for health research in Iraq.
Although socioeconomic status is one of the essential factors in much health research, it is one of the most difficult constructs to measure.
The aim of this study was to develop a relatively accurate, easy-to-calculate method to estimate socioeconomic status (SES) for health research in Iraq as well as similar profile countries in the developing world.
After reviewing various methods of calculating SES, a new method is proposed based on the 3 main variables: education, occupation and wealth/income.
Additional refinement was done based on experience and job status.
Content validity was calculated through experts' opinions and reliability through test/retest.
Based on experts' opinions, it was found that the calculated content validity ratio for the SES index was relatively high and the correlation coefficient reliability for the six variables (education, occupation, income, wealth, experience and job status) was very high.
Thus, the suggested method is reasonably valid, reliable as well as easy to calculate.


Abstract
Toxic metals in maternal blood, cord blood and meconium of newborn infants in Pakistan.
Toxic metals and deficiency/excess of trace elements can have adverse effects on health.
The aim of this study was to quantify toxic metals lead, cadmium and trace elements zinc, copper, aluminium (Al) and Iron (Fe) levels in pregnant women, cord blood and meconium of new-born infants from industrial zones of Karachi, Pakistan.
Blood samples of pregnant women (n = 416), cord blood (n = 309) and meconium (n = 309) were analyzed quantitatively for metals and trace elements.
Results indicated that mothers residing in steel towns were found to have the highest levels of lead.
Meconium contained high levels of toxic heavy metals and trace elements compared to cord blood and maternal blood.
Maternal blood toxic metals were present in high quantities.
Therefore, safety measures should be taken when industrial waste is disposed of in order to prevent population contamination.


Abstract
Pregnancy outcome variables and associated factors in different nationalities living in Kuwait.
This study aimed to investigate differences in pregnancy outcome among various nationalities residing in Kuwait.
Significant differences among various nationalities were observed in mHb, HC, CHL, PW and MH.
Kuwaiti and Indian women had lower PW and their babies had lower HC and CHL.
Prevalence of anaemia (Hb <11.0 g/dL) ranged from 7.1% (Lebanese) to 30.0% (Kuwaiti) with the overall prevalence of 19.5%.
Prevalence of low birth weight was 3.5%.
Multiple linear regression analysis revealed PW as a significant predictor of BW, CHL and HC.


Abstract
Near-miss cases admitted to a maternal intensive care unit, Alexandria, Egypt.
Survival of severe pregnancy complication is known as maternal near-miss; however, studies on maternal near-miss are few in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
To identify the predisposing factors and diagnoses of near-miss cases, patients admitted to the maternal intensive care unit of El-Shatby University Hospital in Alexandria, Egypt, were assessed.
Low maternal education and inadequate antenatal care were significantly associated with maternal mortality.
Severe pre-eclampsia and post-partum hemorrhage were the most common causes of admission (40.2% and 23.8% respectively).
Mortality index was 8.5%.
Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction were significant predictors of maternal mortality.


Abstract
First study in Qatar to reveal high Legionella counts in cooling towers.
Legionella spp. is transmitted from water to humans by aerosol-generating devices, including cooling towers (CTs).
There have not been published reports about Legionella in these systems in Qatar.
Ten CTs in Qatar University were sampled on a monthly basis.
Bacteria were recovered from 90 water samples by filtration and concentration.
Legionella DNA copy number (CN) was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR.
Legionella DNA was detected in 100% of the samples.
The bacterial counts ranged from 0.006 to 199.56 CFU/mL, and critical counts were found in 51 (56.7 %) samples.
Moreover, 7 (7.8%) samples showed a count of more than 100 CFU/mL.
The highest counts were found in the months of May and June.
These results suggest that this organism is found in high number in tested CTs, presenting a potential health risk to the local population.


Abstract
Sodium chloride composition of commercial white bread in Morocco.
This study aimed to evaluate the amount of salt provided by the consumption of bread in daily food intake and compare it to recommended salt intake.
The high salt content of white bread might be a contributing factor to the high sodium intake in Morocco, especially considering that bread is a staple food in the country.
Any policies or initiatives to reduce sodium consumption should target bread as a strategic vehicle to reduce salt intake.


Abstract
Assessment of World Health Organization Collaborating Centres in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Following in-house training, there was a need for assessing perceived performance of World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating centres in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, with special relevance to WHO's programme of work.
Thus, a questionnaire was shared with responsible officers covering: selection process, frequency of communication, monitoring mechanisms, key delivered activities, and identified gaps during implementation.
These included: tendency to implement regular activities, weak technical capacity and communication, and discrepancies between planned activities and actual implementation.
Recommendations for centres included: establishing communication plan/modalities, selecting activities of global/regional nature, and mobilizing resources for work plan implementation.


Abstract
Superficial digestive tumours resection by endoscopic mucosal resection and sub-mucosal dissection causes very few complications according to the results obtained in expert centers.
This work reports the rate of complications observed in a regional hospital, also comparing the results of their therapeutic management.
The first 100 patients treated by endoscopic mucosal resection and sub-mucosal dissection, conducted by conventional techniques, were studied.
The overall complication rate was 16 %.
Symptomatic stenoses are observed in 4 % of patients.
Secondary bleeding occurs in 5 % of cases.
Endoscopic management of these complications is effective in all cases, when it is attempted.
Perforations complicate 7 % of the procedures.
Two patients were assigned to surgery, successfully, the other 5 patients were treated by endoscopic sutures without damage.
The complication rates observed in our department are comparable with results reported by the reference western centers.
Their endoscopic management is usually successful and rescue surgery is unfrequent.

Abstract
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is mainly supported by the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
If the latter offer guarantees of reliability, especially by minimizing the influence of confounding factors and potential biases, they also have limitations.
This article compares the advantages and disadvantages of the two sources of information, which ideally should be complementary.


Abstract
Drug addiction or substance-use disorder is a chronically relapsing disorder that progresses through binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect and preoccupation/anticipation stages.
These stages represent diverse neurobiological mechanisms that are differentially involved in the transition from recreational to compulsive drug use and from positive to negative reinforcement.
The progression from recreational to compulsive substance use is associated with downregulation of the brain reward systems and upregulation of the brain stress systems.
Characterization of the neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie individual differences in addiction-like behaviors is the key to understanding the mechanisms of addiction and development of personalized pharmacotherapy.


Abstract
Increased physician prescribing of opioids to treat chronic nonprogressive pain has been accompanied by an increase in opioid addiction.
Twin studies of opioid addiction are consistent with an inherited component of risk, approximately 50%.
Several genome-wide association study (GWAS) reports indicate that genetic risk for opioid addiction is conveyed by many alleles of small effect (odds ratios <1.5).
These reports have detected alleles in potassium-ion-channel genes (KCNC1 and KCNG2) and in a glutamate receptor auxiliary protein (CNIH3).
Additionally, a variant at the µ-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1), which regulates OPRM1 expression appears promising.
In pharmacogenetics of opioid addictions, methadone dose may be regulated by variants in cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), a methadone-metabolizing enzyme, and by a locus 300 kb 5' to OPRM1.
A δ-opioid-receptor gene single-nucleotide polymorphism may predict treatment response to methadone versus buprenorphine.
Large clinical trials comparing effective pharmacotherapies for opioid addiction (naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine) are needed for pharmacogenetic progress.


Abstract
The majority of addictive disorders have a significant heritability-roughly around 50%.
Surprisingly, the most convincing association (a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor CHRNA5-A3-B4 gene cluster in nicotine dependence), with a unique attributable risk of 14%, was detected through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on lung cancer, although lung cancer has a low heritability.
We propose some explanations of this finding, potentially helping to understand how a GWAS strategy can be successful.
Many endophenotypes were also assessed as potentially modulating the effect of nicotine, indirectly facilitating the development of nicotine dependence.


Abstract
In recent years, animal models in psychiatric research have been criticized for their limited translational value to the clinical situation.
Failures in clinical trials have thus often been attributed to the lack of predictive power of preclinical animal models.
These models provide excellent face validity, and it is assumed that the neurochemical and neuroanatomical substrates involved in drug-intake behavior are similar in laboratory rodents and humans.
Consequently, animal models of drug consumption and addiction provide predictive validity.


Abstract
Most research designed to answer the "why" of the prescription opioid epidemic has relied on structured interviews, which rigidly attempt to capture the complex reasons people use opioids.
In contrast this systematic literature review focuses on peer-reviewed studies that have used a qualitative approach to examine the development of an opioid-use disorder from the point of initial exposure.
Rather than simply providing a "high," opioids reportedly relieve psychological/emotional problems or provide an escape from life stressors.
As use continues, avoidance of withdrawal sickness becomes an overriding concern, with all other benefits playing minor roles in persistent use.
These studies indicate that terms used in structured interviews, such as "nontherapeutic use" or variations thereof, poorly capture the complex range of needs opioids satisfy.
Both quantitative/structured studies and more qualitative ones, as well as more focused studies, have an important role in better informing prevention and treatment efforts.


Abstract
Tobacco use remains a global problem, and options for consumers have increased with the development and marketing of e-cigarettes and other new nicotine and tobacco products, such as "heat-not-burn" tobacco and dissolvable tobacco.
The increased access to these new products is juxtaposed with expanding public health and clinical intervention options, including mobile technologies and social media.
Best outcomes occur when medications are integrated with behavioral therapies and community-based interventions.
Addressing tobacco in mental health settings requires training and technical assistance to remove old cultural barriers that restricted interventions.
Future innovations are likely to be related to pharmacogenomics and new technologies that are human-, home-, and community-facing.


Abstract
Here, we summarize current thinking regarding pharmacotherapy for substance-use disorders, grouping medications by the type of vulnerability they propose to address and providing insight into their neurobiological mechanisms.
We also examine the limitations of the brain-based disease model in addiction treatment, especially as these shortcomings pertain to the place of pharmacotherapy in recovery.


Abstract
Opioid maintenance treatment is the first-line approach in opioid dependence.
Both the full opioid agonist methadone (MET) and the partial agonist buprenorphine (BUP) are licensed for the treatment of opioid dependence.
For example, the risk of respiratory depression is lower than with MET.


Abstract
Cannabis (also known as marijuana) is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance in the world.
Though it was long considered to be a "soft" drug, studies have proven the harmful psychiatric and addictive effects associated with its use.
However, their composition and pharmacological properties make them dangerous substances.
Cannabis does have therapeutic properties for certain indications.
These therapeutic applications pertain only to certain cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives.
The objective of this article is to summarize current developments concerning cannabis and the spread of SCs.
Future studies must further explore the benefit-risk profile of medical cannabis use.


Abstract
Ballistic trauma is not the prerogative of battlefields and currently extends to civil environments.
Any surgeon or emergency room can be faced with such trauma whose management requires an understanding of wound ballistics.
The aim of this retrospective is reviewing the management of ballistic trauma within the C.H.U. Saint-Pierre hospital over a period of ten years.
Data recorded included demographics data, lesions, clinical parameters, imaging, treatment and outcome.
It appears that the wounds of the members have a low mortality rate but a significant rate of complications.
Patients should be managed according to the ATLS protocol and according hemodynamic stability and location of the injury, benefit from imaging.
Unstable patients will be operated in emergency, stable patients will be treated according to the extent of damage and the type of fracture either conservatively or by external fixator and intramedullary centromedullary.
Debridement and antibiotics are recommended as a nerve exploration if there is a peripheral paralysis.
The management of trauma in our sample appear not optimal in light of the literature especially in terms of setting the vascular point of debridement, antibiotic and nerve repair resulting in significant consequences.
Two management protocols according to patients' hemodynamic status are offered.

Among the causes of refusals of organ donation, religious reasons are often advocated.
In order to make the point, we organized a debate between representatives of secularism ( " laïcité ") and of the most represented religions in Belgium, i.e. catholic, Islamic and Judaic.


Abstract
Tamoxifen is an antagonist of the oestrogen receptor, used in the treatment of breast cancer.
VTEs increased significantly during tamoxifen therapy within 3 months of major surgery, immobilization or fracture.
Their incidence is associated with patients' risk factors, tumor and tissue induced procoagulation.
The mechanisms are still not well known.
There is a need for a better understanding in order to develope a prophylactic and therapeutic strategy.

Abstract
The systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a rare, auto-inflammatory and chronic childhood disease.
Systemic symptoms are often initially preponderant, in the absence of arthritis than can occur weeks or months later.
The typical rash is maculopapular discrete, fleeting and dew.
We present an unusual SJIA case, where the rash, like urticaria, presents itself as persistent, itchy hives.
An arthritis of the elbow appeared only one month after the onset of the disease.
This case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosis, which can only be made after the exclusion of more common (infectious) and severe (hematooncology) diseases.


Abstract
Imported malaria is a pathology mainly due to Plasmodium falciparum.
For patients with co- morbidities, such as HIV or believing themselves immune, the risk of malaria is more severe.
We present the case of a HIV patient carrier with a cerebral malaria of letal evolution despite a rapid decline in its parasitaemia using Artesunate.


Abstract
Relatively few studies have dealt with large dataset and advanced statistical methods.
Overall survival rates at 2, 3, 5 and 10 years were 0.98, 0.94, 0.87 and 0.76, respectively.
Five years survival at stages 1, 2 and 3 were 0.94, 0.92 and 0.74, respectively.
The younger patients with characteristics such as zero involved nodes, negative progesterone receptor, free skin and good prognostic level had a higher survival chance than others.
The 5-year survival probability by stage in Fars Province was nearly the same as that reported by the American Cancer Society.
The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) related to nodal status, tumour size and nuclear grade was the main indicator of breast cancer mortality.


Abstract
Validity and reliability of the Farsi version of the ECOS-16 questionnaire for females with osteoporosis.
The purpose of this study was to develop a Persian version of ECOS-16 Questionnaire and assess its reliability and validity.
Two hundred and twenty women with postmenopausal osteoporosis were included in the study.
Patients who were diagnosed as secondary osteoporosis by clinical and laboratory examinations were excluded.
For reliability, an internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient) of ECOS-16 total score was calculated.
The age of the study participants ranged from 50 to 75 years old (59.9 ± 7).
Cronbach's alpha of the Persian version of the ECOS-16 was 0.84.
Therefore, the Persian version of the ECOS-16 is a reliable and valid questionnaire to be used in the evaluation of quality of life in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.


Abstract
Medical students' knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to substance use in Lebanon: a cross-sectional survey.
The study aims were to explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of Lebanese medical students related to substance use and to determine prevalence and psychosocial predictors.
A cross-sectional survey of 231 medical students (48.6% male; 53.1% preclinical, 46.9% clinical) was conducted during June 2012-July 2013.
The questionnaire addressed knowledge and attitudes about substance use, religiosity, depression, anxiety and demographic characteristics.
The knowledge score was 52.7% (standard deviation 14.4%), and was significantly lower in 2nd year students (48.53%) than in 3rd and 4th year students (57.5% and 57.4%) (P < 0.05).
Students reported more training in drug abuse than alcohol abuse (38.2% vs. 34.4%).
One-fourth reported smoking, 57.7% using alcohol and 46.8% using drugs.
Significant predictors of lower substance use included intrinsic religiosity and interest in working in the field.
The findings reveal inadequate knowledge and considerable substance use in Lebanese medical students.
Therefore, training in substance use and counseling of students are necessary.


Abstract
Prevalence and predictors of over-the-counter medication use among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates.
The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the profile of OTC use among UAE adolescents; and (2) to determine the biological or physical, psychological or behavioural, and social predictors of OTC use among the UAE adolescent population.
Using a cross-sectional study design, data were collected on the prevalence of OTC use for a sample of 6363 adolescents.
Overall, 51% of participants in this study reported OTC use.
The most common form of OTC used was acetaminophen.
Thus, there is a need to develop public health policies and strategies that promote appropriate use of OTC in the population.

Reliable and timely health information is fundamental for health information systems (HIS) to work effectively.
This case study aims to assess Somaliland HIS in terms of its contextual situation, major weaknesses and proposes key evidence-based recommendations.
We recommend developing a national HIS strategic plan that harmonizes and directs collective efforts to become a more integrated, cost-effective and sustainable HIS.


Abstract
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) of the upper limbs are a major occupational health problem.
We report the results of a cross-sectional survey of 334 craftsmen from the governorate of Monastir in Tunisia.
The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of MSDs among these workers and determine their risk factors.
A pre-established questionnaire based on the Nordic MSD questionnaires, Karassik and the one developed by Malchaire in 2000 was used.
In the 12 months prior to the survey, the prevalence of MSDs was 92.0%.
The risk factors identified were related to individual characteristics, psychosocial factors and work organization.
Appropriate preventive measures seem necessary in this sector.


Abstract
Report on paediatric care in the Moroccan military mission in the Gaza Strip.
This report aims to describe the epidemiologic findings of the workload associated with paediatric consultation of the Moroccan Military field hospital in the Gaza Strip.
The patient Administration System and Biostatistics Activity database was reviewed and queried for all patients < 15 years of age who were consulted in the Moroccan Army hospital in the Gaza Strip between November 2012 to February 2013.
Paediatric consultations during the study period were 7420 (19.9%) out of 37 227 consultations.
The largest proportion of children were from 2 to 13 years old (3066 of 7420 children; 41.3%).
Combined, pulmonary and gastroenterology diseases were the main causes for consultations (60.4%).
Paediatric patients with threatening life injuries form part of the primary responsibility of military medical facilities during wartime.
The findings may guide future military medical care planning, particularly in war zones suffering a lack of basic infrastructure, with special a need for medical supplies and drugs.


Abstract
Recreation and sport settings (RSS) typically promote health in the form of physical activity, but the healthfulness of their food environment is often neglected.
Three key barriers were identified: 1) cultural norms associated with food in RSS and the broader environment, 2) the persisting notion of personal choice and responsibility, and 3) financial implications of healthy food provision.
These barriers challenge healthy food provision in RSS and require multi-faceted strategies to overcome social norms that undermine health behaviours.

Abstract
Fumaric acid has an important role in the citric acid cycle.
Its esters were first used by a German chemist to treat his own psoriasis, hypothesizing that the disease may be related to disturbances in this very cycle.
Meanwhile, the mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory efficacy are much better understood.

Abstract
Samples from a surrounding waterway and municipal wastewater treatment plants were also included to compare the ARG profile of urban environments and fresh water with that of feedlots.
The relative abundance of 18 resistance genes across 5 antibiotic families including sulfonamides, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and β-lactams was examined.
Sulfonamide, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam resistance genes predominated in wastewater treatment samples, while tetracycline resistance genes predominated in cattle fecal composite samples.
These results reflect the types of antibiotic that are used in cattle versus humans, but other factors such as co-selection of ARG and variation in the composition of bacterial communities associated with these samples may also play a role.


Abstract
The objectives of the study were to: i) determine baseline microvascular perfusion indices (MPI) and assess their repeatability in healthy horses under general anesthesia, and ii) compare the MPIs of 3 microvascular beds (oral mucosa, colonic serosa, and rectal mucosa).
Baseline MPI values were determined for each site, which included the total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), portion perfused vessels (PPV), and microcirculatory flow index (MFI).
Differences in MPIs between microvascular beds were not statistically significant.
Repeatability of the measurements varied for each MPI.

Abstract
The aim of this study was to determine the importance of FeLV infection in Switzerland and make a comparison with previous studies.
Young cats (=2 years) were more frequently infected than older cats, but FeLV-positive cats were up to 15 (antigen-positive) and 19 (provirus-positive) years old.
Sexually intact cats were more frequently viremic than neutered cats; purebred cats were somewhat less frequently FeLV-positive than non-purebred cats.
Of the 300 cats, only 50% were FeLV tested or vaccinated, although 90% of the cats were at risk of exposure to FeLV.
Testing and vaccination of all cats with exposure risk may help further decrease the prevalence of FeLV infection.
Moreover, characteristics of FeLV tests should be considered, such as the risk of false negative results in the early phase of infection when performing antigen testing.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lameness scoring and clinical findings.
The lameness scoring and a gait assessment took place during drying off, the first week after calving and two months after calving in 29 lame and 27 free of lameness cows.
In between the farmer scored the lamness.
Most of the lameness occurred in the hind limbs and were most frequently caused by dermatitis digitalis, Mortellaro, Limax, and Rusterholz sole ulcer.
The mean duration of lameness after treatment was 26 days (median 16 days) and was significantly longer in case of horn lesions than in skin lesions (including interdigital dermatitis).
The highest sensitivity was achieved in injuries, followed by interdigital hyperplasia.
The positive predictive values varied between 38.8% in white line lesions and 0% in Rusterholz's sole ulcer.
The negative predictive values varied between 99.1% in interdigital dermatitis and 82.3% in interdigital dermatitis.
The ROC analysis shows which lameness is more related to a certain claw disease.
The results demonstrate, that a lameness score cannot be linked to a certain claw disease.


Abstract
The lameness scoring and a gait assessment took place during drying off, in the 1st week after calving, as well as 2 months after calving.
Each lame cow was compared with a non-lame control cow from the same farm.
The milk and fertility data of the following lactation were compared with those of the previous lactation.
The mean lameness duration after treatment was 26 days (median 16 days) and was significantly longer in case of horn lesions than in skin lesions.
Lameness- free control animals were often affected by heel horn erosion and digital dermatitis.

Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social deficits and repetitive/restrictive interests.
ASD is associated with multiple comorbidities, including intellectual disability, anxiety, and epilepsy.
In this perspective, we provide an overview of the current state of ASD genetics and of how genetic research has spurred the development of in vivo and in vitro models using animals and patient cells to evaluate the impact of genetic mutations on cellular function leading to disease.
Efforts to translate these findings into successful therapies have yet to bear fruit.
We discuss how the valuable insight into the disorder provided by these new models can be used to better understand ASD and develop future clinical trials.


Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a group of neurodevelopmental conditions diagnosed solely on the basis of behavioral assessments that reveal social deficits.
Progress has been made in understanding its genetic underpinnings, but most ASD-associated genetic variants, which include copy number variants (CNVs) and mutations in ASD-risk genes, account for no more than 1 % of ASD cases.
This high level of genetic heterogeneity leads to challenges obtaining and interpreting genetic testing in clinical settings.
Most have a known genetic cause.
These ASD groups cannot be easily clinically defined because patients with a given variant have variable somatic abnormalities (dysmorphism and birth defects).
In this article, we review common diagnoses from the above categories and suggest a testing strategy for patients, guided by determining whether the individual has essential or complex ASD; patients in the latter group have multiple morphologic anomalies on physical examination.
Finally, we recommend that the syndromic versus nonsyndromic designation ultimately be replaced by classification of ASD according to its genetic etiology, which will inform about the associated spectrum and penetrance of neurobehavioral and somatic manifestations.


Abstract
Neuropsychological assessment provides a profound analysis of cognitive functioning in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Individuals on the autistic spectrum often show a high level of anxiety and are frequently affected by comorbidities that influence their quality of life.
Yet, they also have cognitive strengths that should be identified in order to develop effective support strategies.
This article presents an overview of five cognitive areas that are essential for neuropsychological evaluation (ie, intelligence, attention, executive function, social cognition, and praxis) and explores the underlying causes of behavioral problems in persons with ASD.
Furthermore, it stresses the importance of meticulous neuropsychological testing with regard to cognitive remediation, a method that can help to enhance single cognitive processes in a targeted manner.
Objective test results suggest it might be possible to promote an improved sense of coherence.
In line with the salutogenic model, this may be fundamental for human health and well-being.


Abstract
However, this inconsistency is mainly driven by the observations for male participants with ASD.

Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairment in social communication and restricted patterns of behavior.
Aripiprazole and risperidone are currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of irritability in youth with ASD.
Though not FDA-approved, methylphenidate and guanfacine are effective for the management of hyperactivity in children with ASD.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are often used in clinical practice to target anxiety and compulsions; however, there is little evidence to support its use in this population.

Abstract
A life-course approach to health encompasses strategies across individuals' lives that optimize their functional ability (taking into account the interdependence of individual, social, environmental, temporal and intergenerational factors), thereby enabling well-being and the realization of rights.
The approach is a perfect fit with efforts to achieve universal health coverage and meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
Properly applied, a life-course approach can increase the effectiveness of the former and help realize the vision of the latter, especially in ensuring health and well-being for all at all ages.
Its implementation requires a shared understanding by individuals and societies of how health is shaped by multiple factors throughout life and across generations.
Most studies have focused on noncommunicable disease and ageing populations in high-income countries and on epidemiological, theoretical and clinical issues.
The aim of this article is to show how the life-course approach to health can be extended to all age groups, health topics and countries by building on a synthesis of existing scientific evidence, experience in different countries and advances in health strategies and programmes.
A conceptual framework for the approach is presented along with implications for implementation in the areas of: (i) policy and investment; (ii) health services and systems; (iii) local, multisectoral and multistakeholder action; and (iv) measurement, monitoring and research.
The SDGs provide a unique context for applying a holistic, multisectoral approach to achieving transformative outcomes for people, prosperity and the environment.
A life-course approach can reinforce these efforts, particularly given its emphasis on rights and equity.


Abstract
With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral drugs, treatment of hepatitis C is both highly effective and tolerable.
Access to treatment for patients, however, remains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to the lack of supportive health infrastructure and the high cost of treatment.
Poorer countries are being encouraged by international bodies to organize public health responses that would facilitate the roll-out of care and treatment on a national scale.
Yet few countries have documented formal plans and policies.
Here, we outline the approach taken in Rwanda to a public health framework for hepatitis C control and care within the World Health Organization hepatitis health sector strategy.
This includes the development and implementation of policies and programmes, prevention efforts, screening capacity, treatment services and strategic information systems.
We highlight key successes by the national programme for the control and management of hepatitis C: establishment of national governance and planning; development of diagnostic capacity; approval and introduction of direct-acting antiviral treatments; training of key personnel; generation of political will and leadership; and fostering of key strategic partnerships.
Existing challenges and next steps for the programme include developing a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework and tools for monitoring of viral hepatitis.
The government needs to further decentralize care and integrate hepatitis C management into routine clinical services to provide better access to diagnosis and treatment for patients.
Introducing rapid diagnostic tests to public health-care facilities would help to increase case-finding.
Increased public and private financing is essential to support care and treatment services.


Abstract
The formulation of accurate clinical case definitions is an integral part of an effective process of public health surveillance.
Although such definitions should, ideally, be based on a standardized and fixed collection of defining criteria, they often require revision to reflect new knowledge of the condition involved and improvements in diagnostic testing.
Optimal case definitions also need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity that reflects their intended use.
After the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a technical consultation on global influenza surveillance.
This prompted improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition for influenza - i.e. a respiratory disease that lacks uniquely defining symptomology.
The revision process not only modified the definition of influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance interpretability.
To capture severe cases of influenza that required hospitalization, a new case definition was also developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age groups.
The new definitions have been found to capture more cases without compromising specificity.
Despite the challenge still posed in the clinical separation of influenza from other respiratory infections, the global use of the new WHO case definitions should help determine global trends in the characteristics and transmission of influenza viruses and the associated disease burden.


Abstract
There is an unmet need for greater investment in preparedness against major epidemics and pandemics.
This produced markedly higher estimates of the full value of loss that might occur as the result of a future pandemic.
We parametrized an exceedance probability function for a global influenza pandemic and estimated that the expected number of influenza-pandemic-related deaths is about 720 000 per year.
We calculated that the expected annual losses from pandemic risk to be about 500 billion United States dollars - or 0.6% of global income - per year.
This estimate falls within - but towards the lower end of - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's estimates of the value of the losses from global warming, which range from 0.2% to 2% of global income.
The estimated percentage of annual national income represented by the expected value of losses varied by country income grouping: from a little over 0.3% in high-income countries to 1.6% in lower-middle-income countries.
Most of the losses from influenza pandemics come from rare, severe events.

Abstract
The obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder with a high prevalence (2‑3 %), frequently causing a disabling condition.
Drug and psychotherapeutic treatment is generally effective.
However about 1/3 of the patients are treatment-resistant, suffering from chronic psychological distress with important sociofunctional repercussions.
The identification of dysfunctional neural networks in this disease opens the door to the use of neuromodulation techniques, as deep brain stimulation (DBS).
We discuss the clinical results of subthalamic nucleus DBS and the involvement of this nucleus in the pathophysiology of OCD.

Abstract
Fever is a common complaint in paediatric care and is mainly due to infectious causes.
Fever may also be due to inflammatory diseases.
A good knowledge of these aetiologies is essential to avoid unnecessary repeated antibiotic treatments and a lengthy misdiagnosis.


Abstract
The causes are multiple, classified into three major families : infectious, inflammatory and oncological.
Infectious causes are the most common and account for more than 50 % of cases.
The objective of this review is to guide physicians in charge of these patients throughout their management by focusing on the quest of infectious causes.


Abstract
Still's disease is a rare multifactorial disease associated with systemic inflammation.
Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult-onset Still's disease are both pediatric and respectively adult forms of the disease with a cut-off age of 16 years.
The disease is characterized by the following features : hectic fever > 39° C, arthralgia or arthritis, rash, neutrophilia and systemic inflammation.
The prognosis of the disease is functional and vital.
The evolution over time is variable : regression, evolution by relapses with regression at term and chronic joint evolution.
This focus describes the two forms of the disease, their complications and the therapeutic options.

We suggest that clinical management in this period should be revisited.


Abstract
Adolescence can be a particularly challenging period for individuals with a chronic health condition or disability.


Abstract
The 'forgotten years' of middle childhood, from age 6 to 12, represent a critical period in child development.
Emotional, social and physical development during this time have a lifelong impact on health and adult contributions to society.
Mental health conditions have displaced physical illness as the leading childhood disability.
Positive parenting can improve child behaviour, prevent early-onset conduct problems and provide a buffer from adverse childhood events resulting in decreased toxic stress and improved health.
Paediatricians need to explore the domains that promote healthy development, including caring environments, fundamental needs and nurturing relationships.

Abstract
Detecting atherosclerosis using imaging techniques is the subject of intense debate in the scientific community.
Among the arguments in favor of screening, a better identification or better stratification of cardiovascular risk is mentioned, compared to cardiovascular risk scores based solely on traditional risk factors, such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels.
However, several experts in recent years have challenged the clinical utility of these imaging techniques in asymptomatic adults.
This article proposes a debate « for or against » to describe the main arguments for or against the use of imaging for screening for atherosclerosis.

Abstract
Under the influence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol level, smoking or lifestyle, clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis manifest more or less early in life.
When cardiovascular risk factors accumulate, the risk of having a cardiovascular event increases and the benefits of prevention measures are greater.
This article summarizes existing strategies for controlling modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in primary prevention.
The physician can rely on an interprofessional network of cardiovascular prevention.
Managing risk factors while respecting the autonomy and priorities of the patient will bring the greatest benefit.


Abstract
Idiopathic immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA) is one of the most common immune-mediated diseases in dogs with a high mortality rate.
In this retrospective study, we examined the effect of mycophenolate- mofetil (MMF) and human intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) in combination with glucocorticoids on canine IMHA patients.
Six dogs were treated with prednisolone and MMF (hIVIG-) and in 15 patients hIVIG was added (hIVIG+).
There was no significant difference between the groups regarding age, weight, number of blood transfusions or hematocrit on the day of diagnosis.
The hIVIG+ group showed a significantly faster recovery of the hematocrit, but this difference was only short-lived.
The survival in the first year was similar in both groups and was with 71.5% somewhat higher than in other published studies.
The addition of MMF to prednisolone for the treatment of dogs with acute IMHA was well tolerated and seemed to positively affect the course of the disease.
Randomized studies are necessary to confirm this observation.
Human immunoglobulin had only minimal clinical advantages and no effect on mortality.

Abstract
This study examined attrition in an RCT and a PRCT.
Persons with insomnia were randomly assigned (n = 150) or allocated (n = 198) to the preferred treatment.
The overall attrition rate was higher in the RCT arm (46%) than in the PRCT arm (33%).
In both arms, differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were found between dropouts and completers.


Abstract
Participants received behavioural therapy for the management of insomnia randomly or by preference.
Exposure was assessed as attendance at the treatment sessions, enactment as self-reported application of treatment recommendations.
Participants (N = 262) attended a mean of 5.6 treatment sessions, applied the treatment recommendations frequently, and reported high levels of overall compliance.
There was no difference between the random and preference groups in terms of exposure to and enactment of treatment.

Abstract
Mi'kmaq women are reported to have lower rates of Papanicolaou (Pap) screening and higher rates of cervical cancer than non-Aboriginal women.
Community facilitators assisted with the research process.
Talking circles and individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Mi'kmaq women.
Also, health-care providers were interviewed in 2 Mi'kmaq communities.
Some women were accessing regular screening despite challenging personal circumstances.
The results highlight the need for nurses and other health-care providers to understand the uniqueness of each woman's experiences with Pap screening.
Improvements in screening rates depend on multifaceted nursing approaches developed in partnership with Mi'kmaq women.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to design an approach to supporting the development of gender- and Aboriginal-specific messages regarding the link between tobacco exposure and breast cancer, drawing on youth perspectives.
Focus groups were held with 18 girls (8 First Nations and Métis) and 25 boys (12 First Nations and Métis) to solicit advice in the design of messages.
Transcribed data were analyzed for themes.
Girls preferred messages that included the use of novel images, a personal story of breast cancer, and ways to avoid secondhand smoke.
Boys endorsed messages that were "catchy" but not "cheesy" and had masculine themes.
The results can be used as a guide in developing tailored health promotion messages.
Challenges in developing gender-appropriate messages for youth are described.

Abstract
Sexual health plays an important role in the well-being of university students.
The purpose of this scoping review was to gain a deeper understanding of the state of research on the sexual health knowledge of university/college students globally.
A 5-stage framework was used to guide the review and to characterize the literature on sexual health knowledge.
Articles published in English between 2000 and 2014 were reviewed if they included university students as a population of interest and described the methods used to measure sexual health knowledge.
Of the 2,386 articles retrieved, 91 met the criteria.
The majority of the articles (n = 79) used a cross-sectional design to investigate students' knowledge about HIV/AIDS (n = 45), STIs (n = 23), HPV (n = 9), and contraception (n = 24).
The review highlights gaps in the literature and in findings relating to the research dominance of various geographic locations, common research designs, the wide range of measurement tools used, and the variety of sexual health knowledge outcomes of interest.
The review provides a useful description of the literature on sexual health knowledge among university/college students and some recommendations for moving the field forward.


Abstract
These findings highlight the potential benefits of the NP-led outreach program for LTC residents and for the health-care system.

Abstract
Withdrawal of participants from intervention studies has dire methodological and clinical consequences.
Identifying factors that contribute to attrition may inform strategies to address the problem and prevent its consequences.
These criteria were met by 10 studies.
Attrition rates ranged from 10.8% to 77%.
A small number of demographic, clinical, behavioural, health, health-related beliefs, and logistical factors were related to attrition.
The report of high attrition rates underlines the importance of incorporating strategies to minimize attrition in smoking cessation studies.
Strategies to reduce attrition are proposed.


Abstract
This review is focused on the effectiveness of nursing interventions for patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

Abstract
An RN credential has been called "a ticket to the world."
In an increasingly globally oriented world, Canadian nurse graduates have many employment options.
This was a quantitative study guided by the Value-Expectancy Framework.
Data were collected through a Web-based self-report survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics for sample characteristics and t tests for comparison.
Nonprobability convenience sampling of graduating baccalaureate nursing students from a Canadian border region was used.
Of 130 respondents, 92 (70.8%) indicated that they were considering migrating from Canada for work.
Respondents believed that working abroad would provide more adventure, full-time work, professional development, appropriate staffing, flexible scheduling, and freedom to choose their preferred job sector/specialty.
Human resource planning will become increasingly important given the predicted nursing shortage and changes to nurse licensure in Canada with the potential to influence migration.

Knowledge about the beneficial effects of social support has not been used to systematically develop and evaluate interventions to help refugee new parents cope.
Qualitative and quantitative measures were used to understand experiences of participants and to assess the perceived psychosocial and health-related outcomes of the intervention.
The participants were 48 Sudanese and 37 Zimbabwean refugee parents in 2 Canadian provinces.
The authors conclude that there is a need for culturally appropriate nursing practices and programs for refugee new parents from diverse cultures.


Abstract
The participants' stories were analyzed for metaphors.
The tensions are fluid, although time and life experience facilitate a shift towards reconciliation.
An overarching metaphor across this group of survivors is shadows and sunshine: to survive and live in a fragile state, balancing multiple shadows such as stigma and side effects with joyful experiences of support and belonging.


Abstract
The work was guided by a 6-step methodological framework for scoping reviews.
Themes derived from the literature reflect stages of IENs' professional integration: pre-immigration and early arrival, professional recertification, workforce integration, and workplace integration.
Data were extracted, coded, and collated using electronic charts.
Numerical and qualitative thematic summaries were used to analyze the data.
Recommendations for research are as follows: create data systems to track IEN immigration and integration; determine the effectiveness of programs and policies for IENs; and examine the influence of language proficiency on professional recertification, workplace integration, and patient safety.


Abstract
While not dismissing the value of ethics review, they explore the tension of overlaying generic criteria for quantitative research, specifically randomized controlled trials, on nursing research from other traditions.


Abstract
This integrative literature review analyzes and synthesizes barriers to effective pain management and identifies areas for future investigation in a Canadian context.
Reframing pain education as a public health initiative could lead to sustainable improvement, as could the strengthening of partnerships between patients and health-care providers.
The delivery of high-quality care that encompasses effective pain management strategies must be a priority for nursing.


Abstract
A sample of 26 staff nurses on 3 units of a tertiary hospital in western Canada were observed and interviewed about how the manager affected their ability to do their work.
Grounded theory methodology was used.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to ascertain the information needs and knowledge-dissemination preferences of acute-care administrators with respect to advanced practice nursing (APN).
A survey tool was developed from the literature and from the findings of a qualitative study with acute-care leaders.
Of 107 surveys distributed to nursing administrators in 2 teaching hospitals, 79 (73.8%) were returned.
Researchers need multiple strategies for distributing context-specific APN evidence and information to nursing administrators.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of 3 types of radiation treatment on functions, bother, and well-being in men with prostate cancer at 1, 6, and 12 months after completion of treatment.
A repeated measures survey (N = 73) found that none of the function, bother, emotional, social, or functional well-being scores were significantly different among the 3 groups.
However, within-subjects-only repeated measures ANCOVA suggested that emotional well-being and social well-being are different over time.
The findings show that clinical treatment of prostate cancer has an impact on functions, bother, and well-being of patients.
Thus, it is important that nurses and other healthcare providers listen to what patients are saying before, during, and after treatment.


Abstract
The stories that emerged from the interviews raise questions about the nature of the gay community.
The findings centre on the participants' descriptions of (1) the heterosexual meta-culture, (2) the locales of gay life, and (3) unsupportive elements in the gay community.
Analysis of the interview data situates the gay community as a place of both inclusion and exclusion and as a heterogeneous environment.


Abstract
Pain arising from myocardial ischemia can be severe and anxiety-provoking.
Pain management during this time should be optimized in order to preserve vulnerable myocardial muscle.
This qualitative focus group study solicited the perspectives of ACS patients and emergency staff nurses on the rural patient experience of cardiac pain and anxiety and priorities and barriers to optimal assessment and management of ACS pain.
Patients described ACS pain as moderate to severe, with pain in the chest, arms, back, shoulders, and jaw.
Pain was well assessed and managed upon arrival in the emergency department but anxiety was not routinely assessed or treated.
Research related to ACS pain and anxiety management in the rural context is recommended.

Abstract
Since many years a correlation between neuropsychiatric disorders and eating disorders resulting in obesity is well established.
According to different studies, 1.2 - 4 % of patients scheduled for bariatric surgery are taking lithium as a mood stabilizer treatment for bipolar disorder.


Abstract
The transformations of the health system and the preferences of the patients themselves have led healthcare professionals to rethink the place and role of the patient in the healthcare system, putting the caregivercare relationship and communication at the heart of public health issues.
The literature shows that empathic communication is associated with better adherence to treatment, better patient satisfaction and less litigation.
However, the initial training programs of health professionals are little oriented towards this field.
Moreover, they are mainly based on a direct transition from theory to clinical practice with all the risks that this entails for patients.
Some recent studies suggest an interest in virtual reality simulation for the development of these communication skills.
This article offers an overview of the potential of virtual clinical simulation as a complementary or even alternative method to traditional teaching methods.
Different studies will illustrate these innovations in the training of physicians in clinical reasoning, empathic communication, and in a highly emotional situation such as breaking bad news.


Abstract
Differential diagnosis of lower limb oedema is a common exercise in clinical practice.


Abstract
In particular, I will elaborate on the psychotherapeutic techniques that were popular across the different countries and language cultures of the Soviet sphere, with a particular focus upon the Cold War period.
This article examines the literature on the mixed fortunes of psychoanalysis and group therapies in the region.
More specifically, it focuses upon the therapeutic modalities such as work therapy, suggestion and rational therapy, which gained particular popularity in the Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The latter two approaches had striking similarities with parallel developments in behavioural and cognitive therapies in the West.
In part, this was because clinicians on both sides of the 'iron curtain' drew upon shared European traditions from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Nevertheless, this article argues that in the Soviet sphere, those promoting these approaches appropriated socialist thought as a source of inspiration and justification, or at the very least, as a convenient political shield.


Abstract
Independent prescription of medicines and diagnostic test advice by final year medical students in Punjab.
Sale of medicines is not rigorously controlled in Pakistan.
Therefore, medical students start prescribing drugs and advising diagnostic tests before they graduate.
This cross-sectional study investigated the frequency of independent medical prescription by 180 stratified, randomly selected final year medical students from 3 public medical colleges in Punjab, Pakistan.
Data were obtained by self-administered questionnaire.
One hundred and twelve students had prescribed medicines independently without any supervision; 38 had performed a physical examination before prescribing; and 74 had advised and 49 interpreted diagnostic tests independently.
Forty-four students had administered injectable drugs and one third of these were administered without seeing expiry dates.
The most frequently prescribed drugs were nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (92%) and antibiotics (73%).
The most frequently advised tests were complete blood cell count, chest X-ray and urine detailed reports.
One hundred and twenty-seven participants thought that medical students should not prescribe drugs.
There was a significant relationship between gender and household income and prescription practices.
Many final year medical students had prescribed drugs and advised diagnostic tests before graduation.


Abstract

The aim of this study was to examine problems in integrating oral health services into PHC.
This was a qualitative research study comprising focus group discussions and interviews.
Audiotapes were transcribed following each session, and then a qualitative thematic analysis was carried out on gathered data.
This study provides a clearer understanding of the challenges of integrating oral health services into PHC.


Abstract
Genetic characterization of the Anopheles maculipennis complex (Diptera: Culicidae) in Morocco: a fundamental tool for malaria control.
The Anopheles maculipennis complex has been implicated in the transmission of malaria, which was endemic in Morocco until 2010.
Climate change, intensification of international travel and the permanent presence of the vector increase the risk of malaria re-emergence.
Eighty-six mosquito specimens were analyzed using PCR amplification of the ITS2 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 2) sequence of ribosomal DNA.
The ITS2 sequences of the mosquitoes were compared to those of the 7 species of the Maculipennis complex available in GenBank.
The results obtained confirm the presence of Anopheles labranchiae.
In order to enable technology transfer, DNA extraction and amplification steps are presented for the first time in detail, given the fact that the technique is still unknown to several Moroccan peripheral laboratories.


Abstract
Assessment of the quality of life in patients on haemodialysis in Iraq.
Chronic kidney disease requires life-long renal replacement therapy, which can greatly impair the quality of life (QOL) of patients.
This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the QOL of patients on haemodialysis, and the factors affecting it, at the dialysis unit of Basra General Hospital.
A total of 104 patients with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis were included.
Data were collected using the World Health Organization QOL questionnaire.
Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected.
Of the 104 patients, 57% were male, 73% were older than 45 years, 87% were of middle and low socioeconomic status, 70% had been on dialysis for more than 1 year, 74% had arteriovenous fistula vascular access, 34% had diabetes and 48% were positive for hepatitis virus.
All domains of QOL (physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment) were affected; the physical domain was the most severely affected.


Abstract
The aim of this study, was to investigate the trend of EBV infection in Bahrain over a 15-year period, 2001-2015.
The EBV serological results of 10 560 patients with possible EBV infection were evaluated.
Samples taken at the Salmaniya Medical Complex during 2001-2015 were included.
The presence or absence of EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, VCA IgM and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG antibodies was recorded.
The youngest seropositive patient was 11 months old.
Most primary infections occur between 1 and 5 years while most reactivation infections occur after the age of 25 years.
Serial surveillance of EBV infection is needed in Bahrain.
Measures to protect against EBV infections should be implemented.


Abstract
Investigation of breastfeeding training based on BASNEF model on the intensity of postpartum blues.
Postpartum blues is a major risk factor for the incidence of postpartum depression and disruption of breastfeeding.
This semi-experimental study investigated the effect of breastfeeding training based on the BASNEF model on severity of postpartum blues in 2012.
Four educational sessions based on the BASNEF model were held separately for pregnant women and their mothers, mothers-in-law and spouses.
The control group received routine care at the clinic.
After delivery, women's knowledge of and attitude towards postpartum blues were evaluated using the Zung Self- Rating Depression Scale.
There were significant differences between the groups regarding mean scores of knowledge, mothers' evaluation of behaviour outcomes, attitude, and enabling factors.
Also, the mean score for postpartum blues was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group.
In conclusion, training based on the BASNEF model had a positive effect on maternal knowledge and attitude and, consequently, the intensity of postpartum blues.
Further studies are required to determine the reliability and effectiveness of this method.


Abstract
Changes in dietary habits, physical activity and status of metabolic syndrome among expatriates in Saudi Arabia.
The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of living in Saudi Arabia on expatriate employees and their families' behavioural cardiovascular risk factors (BCVRFs), and to examine the association between changes in BCVRFs and metabolic syndrome (MetS).
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1437 individuals, aged ≥ 18 years, from King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Their mean age was 40.9 (11.7) years.
The prevalence of BCVRFs was as follows: tobacco use in 156 (11%), physical inactivity in 1049 (73%) low intake of fruit and vegetables in 1264 (88%) and MetS in 378 (26%).
Residing in Saudi Arabia had reduced physical activity and intake of fruit and vegetables.
There was also a significant increase in the fast food consumption.
In conclusion, living in Saudi Arabia had a significant negative effect on BCVRFs.
However, there was no statistically significant association between changes in fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity and MetS status, except that intake of fast food was lower among participants with MetS.


Abstract
Ethical reflections on the principle of patient autonomy.
In a world open to the movement of people, medical ethics is today associated with the area of loyal behavior of the practitioner and oriented in the patient's interest and accountability of each.
The universal vision of respect for the dignity of the sick person progresses.
Yet, many behaviours are sometimes illegitimate, but not in principle legally reprehensible.
One of the main principles marking the observance of patient consent is based on the autonomy given to the patient to decide for himself what appears to be adapted to his or her care.
The patient must be the one who makes the final decision on issues concerning them and doctors must act to respect it.
Therefore, they must accept that the patient has a different value system.


Abstract
Evaluation of vaccination efficiency against HBV among Syrian multitransfused patients.

Abstract
In this paper, we discuss various issues related to the concept of resilience, which is conventionally defined as a dynamic process allowing for a positive adaptation in a context of significant adversity.
First, we try to draw the reader's attention to the importance of the concept of resilience in terms of public health.
Second, we address the difficulty of measuring resilience in a relevant and operational manner.
Third, we then address the question of whether resilience can be conceived only in the context of a confrontation with trauma, or whether its application can be relevant to the everyday nontraumatic adversity.
In this regard, we introduce and define another coping strategy which is the Sense of Coherence (SOC).
Fourth, we discuss the nature of resilience, that is to say, whether it should be considered as a personality trait or as an aptitude.
We try to show that this problem arises from the difficulty to specify the emotional processes involved in resilience.
Finally, we propose future research perspectives that should allow us to better understand the concept of resilience.


Abstract
Adolescents and young adults are at particularly at-risk population in mental health.
For a large majority of patients suffering from chronic psychiatric condition, the age of onset of psychiatric symptoms is less than 24 years, while the coverage in psychiatric care is the lowest between 16 and 24.
Presenting a psychiatric pathology during childhood and adolescence constitutes an independent risk factor for the occurrence of adverse life events in adulthood.
Transition is the deliberate and planned movement from CAMHS to AMHS.
CAMHS and AMHS struggle to achieve optimal transitions between them.
Many barriers exist at the interface of the two types of structure and some young people who require continuous care during this period do not have access to it.
There are also too few specific psychiatric services for the population of adolescents and young adults.
Some recommendations emerge to intend to guide practices, but the literature lacks data to better define this population and build guidelines about the transition between CAMHS and AMHS and about specific services for adolescents and young adults in psychiatry.


Abstract
The medico-psycho-social determinants of teenager's mental health enjoin us to support a holistic analysis of these situations.
Different analysis spectra - symptomatic, environnemental, anthropological, cultural - allow us to understand a situation at different levels of interpretation.


Abstract
Its efficacy is probable in depression and must still be confirmed in numerous other indications.
Lowcost devices for the general public are easy to find on the internet and are frequently used for non-therapeutic indications, like the improvement of video gamers' performances.
A non-medical use could represent a public health hazard, due to lack of control on stimulation parameters i.e. localization, duration and intensity.


Abstract
Acromioclavicular dislocation is a frequent pathology commonly encountered in traumatology.
Therefore, its management is generally standardized, guided by clinical and radiological evaluation.
This can range from conservative treatment by limb immobilization and functional rehabilitation, to surgical treatment by using minimally invasive techniques.
We present the particular case of a 74-year-old patient with an acromioclavicular dislocation associated with a non-displaced fracture of the coracoid process as well as of the spine of the scapula.
This article aims to describe the diagnostic traps as well as discuss the treatment options for this complex presentation.


Abstract
Millions of people, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, lack access to effective pharmaceuticals, often because they are unaffordable.
The 2001 Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopted the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement and Public Health.
The declaration recognized the implications of intellectual property rights for both new medicine development and the price of medicines.
The aim of this study was to document the use of TRIPS flexibilities to access lower-priced generic medicines between 2001 and 2016.
The remainder were: 1 case of parallel importation; 3 research exceptions; and 32 non-patent-related measures.
Of the 176 instances, 152 (86.4%) were implemented.
They covered products for treating 14 different diseases.
However, 137 (77.8%) concerned medicines for human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome or related diseases.
The use of TRIPS flexibilities was found to be more frequent than is commonly assumed.
Given the problems faced by countries today in procuring high-priced, patented medicines, the practical, legal pathway provided by TRIPS flexibilities for accessing lower-cost generic equivalents is increasingly important.


Abstract
Many low- and middle-income countries facing high levels of antimicrobial resistance, and the associated morbidity from ineffective treatment, also have a high burden of tuberculosis.
Over recent decades many countries have developed effective laboratory and information systems for tuberculosis control.
In this paper we describe how existing tuberculosis laboratory systems can be expanded to accommodate antimicrobial resistance functions.
We show how such expansion in services may benefit tuberculosis case-finding and laboratory capacity through integration of laboratory services.
We further summarize the synergies between high-level strategies on tuberculosis and antimicrobial resistance control.
These provide a potential platform for the integration of programmes and illustrate how integration at the health-service delivery level for diagnostic services could occur in practice in a low- and middle-income setting.


Abstract
The World Health Organization has recommended that Member States consider taxing energy-dense beverages and foods and/or subsidizing nutrient-rich foods to improve diets and prevent noncommunicable diseases.
For example, as health and economic policy-makers have different administrative concerns, performance indicators and priorities, they often consider different forms of evidence in their decision-making.
In this paper, we describe the evidence base for diet-related interventions based on fiscal policies and consider the key questions that need to be asked by both health and economic policy-makers.
From the health sector's perspective, there is most evidence for the impact of taxes and subsidies on diets, with less evidence on their impacts on body weight or health.
We highlight the importance of scope, the role of industry, the use of revenue and regressive taxes in informing policy decisions.


Abstract
The One Health concept covers the interrelationship between human, animal and environmental health and requires multistakeholder collaboration across many cultural, disciplinary, institutional and sectoral boundaries.
Yet, the implementation of the One Health approach appears hampered by shortcomings in the global framework for health governance.
Knowledge integration approaches, at all stages of policy development, could help to address these shortcomings.


Abstract
Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is an uncommon benign mesenchymal tumor of the breast.
Majority occur as diffuse lesions, and diagnosis is often incidental or in a background of other breast pathologies.
Bilaterality with multiple tumoral masses in giant breasts is a rarity.
We report a 34-year-old nonlactating female with 2-year history of rapid progressive painless bilateral enlargement of the breasts following surgical excision of ill-defined breast lumps which were not subjected to histopathological evaluation a year earlier.
Examination revealed bilateral nontender giant breasts extending to the umbilical area with masses which were not attached to overlying skin, Grade 2 pressure ulcers on the lateral posterior breast aspects bilaterally and peau d'orange.
There were no other palpable masses or lymph nodes.
A clinical assessment of bilateral gigantomastia was made.
Bilateral mastectomy revealed giant PASH which was confirmed with positive immunohistochemical reactivity for CD34 and vimentin.
No other breast pathologies were seen with extensive sectioning.
Diffuse multiple breast lesions with incomplete excision are associated with rapid growth in PASH as seen in this case.
The presence of concurrent bilateral giant tumoral masses without any underlying breast pathology is a novelty.
The mainstay of treatment in this case is mastectomy despite its benign nature.


Abstract
Association of dengue fever with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis in pediatric age group is a rare entity.
We describe a case of 15 year old adolescent male who presented with dengue fever and in whom symptoms of transverse myelitis developed 4 weeks after fever (post-infectious stage).
Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis involving dorso-lumbar cord.
Patient recovered almost completely with minimal residual neurological deficit after a six weeks course of corticosteroids and supportive management including physiotherapy.

Abstract
Local and systemic treatments have significantly improved the prognosis of patients with breast cancer.
The diagnosis of the disease and its sometimes long-lasting treatments can, however, impair the sexual life of patients.
This contributes to a deterioration of their quality of life and can also lead to an alteration of their therapeutic adhesion and therefore of their prognosis.
For a long time, the subject remained taboo and little discussed between professionals and patients.

Abstract
Obesity is associated with elevated levels of triglycerides, sometimes LDL-cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol.
Physicians must review the intake of carbohydrates as well, by limiting added sugars and increasing dietary fibers (vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes and nuts).


Abstract
Bariatric and metabolic surgery (BMS) is currently the cornerstone of treatment for severe obesity.
This leads to a reduction in cardiovascular risk and mortality.
Any BMS must be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, which will ensure lifelong follow-up in order to optimize results and prevent complications, including micronutrient deficiencies, by adequate supplementations.


Abstract
Obesity is a chronic, complex and relapsing disease.


Abstract
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, is the epicenter of an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, characterized by low rates of medication adherence and retention in care.
Social workers may have a unique role to play in improving DR-TB-HIV outcomes.
We designed, implemented and evaluated a model-based pilot training course on patient-centered care, treatment literacy in DR-TB and HIV coinfection, patient support group facilitation, and self-care.
Ten social workers participated in a 1-day training course.
Post-training questionnaire scores showed significant overall gains (P = 0.003).


Abstract
This descriptive study enrolled 229 first-time testers.
Participants completed an electronic questionnaire.

Wanting 'to know my status' and the immediate opportunity to test were reported as drivers of testing (41% and 35%, respectively).


Abstract
Betablockers are used for decades in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
Recently, the repurposing of the wide spectrum betablocker propranolol revolutionized the infantile hemangioma management.
Besides, betablockers have been shown to significantly improve the prognosis of melanoma patients.
Blocking the adrenergic receptors blocks the stress-induced tumorigenic pathways.
Propranolol inhibits melanoma by downregulating the tumor angiogenesis but also tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness and local immune suppression.
These antitumor effects have been observed in other cancers.
The repurposing of propranolol has already changed the practice of pediatricians and dermatologists and may soon help oncologists treat various cancers.


Abstract
Moreover we give a brief overview of the management of these nail pathologies.


Abstract
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory dermatitis for which molecular research is currently extending.
Mostly mediated by helper T lymphocytes type 2 (Th2), it seems that Th22 and Th17 can also be involved on a smaller scale.
An IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor, key cytokines of the Th2 pathway, has recently been recognized as a new treatment for AD and has opened the field to multiple clinical trials for other selective immunosuppressants such as biologics and small molecules.
These advances make us hope for the development of more effective and better-tolerated treatments than conventional immunosuppressants.
In addition, they promise to advance the knowledge of this complex inflammatory pathology and its clinical subtypes.

It is a concept that is now anchored in the minds of most modern practitioners.


Abstract
The non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) has recently been added in our clinical practice.
Sensitivity and specificity of this method in the common fetal aneuploidies screening is about 99 %.
This technique remains a screening test, not a diagnosis test, because false positive or negative results exist.
The discordant results are explained by the method itself witch analyses the whole free circulating DNA in the maternal blood: the fetal DNA from trophoblastic cells lysing but also the maternal DNA.
Placenta confined mosaic is the main false positive cause reported in the literature.
NIPT can rarely reveal maternal abnormalities.
We are reporting two cases carrying a cytogenetic anomaly revealed with NIPT: microduplication of 22q11.2 and a sexual chromosomes anomaly.

Despite what is sometimes communicated, the risk of transmission of this type of bacteria outside of a hospital environment is real.
Standard precautions are the key to minimizing this risk.
In a number of situations in the ambulatory setting, MDRO screening (nasal or rectal) is needed and recommended.


Abstract
Scaling up prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Surveillance is an essential component in the campaign to prevent and control noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), both globally and in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR).
In order to address the increasing burden from these diseases, countries must first evaluate their own systems and see what steps need to be taken to improve preparedness.
Ten progress indicators cover governance and planning, reducing risk factors and healthcare provision.
While the criteria used to assess some of the indicators have been updated over this period, many categories still show strong improvements.
However, others still require extensive work if countries are to meet the sustainable development goal of reducing by 25% the number of premature deaths from NCDs by the year 2025.


Abstract
Tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship in entertainment media: a phenomenon requiring stronger controls in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Tobacco use and placement of tobacco products in television (TV) productions and movies is a way to promote tobacco use while avoiding tobacco advertising bans that exist in most countries.
The fact that such productions are broadcast widely and viewed by millions, including children and young people, is of concern.
This paper reviews the evidence on the use of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) in TV and films in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and the ways to combat it.
Evidence from Egypt shows considerable and increasing use of tobacco products by actors on screen, including female actors, in programmes aired during Ramadan in 2015-2017.
A study of Iranian movies in 2015 showed that tobacco scenes in Iranian movies were increasing.
In 2014, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean held a consultative meeting on TAPS in drama.
The consultation recommended regulating the tobacco presence in movies and TV through complete implementation of Article 13 of the WHO FCTC, and raising the issue to the WHO FCTC Conference of the Parties.
In 2016, the Conference of the Parties called on parties to consider scaling up the implementation of WHO FCTC Article 13 and monitoring the use of TAPS in entertainment media in accordance with national legislation.
A comprehensive approach is essential to end the tobacco industry's use of TV productions and movies to promote their products.


Abstract
Review of the nutrition situation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
This situation analysis for the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region focuses on specific nutrition indicators, namely low birth weight, exclusive breastfeeding, under- and overnutrition (anthropometric indicators) and anaemia.
The regional average prevalence of low birth weight and exclusive breastfeeding was estimated at 19.31% and 29.3%, respectively.
Stunting, wasting and underweight had an average prevalence of 28%, 8.69% and 18%, respectively.
Afghanistan, Djibouti, Pakistan, Sudan and Yemen had the highest burden of stunting (> 30%).
Prevalence of anaemia ranged from 7.4% to 88% in children aged < 5 years and from 19.9% to 63% in women of childbearing age.
Of concern is the increasing trend in overweight and obesity among adults and children.
Average prevalence of overweight and obesity was 27% and 24% in adults and 16.5% and 4.8% in school-aged children, respectively.
The highest levels of obesity were reported from Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
This review highlights the double burden of malnutrition in countries of the Region and calls for the prioritization of policies aimed at improving the population's nutritional status.


Abstract
The development of the noncommunicable diseases emergency health kit.
The noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) emergency health kit was developed in response to the growing prevalence of NCDs in low and middle-income countries.
Under conditions of conflict or following natural disasters, regular treatment of this category of diseases is often disrupted and rarely prioritized.
This leads to greater morbidity and mortality both in the short and long term.
The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has both a high incidence of NCDs and currently is the site of several major conflicts and hosts most of the world's refugees.
Therefore, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean initiated the development of the NCD emergency health kit to provide a structured set of medications, equipment and renewables to supply the needs of a population of 10 000 people over a period of 3 months following disruption of normal medical services.
This report discusses the rationale and anticipated use of the NCD emergency health kit followed by the selection criteria, structure, content and quantification process of the kit.
Finally, the next steps are examined, including the procurement, logistics and monitoring and evaluation process of the kit.


Abstract
GABRIC Diabetes School: an innovative education centre for people with diabetes.
Diabetes prevalence and deaths attributable to diabetes continue to rise across globally.
In the Islamic Republic of Iran, there are currently limited structured educational programmes and no national standards for DSME/S protocol.
In addition, GABRIC has developed a database registry with more than 100 000 members throughout the country, of whom 95% are diabetic with a proportion of 82% Type 2 diabetes and 13% Type 1 diabetes.
The success of the GABRIC school model results is yet to be investigated through study trials, and offers a fruitful line of research.


Abstract
Children's mental health in Canada is characterized by high needs coupled with stark service shortfalls.
In Ontario and in many provinces, addressing these shortfalls is hampered by the absence of a measurement system, something that researchers have long called for.
This commentary aims to review the issues and suggest prospects for improving the measurement of children's mental health in Ontario and elsewhere.
We then explore some of the issues that constrain policy and that need to be overcome, and suggest prospects for change - for advancing the measurement of children's mental health in Ontario and Canada.


Abstract
The Unité Santé Jeunes of the Geneva University Hospitals offers multidisciplinary care to young people between the ages of 12 years and 25 years, including unaccompanied minor migrant adolescents.
The psychiatrist and child psychiatrist of the unit participate actively.


Abstract
An unaccompanied minor is a young person under 18 years of age separated from both parents and who is not cared for by an adult invested of this responsability by law or the custom.
Their number has increased in Switzerland in 2015, prompting medical and social professionals to adapt their care to respond more appropriately to their needs.
Specific elements of an initial health check for these young people, transcultural skills and a good knowledge of the network are necessary to provide optimal management.
We propose an integrative and transversal understanding of this transition by exploring relationships with the community, associative, social, educational and mental health.


Abstract
Social determinants have an impact on patients' access to care and on their health at any age.


Abstract
Functional disorder during adolescence is a very complex problem too often limited to a psychological origin.
Its pathogenesis remains unclear but it definitively associates individual and environmental factors.
Recent data show anatomo-functional evidence of neural networks of the brain that is involved in pain and its psychological representation as well as the representation of pain in the body.


Abstract
Parents are often reluctant to discuss sexuality and romantic relationships with their teenagers.
However, these discussions can have a strong impact on their children's health.
Care providers can act as a reliable source of information to support parents in this task.


Abstract
This qualitative research article is based on interviews with 20 participants to a low back pain rehabilitation program in a Swiss hospital.
It shows that, in the absence of the obvious cause that can explain pain, patients construct their own interpretations and explanations in order to give meaning to their experience.
Their explanatory models mainly include the lifestyle and the physical aspects related to the body function, what leaves little room for the psychosocial component.
Their interpretation is consequently discordant with the current medical approach, which considers that chronic low back pain results from bio-psycho-social factors.
This discrepancy implies negotiation between patients and professionals about the objectives to achieve in order to treat pain.

Delayed antibiotics prescription might be considered in some specific circumstances.


Abstract
Radiculopathy is a constellation of symptoms secondary to a pathology affecting the nerve root, the most frequent cause of which is a herniated intervertebral disc.
However, a psoas hematoma was also noted.
Biological assessments revealed a hemostasis disorder.
The final clinical diagnosis was a spontaneous hematoma caused by anticoagulant overdose.
Psoas hematomas usually occur in patients with coagulopathy.


Abstract
In post hoc analyses of subgroups of patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes, thiazide(-like) diuretics resulted in a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure compared to placebo.
Furthermore, they were shown to be non-inferior to other antihypertensive agents, including blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in diabetic patients without albuminuria.


Abstract
We report a clinical case characterized by lumbar and pelvic abscesses, before addressing in detail the different types of skeletal involvement related to tuberculosis, through a review of the literature.


Abstract
The endothelium plays a vital role as part of the cardiovascular continuum.
Risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia unbalance angiotensin II - bradykinin homeostasis, leading to endothelial dysfunction and changes in vascular structure that promote atherosclerosis and thrombosis.
Increasing levels of bradykinin is an effect of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), and also a fundamental part of their mode of action.
The cardiovascular protection observed with ACE-I, and not with sartans, can be explained rationally by the specific effects of bradykinin on the endothelium.
In the pharmacological class of ACE-Is, perindopril likely produces the strongest effects on bradykinin, which may explain, at least in part, the documented superiority of this drug in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.


Abstract
At present, it is recognized that screening for frailty in the elderly is a major public health issue.


Abstract
Fiasp® is insulin aspart (NovoRapid®) in which two excipients (L-arginine and niacinamide) have been added, L-arginine serving as a stabilising agent, while niacinamide being responsible for accelerated initial absorption after subcutaneous administration.
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of insulin faster aspart have the potential to better reproduce the fast endogenous prandial insulin secretion and thereby to improve postprandial glucose control compared with insulin aspart.
The onset phase 3 programme compares head-to-head insulin faster aspart to insulin aspart.
Studies showed significant reductions in postprandial glucose increment (in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C, in type 1 diabetes), without markedly increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia.


Abstract
The World Health Assembly in 2014 adopted a resolution that recognized the importance of increasing access to biotherapeutic products, of improving their affordability and of ensuring their quality, safety and efficacy.
Biosimilars are biotherapeutic products similar to already licensed reference products and are usually developed after patents on the original products have expired.
Their introduction into the market is likely to reduce the costs of medicines substantially, thereby improving the availability of treatment for patients.
However, there are barriers to market access for biosimilars.
This article discusses the factors that give rise to these barriers and explains the importance of regulatory oversight throughout the product life-cycle of biosimilars.


Abstract
Our understanding of Parkinson's disease has considerably evolved in the last few years.


Abstract
Movement disorders of monogenic origin are rare.
For some genetic movement disorders there is specific treatment available.
The most common movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, have probably a complex etiology, including polygenic and environmental factors.
Less than 5 % of Parkinsonian patients have a monogenic, hereditary form of the disease.


Abstract
Sleep is characterized, from a behavioral point of view, by a physical quiescence.
However, sleep can be disrupted by movements which can occur before falling asleep, during the sleep-wake transition, or during sleep.
Some of these movements may be considered quasi-physiological because they are very common in the general population and have little or no clinical impact.
However, others may have an impact on sleep quality, or be associated with other neurological conditions.
Patients ' symptoms and complaints, the movements' description by witnesses, home video and video-polysomnographic recordings in the sleep laboratory allow to establish the diagnosis.
The instauration of a treatment should be guided by clinical repercussions.


Abstract
Each topic is illustrated with a case report.

Significant differences between the techniques were seen at the pulmonic and tricuspid valves.


Abstract
Thirty dogs were treated with (TXA group) and 25 dogs without (CTR group) tranexamic acid prior to surgery.
Groups were similar at presentation and prior to surgery.
None of the dogs undergoing rotational thromboelastography analysis showed hyperfibrinolysis prior to surgery.
Overall transfusion and erythrocyte transfusion requirements as well as bleeding tendency, hospitalisation time and hospital discharge rate were similar between groups.
Dogs of the TXA group received significantly more intraoperative plasma transfusions (P=0.013) and showed a higher systolic and mean arterial blood pressure (P=0.002 and 0.050) and lower shock index (P=0.028) with less dogs being in shock (P=0.012) at 24h.

Koro syndrome is a psychiatric disorder specific to certain Asian cultures.
It is characterized by acute and intense anxiety with fear of a retraction of the penis into the body and resultant death.


Abstract
The present chapter deals with the contribution of Professor Paul A.
Bastenie, as Chief of the Department of Medicine of the Saint-Pierre Hospital and Director of the Laboratory of Experimental Medicine at Brussels Free University, in the field of diabetes with emphasis on the role of insulin in glucose homeostasis.
The knowledge and experimental work under consideration is covering the period from 1955 to 1974.
They entail not only three treatises contributed by Bastenie but also fundamental and clinical investigations, such as those presented in eight doctoral dissertations submitted for aggregation examination at Brussels Free University.
Rasio), the regulation of the extra-hepatic metabolism of ketone bodies in anesthetized dogs (E.O. Balasse) and the use of radioiodinated insulin as tracers in biology (H.A. Ooms).


Abstract
In Switzerland, 20 % of the population travel to the tropics every year and many have unprotected sexual practices during their stay.
A third of newly diagnosed HIV infections among Swiss citizens are acquired abroad.
Travels are a risk factor of HIV viral rebound and antiretroviral treatment failure, particularly in sub-Saharan African patients.


Abstract
The number of immunosuppressed travelers has exponentially increased in the past few years.

Advancements in technology have led to the development of medical applications (Apps) and websites.


Abstract
As part of the epidemiological surveillance of malaria, cases reported in Geneva during the period 2005‑2016 were analyzed and compared to a similar retrospective study covering the period 1998‑2004.
A total of 600 cases were reported, averaging 50 cases per year.


Abstract
Although rarely diagnosed in Switzerland, urinary tract schistosomiasis is common in the migrants' regions of origin, such as sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
The diagnosis of urinary schistosomiasis should be especially suspected in case of terminal haematuria and eosinophilia in patients with a history of skin exposure to fresh water in endemic areas.
The diagnosis is based on the identification by microscope of schistosome eggs or miracidia (a less common form of the Schistosoma sp lifecycle) in urine.
The established treatment consists of praziquantel 40 mg/kg as single dose to be repeated at one month.


Abstract
Antidepressants and psychotherapy play a prominent role in patient management.
In recent years, many studies have shown that physical activity also reduces depressive symptoms.
Among mechanisms involved in the antidepressant effects of exercise, a recent study based on animal models of depression suggests that lactate may contribute to reducing depressive symptoms in response to physical activity.
Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of lactate may contribute to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of depression.


Abstract
Several studies have described the condition of asylum seekers as being on the threshold or in-between structures.
This article argues that the condition of liminality provides an intensified doubleness of impossibility and possibility for action, which casts a different light on conceptualizing agency.
Without disregarding the downside of this liminal, in-between condition, the article shows that the lack of 'normalized' connectedness to the new structure combined with physical distance from the past structure, enables reflection and feeds the power of imagination.
This can lead to alternative (yet conditional) forms of agency, such as delayed agency and agency from marginal positions.
Considering these sources of agency has great implications for the short-term well-being of asylum seekers and the long-term inclusion of refugees in their countries of residence.


Abstract
Visits to mark the end of the pediatric follow-up and the beginning of the GP follow-up should be systematically offered to young people with special needs.


Abstract
Among the health strategies to respond to the aging of the population, initiatives for the screening and management of age-related health issues are implemented, including in family medicine.


Abstract
Lack of coordination of the different actors can lead to repeated loss of the continuum of care.
Each transition requires better communication between healthcare providers and also with the patient.
Improving communication skills could improve the definition of care goals, support family caregivers, facilitate early contact with a palliative care team, and better respect patient choices.


Abstract
This seems largely insufficient given the diversity of tasks and skills to master.
The authors formulate a step by step approach based on their experience as those of other colleagues in order to facilitate such transition.


Abstract
This article presents a brief selection of studies published since early 2017 that explore various aspects of the functioning and organization of family medicine around the world.
The duration of consultation in family medicine varies widely around the world, from less than 5 minutes to more than 20 minutes.
Pay-for-performance in family medicine is a system that is currently struggling to convince.
Finally, change of practices is a complex process that should be based on several combine interventions and medium-term follow-up.


Abstract
Knee osteoarthritis is a frequent diagnosis in family medicine.
Initial assessment can be simple, but it should be done rigorously and early when symptoms appear.
There are ways to slow down osteoarthritis progression : weight reduction, physiotherapy, correction of misalignment.
Surgery can be proposed when symptoms become refractory.
The mainstay of care is the education of the patient and exploration of his representations, which must guide physicians during follow-up.


Abstract
Application of synthetic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibitors, such as doxycycline is one of the possible therapeutic options for osteoarthritis.
The FLSs were established from synovial fluids of clinically normal metacarpophalangeal joints of 6 skeletally mature horses.


Abstract
On-farm biosecurity measures are an important part of a control plan to minimize the introduction and spread of infectious diseases, such as equine influenza, in an equine facility.
It can be challenging, however, to evaluate the efficacy of biosecurity measures under field conditions.


Abstract
Using a prospective study canine blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected in 24 dogs with neurological signs after undergoing brain MRI.
Dogs were divided in 2 groups.
No significant difference between serum lactate (1.57 ± 0.9 mmol/L) and CSF lactate concentration (1.34 ± 0.3 mmol/L) was detected.


Abstract
Studies in humans have shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the insulin-like growth factor axis are involved in carcinogenesis, thus, components of these systems might be useful as prognostic markers and constitute potential therapeutic targets.
In veterinary medicine, only a few studies exist on this topic.
Here, serum concentrations of 26S proteasome (26SP) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured by canine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 43 dogs suffering from malignant tumors and 21 clinically normal dogs (control group).
Relationships with tumor size, survival time, body condition score (BCS), and tumor entity were assessed.
The median 26SP concentration in the tumor group was non-significantly higher than in the control group.
However, dogs with mammary carcinomas displayed significantly increased 26SP levels compared to the control group and dogs with tumor size less than 5 cm showed significantly increased 26SP concentrations compared to dogs with larger tumors and control dogs.
26SP concentrations were not correlated to survival time or BCS.
No significant difference in IGF-1 levels was found between the tumor group and the control group; however, IGF-1 concentrations displayed a larger range of values in the tumor group.
Dogs with tumors greater than 5 cm showed significantly higher IGF-1 levels than dogs with smaller tumors.
The IGF-1 concentrations were positively correlated to survival time, but no correlation with BCS was found.
Consequently, serum 26SP concentrations seem to be increased in some dogs suffering from malignant tumors, especially in dogs with mammary carcinoma and smaller tumors.
Increased serum IGF-1 concentrations could be an indication of large tumors and a poor prognosis.

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine in combination with epinephrine or dexmedetomidine after intraperitoneal administration in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy.


Abstract
The efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated against a commercial baculovirus-expressed recombinant PCV2 subunit vaccine based on the Cap protein.
The amino acid sequence of this Cap protein was designed based on the alignment of amino acid sequences from different isolates from Europe, North America, and Asia.
The vaccine was evaluated in either phosphate-buffered saline or adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, cobalt oxide, or liposome.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of hip and elbow dysplasia in a group of growing Labrador retrievers fed a fish-based diet enriched with nutraceuticals with chondroprotective properties.
The puppies ranged from 3 to 12 mo of age and were divided into 2 groups, each fed a different diet.
Hip and elbow joints were radiographed and scored at 6 and 12 mo of age.
Overall, 42 dogs completed the study.
At 12 mo of age, no differences were found between the groups in the prevalence of hip and elbow dysplasia, although dogs fed the fish-based food enriched with nutraceuticals had a less severe grade of osteoarthritis at 12 mo.
It was concluded that the fish-based diet with nutraceuticals did have beneficial effects on the development of severe osteoarthritis.


Abstract
Our hypothesis was that PVF would be restored to Baseline (intact) at the end of the follow-up.
Fifteen (> 20 kg) mixed-breed dogs were included in this study.
Cranial cruciate ligament was transected on Day (D) 0 followed by lateral suture stabilization at D28.
When compared to Baseline, the PVF was significantly decreased at D14, D26, and D91.


Abstract
The current study assessed youth and young adults' perceptions and attitudes toward caffeine and energy drinks (EDs).
An online survey was conducted with 2036 panelists aged 12-24, about caffeine and ED knowledge, caffeine perceptions, and perceptions of ED safety.
When shown four beverages, only 17.5% correctly identified the beverage with the most caffeine.
Overall, young people generally have low levels of knowledge about caffeine amounts and intake from caffeinated beverages.


Abstract
Hemolysis (from the Greek word: hemolysis: hema = blood + lysis = liberation) is a medical term that describes red blood cell's destruction by mechanisms of lysis of the membrane.
An hemolytic anemia occurs when excessive destruction of red blood cells overwhelms bone marrow's capacity of regeneration.
Although anemia is frequently associated with an oncologic disease, hemolytic anemia is rarely diagnosed in oncologic patients.
Consequently, a massive hemolysis can be quickly deleterious and often fatal.
An early diagnosis can improve survival and can be made with inexpensive tests.
In this article, we present the different types of hemolytic anemia associated with oncologic diseases, their mechanism and the treatment propositions depending on the etiology.


Abstract
Knowledge about cancer biology is extending and has meaningful repercussions on patients' care.
Therefore, there is a growing need to assess tumor biology not only at diagnosis, but also throughout the course of management.
Advances in biotechnology allow currently getting more and more information from liquid biopsies, based on small amounts of tumor material released for instance into the peripheral blood.
Already used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers, these new techniques represent more generally an important step forward for personalized oncology.


Abstract
Despite this treatment, patient survival has remained stable over the last 20 years.
Recently, advances in the sequence, regimens, and route of administration of treatment have enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity.
Targeted anti-angiogenic therapy and recently PARP inhibitors are now complementing standard treatment and have improved patient progression-free survival.
The development of immunotherapy, alone or in combination, brings new perspectives for the future treatment of ovarian cancer.

Based on photographs representing paths, the representations between patients and professional caregivers vary.


Abstract
The ECG provides information about heart rhythm and myocardial integrity, including the atria.
The sinus P wave exhibits a 0‑90° axis and a generally biphasic morphology in lead V1.
An amplitude >2 mm in lead II and >1 mm in lead V1 is a specific sign of right atrial enlargement, often related to pulmonary disease or pulmonary hypertension.
Interatrial block (IAB) is defined as a P-wave ≥120 ms with, in the advanced form, a biphasic morphology in inferior leads.
It is most commonly seen in the context of advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors, coronary artery disease or valvulopathies.
IAB is a risk factor for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, stroke, left ventricular dysfunction and mortality.
The identification of a P-wave abnormality has prognostic implications and should trigger the search for associated conditions.


Abstract
The indication of PFO closure is based on a multidisciplinary decision involving neurologists, cardiologists and hemostasis specialists.
In addition, atrial fibrillation (AF) should systematically be excluded.
The procedural complication rate is low.


Abstract
More recently, new data has also shown that among patients at intermediate risk, TAVI is at least as beneficial as surgical valve replacement.

Abstract
Given the minimal donor site morbidity and recovery of ankle dorsiflexion, this report underscores the importance of considering early nerve transfers in cases of high peroneal neuropathy due to an intraneural ganglion cyst.


Abstract
The average age in this study was 23 years.
Our findings, even with the caveats known to this study, suggest that there is still a high number of patients with burn injury requiring hospital admission.


Abstract
Burns are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and an important public health problem in Iraq.
The current study was undertaken to describe epidemiological characteristics of hospitalized burn patients and investigate in-hospital mortality.
Data were extracted from all accessible files, entered into Epidata and analyzed in Stata.
Hospital records of 367 patients with an age range of 1 month to 77 years and a male to female ratio of 1:2 were analyzed.
In-hospital mortality was 22% and the independent factors for death were TBSA and suicidal burns.


Abstract
The study of burn flora is helpful in determining current antibiotic susceptibilities and locating development of multidrug resistant bacterial strains among the unit's usual flora.
Mean hospital stay was 14.41 days (range 0-64 days).
Burn wound infection was present in 38.54%.
The most frequent species was Staphylococcus spp.
The most frequent disseminated bacteria was Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the most sensitive antibiotic was Amikacin.
More than 39.2% of our positive culture patients had 3 or more positive cultures, and 36.5% had similar culture results for one bacteria, which was a sign of disseminated infection.


Abstract
The present study examined the effectiveness of an automated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-based alarm system for the early detection of sepsis in adult burn patients.
In this prospective observational study, we included 41 consecutive patients who were admitted to our burn ICU within a one-year period.


Abstract
Male:female ratio was 4.1:1.
Amputations were required in 18 (23%), skin grafting in 52 (67%) and flap cover in 29 (37%) patients.
There were unfavourable outcomes in 32% patients with a mortality rate of 7.8%.


Abstract
Burning is a major health challenge in all societies.
In this descriptive cross-sectional study, health information about hospitalized burn patients was extracted from the hospital information system from April 2009 to February 2015.
Logistic regression method was used to identify risk factors and mortality predictors.
Lethal area index (LA50) was investigated to evaluate the quality of annual hospital medical care.
A total of 7725 patient medical files were examined.
Mean age of the patients was 32.3±22.5 years old.
The most common cause of burning accidents was hot liquids.
Mean percentage of total body surface area was 15.8±17.9%.
The most and the least common affected areas were upper parts and posterior thorax, respectively.
Total calculated LA50 was 56.22 (CI95% = 50.09-62.20).
This index was 43.89%, 46.43%, 52.29%, 52.29%, 57.00%, 62.08% and 67.53% annually from 2009 to 2015, respectively.
There was a statistically significant difference with regards to mortality rate in the different age groups, higher-degree burns, burn location and burn causes.
Analysis of mortality predictors in a model adjusted by age and sex showed that old age (p<0.0001), inhalational injuries (p<0.0001) and burn percentage (P<0.0001) were the three mortality predictors in the multiple logistic regression model.
The relationship between early grafting and decreased mortality and increased LA50 was nearly significant in statistical analyses.
Burn patient survival rate and annual LA50 had an increasing trend in this hospital.
Early grafting surgery seemed to be effective on this trend and decreased mortality risk to a large extent.


Abstract
Compartment syndrome is a serious complication of high voltage electrical burns, limb carbonization and deep circular burns with delayed escharotomy.
Treatment is emergency surgical decompression.
We used it to measure pressure in muscular compartments.
In patients with thermal burns, we measured pressure before and after escharotomy.
Threshold intracompartmental pressure was 35 mmHg.
We carried out pressure assessment of all muscular compartments during and at the end of surgery.
The pressure transducer provides a pressure value in all muscular compartments with a time of installation and measuring of less than 5 minutes.
Operation is simple, non-operator dependent, and accessible to medical and paramedic teams.


Abstract
The objective was to critically review the data and assess the implications of NexoBrid [NexoBrid-NXB formerly Debrase Gel Dressing-DGD]a in the special field of deep hand burns.
These results were compared to a large cohort of patients treated with NXB in a previous, single arm study.
Thirty-one burned hands were treated with NXB and 41 hand burns were in the SOC group.
Mean percentage of burn wound area excised in the NXB group was 4.4 ± 13.1% compared to 52.0 ± 41.4% in the SOC group (p<0.0001).
None of the NXB-treated hands required escharotomy compared to 4 out of the 41 (9.7%) in the SOC group.
NXB enzymatic debridement demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in burn wound excision and auto-grafting compared to SOC, and seems to prevent the need for emergency escharotomy. a DGD is produced by MediWound and distributed under the name NexoBrid®.


Abstract
A one-year prospective study of burn patients presenting to the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos from June 1, 2007 to May 31, 2008 was conducted to evaluate the socioeconomic impact of burn injuries sustained by the patients.
There were 27 males and 25 females giving a M:F ratio of 1.1:1.
Social interactions were normal in 74.5% of the patients and none reported a poor quality of life.
The study showed a significant socioeconomic burden from burns.
It highlighted the importance of the informal sociocultural support system and the need for formal, well-structured social support systems.


Abstract
66.3% of MBI were work-related accidents.
Average burn surface area was 31% total body surface area (TBSA) and average full thickness area was 12% TBSA.

Fasting, intermittent or continuous, religious or therapeutic, is knowing a growing craze.
Good quality studies are needed to better understand the effects of fasting on health and diseases.


Abstract
The prevalence of patients with type 2 diabetes who are hospitalized is constantly increasing.
A minority of facilities have standardized hospital protocols for the diabetic patient regarding medication and continuity of care.
This article offers practical tools to optimize the transition of diabetic patients because they are more at risk of readmission and adverse events.
Establishing a structured and personalized discharge plan can help anticipate the hospital discharge and approach, in a more standardized way the different stages of an optimized transition.
Thus, a patient-centered approach including treatment adaptation, early anticipation of needs at discharge, transmission of essential points of therapeutic education and organization of outpatient monitoring, could improve glycemic control and reduce the number of readmissions or emergency consultations.


Abstract
Physical activity is recommended for all patients with diabetes, but it is important to be particularly attentive in patients with type 1 diabetes.
Because of their treatment, these patients have a higher risk of hypoglycemia.
The challenge for both caregivers and the patient is to find the best possible strategy to practice the desired physical activity without any significant hypo- or hyperglycemia.
Thus, an adaptation of the insulin and/or nutritional treatment is necessary, depending on the type, intensity and duration of the physical activity.
Allover, an interdisciplinary approach is highly recommended, both for a specific or a regular physical activity practice.

The prescriptor has to be an endocrinologist.


Abstract
According to the WHO classification (2012), the spindle cell carcinoma of the breast figures among variants of metaplastic carcinomas.
The average age at diagnosis is 53 years, and the usual course is fast.
The differential diagnosis arises with sarcomas, especially phyllodes sarcomas but also with other primary breast sarcomas which remain rare.
The distinction of this entity is important for further management of patients which is similar to that of conventional infiltrating carcinoma.


Abstract
Omphalitis is a rare infection in our countries.
Streptoccus pyogenes is one of the most frequently encountered germs.
Complications are rare but include septicemia and necrotizing fasciitis with a high mortality rate.
The case reported in this article is that of an 11 days old infant with pyogenic streptococcal omphalitis who developed cellulitis of left food.
An intravenous antibiotic treatment allowed complete resolution of the symptoms.
The article is the opportunity to review of the risk factors of this affection, its complications and treatments.


Abstract
We present the case of a 54 year old male complaining of abdominal pain localised in the right flank and irradiating in other abdominal regions.
The pain was previously associated with kidney stones, but persisted months after their total evacuation.
Suffering from Crohn's disease, low dose corticosteroids likely caused a particularly invalidating chronic prostatitis, which antibiotic treatment aggravated the symptoms of Crohn's disease, therefore complicating the therapeutic care by causing a vicious circle.
Further epidemiological and microbiological studies are needed in order to establish an association between low dose steroid for Crohn's disease and chronic pelvic pain syndrome.


Abstract
SAMHD1 is one of seven known genes responsible for Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.
It has the particularity to associate to this rare pediatric encephalopathy with autoimmune manifestations, a cerebral vasculopathy type Moyamoya.
This condition has only been recently reported, less than fifty times in the literature.
Our clinical case is a 11 year old boy from an inbred union whose clinical diagnosis confirmed genetically and followed by a review of current data determined an ad hoc management, presently described.
He underwent indirect neurosurgical revascularization by a multiple burr hole technique.
Through this clinical case, we tried taking stock of what we know -clinical, physiopathological and therapeutical aspects- given the rarity of this disease, first on the syndrome as such, then on the peculiarities of the gene mutations of interest.


Abstract
Cresols are phenol derivatives commonly used as surface disinfectants.
Ingestion may cause local mucocutaneous damage and extensive systemic toxicity : central nervous, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, renal and pulmonary.
We describe the case of a 33-year-old woman who swallowed, without suicidal intent, 50 to 70 cm3 of a 50% cresol solution.
Coma occurred within 5 minutes of ingestion, she presented a bradypnea with desaturation, and the SMUR team performed on-site an orotracheal intubation.
On arrival at the hospital, the patient had typical caustic lesions around her mouth.
Immediate management consisted of ventilatory support, instillation of activated charcoal by nasogastric tube, empirical intravenous methylene blue and effective vascular filling.
Within one hour of admission, she developed hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, and acute renal failure.
Toxic hepatitis occurred within 24 hours.
The 24-hour gastroscopy showed erosive esophagitis and erythematous gastropathy and duodenopathy.
No urine or blood dosage can be performed.
The patient left the hospital on the fifth day and her liver function normalized after one month.
The treatment of phenol poisoning consists primarily of rapid decontamination and the support of vital functions.
Diagnostic assays are not available routinely and anamnesis, as well as some semiological cardinal points, is essential.


Abstract
We report a rare case of a 33 year-old man victim of a public assault resulting in bilateral enucleation of the orbits.
Meaning castration, such an act may express a psychiatric or a neurologic disorder.


Abstract
The false aneurysm of the left ventricle is a rare complication after a mitral valvular surgery.
It results from the rupture of the ventricular wall inside an adhering pericardium, thus constituting a cavity whose wall is devoid of myocardial elements and communicates with the ventricle by a large collar.
Its clinical presentation remains not very specific with an insidious spontaneous evolution which is generally done towards rupture with sudden death by tamponade.
Various sophisticated modern diagnostic techniques allows a precise diagnosis.
The letal nature of this lesion must be recognized and justifies an immediate surgical repair.
We report the case of a 68 years old patient who presented herself in consultation of cardiology with a NYHA IIb (New York Heart Association) cardiac failure 4 months after a surgery of mitral valvular replacement.
The transthoracic echography showed a voluminous false aneurysm of the left ventricle confirmed by cardiac CT scan.
She has benefited from an anevrismectomy with good clinic evolution.
This observation illustrates the late and silent character of the development of the false aneurysm of the left ventricle after mitral valvular surgery.

Intestinal bacterial diversity and richness are altered in malnourished people compared to healthy people.
The first studies on the modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics, prebiotics, symbiotics, fecal transplantation and antibiotics for weight gain are encouraging.


Abstract
Seminal plasma is a complex fluid comprised of secretions from the seminal vesicles, the prostate, bulbourethral glands and from the seminiferous tubule lumen / epididymides / vasa deferentia.
Finally, this review has focused on the association between semen and sperm functional quality and the seminal plasma proteome, in order to demonstrate cellular and molecular mechanisms of male infertility.
Due to the untargeted nature of the majority of the studies presented in this review, and to the diverse range of techniques utilized to study the seminal plasma proteomic composition, many differentially expressed proteins were observed.
Moreover, it seems there is an inflammatory component to the seminal plasma of infertile men.
In conclusion, there are a number of studies focused on the proteomic composition of human seminal plasma; downstream confirmatory studies will help to understand specific pathways of infertility in different biological conditions.


Abstract
Kt/V is a nondimensional number and a scaling parameter that has, with arbitrary definitions, been recast as a measure of dialysis by Gotch and Lysaght.
This editorial discusses the concept of nondimensional numbers within the context of dialysis measurement, modeling, and medical evidence.


Abstract
Kidney disease has been described as the most neglected chronic disease.
A range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases result in renal complications and many people who have kidney disease lack access to care.
The causes, consequences and costs of kidney diseases have implications for public health policy in all countries.
The risks of kidney disease are also influenced by ethnicity, gender, location and lifestyle.
Increasing economic and health disparities, migration, demographic transition, unsafe working conditions and environmental threats, natural disasters and pollution may thwart attempts to reduce the morbidity and mortality from kidney disease.
A multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease.
The sustainable development goals (SDGs) emphasize the importance of a multisectoral approach to health.
We map the actions towards achieving all of the SDGs that have the potential to improve understanding, measurement, prevention and treatment of kidney disease in all age groups.
These actions can also foster treatment innovations and reduce the burden of such disease in future generations.


Abstract
Diarrhea in calves is one of the most important cattle diseases in Switzerland.
The diagnosis and treatment of calf diarrhea represent a major challenge.
Cryptosporidium parvum has been described as a cause of diarrhea in one to three weeks old calves since the 1970s.
Oral ingestion of persistent environmental oocysts results in severe diarrhea lasting four to six days and shedding of large numbers of infectious oocysts.
Detailed knowledge about the epidemiology and virulence of the different C. parvum strains is still lacking.
In addition, current diagnostic tests cannot reliably distinguish between non-pathogenic (e.g. C. bovis) and pathogenic Cryptosporidium species.
Until now, no effective therapeutic drug or vaccine against calf cryptosporidiosis has been found.
Water-borne epidemics and the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium in immunodeficient patients are of great medical importance.
The increasing number of cryptosporidiosis cases associated with high infant mortality in less industrialized and impoverished regions (including South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) has intensified the research in recent years.
The recent discoveries of new therapeutics against C. parvum may benefit calf medicine in the near future.
This review article reports on these new developments, highlights calf cryptosporidiosis in Switzerland and draws attention to a new research project.


Abstract
Post-mortem diagnostics are an important tool for disease diagnosis and therefore early detection of (re-)emerging animal diseases and zoonoses as well as nationwide disease surveillance programs.
To counteract the decline of porcine necropsies in Switzerland over the last ten years, the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) launched a national project in 2014 called PathoPig.
Post-mortem examinations of pigs from herds with health problems were financially supported by the FSVO.
During the first 3 years of the project, the number of pig necropsies increased by 195% (mean).
An underlying cause of disease was identified in 74% of the cases.
These findings resulted in specific recommendations by the attending veterinarians or by the Swiss Porcine Health Service.
A follow-up survey revealed that herd health had improved in 90% of the farms implementing the recommendations.


Abstract
Piscine mycobacteriosis is a lethal disease with zoonotic potential, found worldwide in both fresh and marine fish.
More than 20 strains of Mycobacterium spp. are known to persist in fish so far, but the pathogenicity is currently unknown for most of them.
However, M. marinum is reported as one of the most pathogenic agents for fish and is involved in zoonotic cases.
We examined 47 different cases from two zoological gardens, where fish tuberculosis was identified or previously suspected during the last ten years.
We collected PCR and sequencing data, which were then compared to previously collected clinical data and pathology.
The clinical signs caused by Mycobacterium spp. were similar in all the cases, except for cases infected by M. marinum, which lacked the presence of skin lesions.
Lesions seen in histology caused by M. marinum tended to be more acute and severe compared lesions caused by other Mycobacterium spp.
The majority of M. marinum cases have been reported within marine fish.
In contrast to previous studies we detected this species to be the predominant bacteria present within freshwater fish.
Interestingly, we detected M. holsaticum in one of the seawater systems used in this project, being the first report of this Mycobacterium species shown to be present in a fish.


Abstract
The rise in opioid-related harms is an issue of increasing public health importance in Canada.
These findings highlight the importance of pan- Canadian surveillance of opioid-related harms, as well as the need for evidence-based policies to help reduce these harms.


Abstract
The Government of Manitoba launched the provincial Take-Home Naloxone Program in January 2017.
Most of these events occurred among males (60.2%) and in a private residence (72.0%).
Fentanyl and carfentanil were the most common substances reported during overdose events.
Take-Home Naloxone Program data provide important information about the unique context of the opioid crisis in Manitoba.

Abstract
The CS child, aged 9, is evacuated from a health center located 200km away from Ouagadougou (capital of BF) for decompensated heart failure.
Clinically we noted a syndrome of congestive heart failure.
No obvious cause has been found outside of the advancing age of parents (50 years) and the potential risks of rubella infection.
A Doppler echocardiography revealed a fistula aorto-pulmonary 17mm wide associated with a pericardial effusion of average circumferential abundance and a dilation of the left ventricular.
Pulmonary radiography showed a large cardiomegaly and left pleurisy.
The discovery of congenital heart disease between 2 and 4 years is very rare but the prognosis is good with surgical treatment.


Abstract
CA, 14 old years, female, born last uterine siblings of 9 children, 4 died of various causes, was admitted in the pediatric service of CHU-YO for functional impairment of the lower limbs.
Physical examination revealed swelling and deformation harsh, uneven surfaces, the circumferential upper and lower limbs and lumbar spine associated with spastic paraplegia.
Sphincter disturbances accompany this clinical picture.
The radiographic bone marrow hypertrophy individually with images of exostosis at the epiphyses.
Multiple exostosis or BESSEF Hogen's disease is rare and has a reserve functional prognosis because of outcome of low spinal cord compression and vascular compression.
We felt it appropriate to bring this case discovered during our clinical practice because of its rarity and the risk of malignant degeneration.


Abstract
Statins are generally well tolerated molecules.
We report a case of a 70-year-old woman with high blood pressure who was treating hypercholesterolemia by atorvastatin.
Two weeks after beginning this new treatment, the patient developed muscular weakness in all four limbs with myalgias; and a purpura in the upper limbs and abdomen.
This suggests that the medical anomalies found in the patient were drug-induced.
The literature confirms the rarity of this association.
The severity of some side effects of statins should remain in the minds of medicine prescribers.


Abstract
Cardiovascular disease still represents, together with cancer, a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
Atherosclerosis is a silent progressive process, which can start in early life and usually progresses with advancing age.
Besides genetic predisposition, atherosclerosis is accelerated by the presence of several modifiable risk factors such as smoking, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
Asymptomatic atherosclerosis may lead to an acute event, mostly due to plaque rupture and secondary thrombosis.
If the thrombus is occlusive, according to the artery where it occurs, the acute complication involves most often an acute coronary event or an ischaemic stroke.
Major cardiovascular events (MACEs) represent the primary outcome in a majority of clinical trials.
Some populations, as patients with type 2 diabetes, are especially prone to these complications due to atherothrombosis linked to subclinical accelerated atherosclerosis.
In most cases, an emergency intervention is mandatory to avoid premature death or irreversible sequelae.


Abstract
To cope with overcrowding, a consequence of their constant growth, emergency departments have implemented operational strategies based on triage systems.
Among those, advanced nurse triage, allowing a nurse to initiate the diagnostic process just after categorization of the patient, seems to be promising.
A study on advanced nurse triage for patients presenting with chest pain has been conducted in the emergency department of the CHU of Liège.

Acute coronary syndromes represent a major cause of mortality in our country.


Abstract
Acute heart failure is a common cause of admission in emergency department.
Management requires rapid support when haemodynamic or respiratory parameters are altered.
Identifying enabling factors and their specific treatment is an integral part of management.
The most common clinical presentation is volume overload, whose treatment remains the combination of diuretics and vasodilators.
In case of impaired perfusion, various inotropic supports may be considered, but also more and more circulatory assistance devices.


Abstract
Cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of admission in the emergency department.


Abstract
Myocarditis is an illness characterized by myocardial infiltration with inflammatory cells and non-ischemic myocytic necrosis.
The clinical presentation of myocarditis varies widely and diagnosis is sometimes difficult to establish.
Treatment is generally symptomatic, but in some cases, a specific therapy is appropriated as a function of the corresponding aetiology.
This paper aims to review current knowledge concerning myocarditis, with particular emphasis on «urgent» situations.


Abstract
Cardiac tamponade is a vital emergency.
It occurs when the accumulation of intra-pericardial fluid exceeds the pericardial adaptation capacity.
Pericardial pressure is equalized with that of cardiac cavities and severe heart failure occurs, most often rapidly.
Several clinical presentations are possible.
The diagnosis is based on the assessment of pericardial effusion and its impact on the heart by echocardiography.
Supportive treatments have limited effectiveness.
The only emergency treatment is drainage of the pericardium by direct puncture or by surgical approach.


Abstract
Infective endocarditis is a rare disease that can lead to some diagnostic wandering because of its often nonspecific and polymorphic clinical manifestations.
This latency is at the origin of severe cardiac and extra-cardiac complications, yet highly fatal.


Abstract
[Aortic dissection].
Among the risk factors, age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and genetic disorders of the connective tissue have been identified.
A prompt diagnosis and an adequate treatment are important in the management of affected patients.
The type of treatment depends on the location and extension of the dissection.
Open surgical repair is most commonly used for dissections involving the ascending aorta and the aortic arch, whereas endovascular intervention is indicated for descending aorta dissections that are complicated.


Abstract
Ruptured abdominal aorta is a cardiovascular emergency with an overall mortality rate of up to 70% at 30 days.

Abstract
In this study, we report the results of the experience of the Rheumatology Department of Cocody University Hospital in the management of the cervical spinal tuberculosis in Abidjan area.
This was a retrospective study of 26 cases collected over a 7 year period (January 2006 to December 2013).
The objective of this work was to illustrate the epidemiological, clinical and radiological profile of the cervical localization of tuberculosis in our practice.
The prevalence of cervical disease was 4.87%.
The average age of our patients was 48.27 years, with a slight male predominance (60.7%).
The duration of disease progression was long (8 months on average); symptomatology was dominated by pain associated with stiffness in all patients (100%).
One third of patients had already consulted at the stage of neurological complications (1 case of Brown Sequard syndrome, 2 cases of tetraparesis, 5 cases of paraplegia).
Computer tomography was performed in all patients, followed by an MRI scan for 6 patients, which revealed the predominance of damage to the C3-C4 floor (34.62%) and 3 cases of sub occipital localization.
Spondylodiscitis was the main radiological anatomical lesion (88.46%), lesions were multi-stage in 61.54% of cases, the prevalence of retropharyngeal abscess was high (84.61% of cases), that of the epiduritis was 76.92% and radiological spinal cord compression was recorded in a third of cases.
All patients benefited from an antituberculous treatment associated with cervical immobilization.


Abstract
The importance of nursing work is well established in the treatment of patients.
But the weakness of the nurse-patient ratio and lack of proper equipment create a workload for these nurses and can impact on the quality of care.
The objective of this study was to assess the nursing workload during night shifts in a hospital in Benin.
A prospective observational study of the work of nurses in the general medical service of this hospital was conducted.
A comprehensive and systematic analysis of this work was done and resulted in the identification of the tasks performed, the analysis of postures and the evaluation of the average distance walked by nurses.
Performing care tasks occupy more than one third of the working time and approximately 3 minutes were spent per tasks.
The improvement of the work conditions will decrease the workload and will contribute to better care for patients.


Abstract
Nine years after the creation of the unit, it becomes important to evaluate the degree of community participation of the elderly within that unit.
This is a qualitative, descriptive and analytic study that took place from 9 October to 23 October, 2010.
The two methods used to collect the data are interviewing and focus group.
Recommendations have been stated for the CAAPA unit to fully play its role.


Abstract
Numerous studies have shown the influence of some bacteria colonizing the breeding sites on the development of the parasite in Anopheles malaria vectors.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the breeding sites of Plasmodium falciparum on the gametocytes infectivity of Anopheles gambiae sl using the membrane feeding method.
We carried out an experimental infestation study from September 2010 to January 2011 in a village located in the southern savanna of Mali.
Cross sectional surveys were conducted to collect larvae and to select gametocyte carriers.
Female offspring of L3 and L4 stage larvae were used for the experimental infestation.
The gametocyte carriers were children aged within 4 to 12 years.
Bacteria identified in breeding water of larvae and adult mosquitoes were: Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas spp, Staphylococcus spp, Shigella sp.
The oocyst load of infected mosquitoes did not significantly vary according to the samples (F = 1.517, P = 0.230).
Low infection rates (5.4% and 2.8%) were observed in the larval bedding and in mosquitoes containing K. oxytoca and Shigella.


Abstract
In order to study the complications of artificial depigmentation (AD) in Mauritania, we conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among women in the Dermatology Department of Nouakchott national hospital from July to September 2012.
The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of complications of AD.
Of the 394 patients who consulted during the study period, we identified 164 users of depigmentation products.
The average age of users of AD is 30.38 years, ranging from 13 to 70 years.
The levels of study are most represented 40.2% in the primary and secondary in 41.5%.
56% of patients were married, 24% were single.
52% of married patients say their spouses disapprove of this practice.
49.4% of patients are undergo artificial depigmentation to be beautiful.
96.3% of these users had one or more complications.
The women's main motivation is aesthetic (49.4%).
Among users, 73.8% know the side effects without this discouraging this practice.
Most often these side effects do not motivate a consultation and are well tolerated by patients who accept them as ransom AD.
Despite the high prevalence of light-skinned subjects, in Mauritania artificial depigmentation remains a common practice.


Abstract
Tuberculoma of the cerebellum is a rare presentation of human tuberculosis and the presence of this disease in central nervous system in particular.
The diagnosis was possible with MRI that revealed a mass in the cerebellar tonsil, not taking the contrast after gadolinium injection.
The evolution under treatment for tuberculosis was positive.
The control MRI performed at 15 months showed no more damage.


Abstract
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the second cause of admission in the emergency department at the Nianankoro Fomba hospital of Ségou.
Young adults with low income are the most affected.
We conducted a prospective study from September 2009 to December 2010 at the Nianankoro Fomba hospital of Ségou.
All patients admitted in the emergency ward for TBI for more than 24 hours were included.
The total cost of services was 7,269,320 CFA.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the clinical outcomes of surgery of obstetric urogenital genital fistula.
This was a cross sectional study, which focused on factors influencing results in the treatment of urogenital fistula, from January 2011 to January 2012 at the urology department of the Point-G University Hospital.
This study involved 115 patients suffering from urogenital fistula.
Cure of urogenital fistula accounted for 17% of the bloc's activities.
Closure of the fistula was achieved in 68.7% of cases.
This result was influenced by certain factors.
Fistulas operated primarily peri-sinus tissue remodeling were closed in 71.42% of cases.
Factors related to the patient and care: those carried out for the first time have a success rate of 68.42%, only 47.62% of success in patients who presented after five years.
Factors related to clinicopathological seat: fistula vesicovaginal septum and cervical-vaginal urethrovaginal reported a success rate of 76.92%.
Care-related factors include: the experience of the surgeon, surgeons of the urology service have a 76.19% success rate against 25% from other surgeons.
The incision fistula was related to the clinicopathological seat, so the trigonal-vaginal fistulas and uretero addressed by the upper route have been successful in 85%.
In addition to these factors the postoperative follow-up, the instruments, the suture thread, the operating table, and the lighting in the room have also improved the results.


Abstract
Mandibular location is barely described in the literature; it mainly affects adults in their thirties.
We report the case of a 43 years old man with a painful right cheek mass evolving 7 years after the end of treatment for undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Mandibular bone osteosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor in Morocco.


Abstract
The aim is to provide to the general practitioner an update and simple tools for the current management.


Abstract
For intermediate-risk patients, we recommend initial cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram, followed if necessary by postoperative ERCP.


Abstract
An appendix tumour is found every 100 appendectomies.
It can also be incidental discovery during a routine radiological examination and presents as a mucocele of the appendix.
Appendix tumours are of varied histological type, and include mainly neuroendocrine tumours as well as epithelial tumours.
The latter, when they secrete mucin, can give rise to peritoneal pseudomyxoma, a particular form of carcinosis harbouring serious complications.
The management of appendix tumours responds to specific recommendations and, in advanced cases, requires the expertise of a university centre specialized in digestive oncology.
The role of the primary care practitioner lies in the diagnosis and referral of patients with appendix tumours.

The purpose of this article is to remain the specificities of these two populations and to propose recommendations for the good use of opioids for ambulatory care.


Abstract
Osteoarthritis is one of the principal reasons for chronic pain worldwide.
With the increase of life span, sedentary lifestyle and obesity, its socioeconomic impact is on the rise.
The origin of osteoarthritis pain is heterogeneous and related to structural changes of all intra-and para-articular components.
Optimization of biomechanics constitutes a principal pillar of therapeutic strategies.
Identification of a neuropathic component of pain is important to implement the optimal pharmacotherapy.


Abstract
Capgras delusion is classified with the misidentification syndromes.
In dementia it associates cognitive deficiency of memory and facial recognition (prosopoagnosia) with delirious idea of substitution by a double.
We discuss data from the literature concerning prevalence, results of cerebral imaging and functional prognosis associated with this curious syndrome.


Abstract
This paper deals with the history of the relationship between the mind-body dualism and the epistemology of madness.
The epistemology of the neurosciences bypasses the conundrum, as it processes all together the variables representing the brain, subjectivity, and behavior and bridges the "philosophical" gap by means of correlational structures.


Abstract
Medical progress, the improvement of general living conditions, and an increase in life expectancy have led to an increase in the general prevalence of oncologic disease.
More importantly, more and more patients survive cancer or live with the disease for long periods of time.
While the battle for survivorship is continuously being fought, improving patients' quality of life has come to the fore.
Psychosocial issues may modulate the course of the disease, but mainly have a deep impact on patients' physical and mental wellbeing.
Psycho-oncology has risen as a relatively new interdisciplinary field with the aim of addressing these issues and providing support for patients confronting numerous challenges throughout the different stages of the disease.
In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of body-mind interactions in cancer and an outline of the broad spectrum of psycho-oncologic care, with a special focus on the treatment of pain, fatigue, sexual issues, and fear of progression.


Abstract
Decades of research has revealed several, and sometimes surprising, links between CHD and mental illness, and has even suggested that both may actually cause one another.
However, the precise nature of these links has not yet been clearly established.


Abstract
The relationship between stress and infertility has been debated for years.
What is less clear, however, is whether or not stress causes infertility.
The impact of distress on treatment outcome is difficult to investigate for a number of factors, including inaccurate self-report measures and feelings of increased optimism at treatment onset.
A cognitive-behavioral group approach may be the most efficient way to achieve both goals.
Given the distress levels reported by many infertile women, it is vital to expand the availability of these programs.


Abstract
The comorbidity of mental and physical disorders is a major challenge for health care worldwide.
Its prevalence is increasing and is likely to continue to grow due to the increase in life expectancy and a variety of other reasons.
The comorbidity of depression and diabetes can be seen as a prototypical example of mental/physical comorbidity.


Abstract
Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, physical exhaustion, and cognitive difficulties.
It occurs in all populations throughout the world, with prevalence between 2% and 4% in general populations.
The various classification systems according to pain medicine, psychiatry, and neurology (pain disease; persistent somatoform pain disorder; masked depression; somatic symptom disorder; small fiber neuropathy; brain disease) mostly capture only some components of this complex and heterogeneous disorder.
The diagnosis can be established in most cases by a general practitioner when the symptoms meet recognized criteria and a somatic disease sufficiently explaining the symptoms is excluded.
Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines give a strong recommendation for aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioral therapies.
Drug therapy is not mandatory.
Only a minority of patients experience substantial symptom relief with duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin.


Abstract
Psychiatric patients have a greater risk of premature mortality, predominantly due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
Convincing evidence shows that psychiatric conditions are characterized by an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.
This increased risk is present for a range of psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
There is some evidence for a dose-response association with the severity and duration of symptoms and for a bidirectional longitudinal impact between psychiatric disorders and MetS.
Associations generally seem stronger with abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia dysregulations than with hypertension.
Contributing mechanisms are an unhealthy lifestyle and a poor adherence to medical regimen, which are prevalent among psychiatric patients.
Specific psychotropic medications have also shown a profound impact in increasing MetS dysregulations.
Finally, pleiotropy in genetic vulnerability and pathophysiological mechanisms, such as those leading to the increased central and peripheral activation of immunometabolic or endocrine systems, plays a role in both MetS and psychiatric disorder development.
The excess risk of MetS and its unfavorable somatic health consequences justifies a high priority for future research, prevention, close monitoring, and treatment to reduce MetS in the vulnerable psychiatric patient.


Abstract
This manuscript summarizes the literature on mental health outcomes after cardiac arrest.
Survivors of cardiac arrest show high rates of mental illness with more than 40% suffering from anxiety, 30% from depression, and 25% from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Mental health outcomes may differ depending on the setting in which the cardiac arrest occurred.
A major problem is reduced neuropsychological functioning.
Between 30% and 50% of survivors of cardiac arrest suffer from cognitive deficits.
Deficits of attention, declarative memory, executive function, visual-spatial abilities, and verbal fluency have been observed.
As a result of numerous psychopathological symptoms (depression in 14% to 45%, anxiety in 13% to 61%, and PTSD in 19% to 27%) and reduced cognitive functioning (about 20% to 60%), relevantly reduced quality of life is observed in about 20% of cardiac arrest survivors.


Abstract
The nuclear lamina (NL) is a filamentous protein meshwork, composed essentially of lamins, situated between the inner nuclear membrane and the chromatin.
The NL is a component of the nuclear envelope, interacts with a wide range of proteins and is required for normal nuclear structure and physiological development.
During spermiogenesis the spermatid nucleus is elongated, and dramatically reduced in size with protamines replacing histones to produce a highly compacted chromatin.
There is mounting evidence from studies in human and rodent, that the NL plays an important role in mammalian spermatid differentiation during spermiogenesis.
In this review, we summarize and discuss the data available in the literature regarding the involvement of lamins and their direct or indirect partners in normal and abnormal human spermiogenesis.


Abstract
Good quality, timely data are the cornerstone of health systems, but in many countries these data are not used for evidence-informed decision making and/or for improving public health.
Policies adopted from evidence-based information generated through the SORT IT and D2P approaches can be evaluated to assess their impact, and the cycle repeated to identify and resolve new public health problems.
Ministries of Health could benefit from this twin-training approach to make themselves 'data rich, information rich and action rich', and thereby use routinely collected data in a synergistic manner to improve public health policy making and health care delivery.


Abstract
Smoking is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality, particularly among patients with tuberculosis (TB).
Although smoking cessation is recommended by the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, there has been no published evaluation of smoking cessation interventions among people with TB.
The purpose of this review was to synthesize the evidence on interventions and suggest practice, research and policy implications.


Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of childhood mortality.
Isoniazid preventive therapy significantly reduces progression to TB disease.
The World Health Organization recommends that high TB burden countries conduct child contact management (CCM) to identify exposed child contacts aged <5 years for screening and appropriate treatment.
An active, clinic-based CCM strategy incorporating transport/screening reimbursement, monitoring and evaluation tools, and health care worker education was implemented in western Kenya.
Among 169 identified child contacts aged <5 years, 146 (86%) underwent successful screening, of whom 43 (29%) were diagnosed with active TB.
We describe our CCM strategy and its potential for enhancing screening and treatment efforts.

In primary care, there is no universally agreed approach to classifying the severity of harm arising from such patient-safety incidents.
This lack of an agreed approach limits learning that could lead to the prevention of injury to patients.
In a review of research on patient safety in primary care, we identified 21 existing approaches to the classification of harm severity.
Using the World Health Organization's (WHO's) International Classification for Patient Safety as a reference, we undertook a framework analysis of these approaches.
We then developed a new system for the classification of harm severity.
To assess and classify harm, most existing approaches use measures of symptom duration (11/21), symptom severity (11/21) and/or the level of intervention required to manage the harm (14/21).
However, few of these approaches account for the deleterious effects of hospitalization or the psychological stress that may be experienced by patients and/or their relatives.
The new classification system we developed builds on WHO's International Classification for Patient Safety and takes account not only of hospitalization and psychological stress but also of so-called near misses and uncertain outcomes.
The constructs we have outlined have the potential to be applied internationally, across primary-care settings, to improve both the detection and prevention of incidents that cause the most severe harm to patients.


Abstract
In 2015, the Chinese government raised tobacco excise tax for the first time since 2009.
Between 2014 and 2016, the retail price of cigarettes increased on average by 11%, with the cheapest category of cigarette brands increasing by 20%.
The average proportion of tax in the price of cigarettes rose from 51.7% to 55.7%.
Annual cigarette sales decreased by 7.8%, from 127 to 117 billion packs.
The increase in cigarette prices could be associated with a 0.2% to 0.6% decrease in the proportion of adults smoking, representing between 2.2 and 6.5 million fewer smokers.
The 2015 tax increase shows that tobacco taxation can provide measurable benefits to both public health and finance in China.
The experience also highlights the potential for tobacco taxation to contribute to China's broader development targets, including the sustainable development goals and Healthy China 2030.
Looking forward, this link to development can be facilitated through multisectoral research and dialogue to develop consistent cross-sectoral objectives for tobacco tax policy design and implementation.


Abstract
Primary retroperitoneal carcinosarcoma or mixed malignant mullerian tumor (MMMT) is an extremely rare clinical entity.
The retroperitoneal location is exceptional.
She received adjuvant chemotherapy with 6 cycles of Carboplatin and Paclitaxel.
She is in complete clinical and radiological remission since the end of chemotherapy, for a total of 113 months.
This case and the review of the literature illustrate the importance of surgical treatment.
However, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the systemic management of these tumors.

Abstract
Twiddler syndrome is an exceptional cause of dysfunction of cardiac prostheses resulting from a displacement of the probe either by deliberate or unconscious manipulation.
The patient has benefited from extraction with reimplantation of a new defibrillation probe.
The originality of this observation is underlined by the occurrence of a previously unrecognized inaugural syncopal atrioventricular block revealing Twiddler syndrome in a patient initially implanted with a secondary prevention defibrillator for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.


Abstract
We report 2 clinical cases of patients who presented hemorrhages.


Abstract
Occupational lumbar back accidents in the private sector: prevalence and factors associated with their severity and sequelae in central Tunisia.
In Tunisia, few studies have been focused on occupational lumbar back accidents.
Data were collected from the regional centre of the National Health Insurance Fund of Sousse.
We identified 293 cases, a prevalence of 14.2% in relation to all occupational accidents reported during this period.
More than two thirds of the injured (69.2%) were victims of serious occupational lumbar back accidents and 33.8% of victims reported serious sequelae.
After adjustment by binary logistic regression, the occupational category persisted as an associated factor with the severity of occupational lumbar back accidents (P = 0.001, OR = 2.86 [1.50-5.47]).
Surgical treatment appeared as an associated factor of severity (P < 0.001, OR = 9.06 [3.09-26.56]) and prominent after effects resulting from these accidents (P < 0.001 OR = 54.72 [18.84-158.93]).
Occupational lumbar back accidents are a real health problem.
Thus, a preventive strategy should be implemented to reduce their socio-economic consequences.


Abstract
There were 85 (57.4%) boys and 63 (42.6%) girls.
Almost all of the injuries (144, 98%) occurred at home.
Other sources were kerosene explosion (7, 4.7%), burning firewood (1, 0.6%) petrol explosion (5, 3.4%), candlelight (3, 2.0%), hot ashes (1, 0.6%), soot (1, 0.6%), burned house, chemicals and friction (1, 0.6%).


Abstract
The mean total body surface area burned was 8.4 ± 8.3%.


Abstract
Vinorelbine is an anticancer agent with high clinical efficacy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare but serious cutaneous adverse reaction associated with drug therapy.
We hereby present a case report of a patient with metastatic breast cancer, treated with vinorelbine, who developed toxic epidermal necrolysis.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the second case report describing this exceptional dermatologic emergency associated with vinorelbine.
In June 2014, a 33-year-old female was treated for localized breast cancer.
In December 2016, a brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebral and cerebellar recurrence of the breast cancer.
Whole brain radiation therapy was administered and treatment with vinorelbine was subsequently initiated.
On day 3 of the first cycle of chemotherapy, she presented a general malaise and an itchy rash with conjunctivitis, oral ulcers and diffuse alopecia.
The clinical diagnosis was toxic epidermal necrolysis due to vinorelbine.
The patient was transferred to the burn unit.
She subsequently developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and died of multi-organ failure.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis is an extremely rare, acute hypersensitivity reaction involving the skin and mucous membranes.
Features more suggestive of toxic epidermal necrolysis are acute onset and rapid worsening of painful lesions of the skin and mucous membranes.
Specific treatment with active interventions should be practiced in the context of an international and multicentre clinical study in order to give sufficient power for such trials in this rare disease.


Abstract
The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse specific aspects of electrical injuries and to delineate a prevention strategy.
97% of these patients were male.
The mean age was 38.3±13.7years and mean TBSA was 11.9%±13.2%.
Injuries were classified as low-voltage burns (24.2%), highvoltage burns (30.3%) and flash burns (45.5%).
Although there was a higher incidence of amputations in this group (16.7% vs. 12.5%), the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.487).
The high prevalence of electrical burns in males and workers emphasizes the need to review occupational safety regulations.
Educational efforts regarding potential hazards of electricity and reinforcing compliance with safety measures are essential to avoid these injuri.


Abstract
Inhalation burn injury (IBI) is a risk factor for mortality in burn patients.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to analyze the incidence of hospital acquired infections (HAIs) in burn patients, and to determine the principle infection sites and the sensitivity profile of the microorganisms to antimicrobials.
This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted in a specialized centre for the treatment of burns from January 2009 to December 2013.
The sample consisted of 404 patients, divided into two groups: the first group comprised 142 patients without infection, and the second group was made up of 262 patients who had acquired HAIs.
There was a predominance of males in both groups.
Mean age of the patients without infection was 37 years (SD 14.89), and 38 years (SD 15.78) for the patients with HAIs.


Abstract
Modern warfare has seen advances in both weaponry and personnel protective material, thus allowing for better survival of injured individuals.
As a result, the medical system is faced with an increasing number and diversity of non-life threatening wounds, to the extremities especially, sustained by multiple mechanisms.
These wounds have a thermal injury component regardless of the mechanism, and there is often a delay in them being definitively treated, thus affecting final cosmetic and functional outcomes.
Fourteen patients presented to our institution after sustaining blast injuries of different etiologies.
Time of admission was between 0-10 days, and time of microvascular reconstruction after initial serial debridement was between 5-28 days.
All patients were found to be infected with multiple organisms upon admission.
Five patients were reconstructed with free vascularized skin flaps, three with osseous and osseocutaneous free flaps, four with free latissimus dorsi muscle flaps and two by toe-to-hand transfer.
The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 52 weeks (mean, 26.7 weeks).
Eleven free flaps survived completely.
Two patients presented with minor dehiscence and were treated with secondary closure.
Two patients developed a hematoma under the flap that required evacuation.
One flap failed due to arterial thrombosis.
Early free flap reconstruction proves to be a good option for the early reconstruction of blast injuries with thermal components after serial debridement and tangential excision of the wound beds.


Abstract
Soft tissue defects in the postero-inferior aspect of the leg are still challenging, especially when they affect the Achilles tendon due to its important functional involvement in the normal movement of the ankle.
Dorsiflexion and flexion may be affected if proper reconstruction is not achieved, thus limiting daily activities such as walking, climbing stairs or running.
Several techniques, including local or regional flaps, combinations of tendon substitutes with free muscular or fasciocutaneous flaps, and free composite flaps with tendon have been described for the reconstruction of complex defects caused by burn sequelae, tumors, trauma, chronic ulcers, etc.
The gold standard treatment for moderate to large defects is the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap with vascularized fascia lata.
The ALT flap is reliable because of a long vascular pedicle and a large donor area.
Moreover, the fascia lata mimics the Achilles tendon perfectly when rolled on itself.
The aim of this article is to present the application of this technique for the first time in a case of an acute burn.
The timing of reconstruction with free flaps is critical in acute burns.
In our case, it was performed on the 24th day post-burn and no microsurgical complications appeared.
More than six months after surgery, the patient showed a normal gait, was able to lift his own weight against gravity and no complications were detected in the donor area.


Abstract
Scarring after a burn injury remains the greatest unmet challenge in the treatment of functional and psychosocial sequelae of burns.
We present a case of upper and lower extremity partial-thickness burns in a female patient treated in two different modalities.
Deeper, lower extremity burns were debrided with a new bromelain-based debriding agent, resulting in scar-free healing.
The pathophysiology of hypertrophic scar formation is based on the perturbation of collagen production or degradation or both.
The duration and magnitude of the inflammatory phase of wound healing also appears to play a role in hypertrophic scarring.
Bromelain has demonstrated an anti-angiogenic effect in various cancer cell lines and it has been shown to regulate a variety of pro-angiogenic growth factors.
This case raises the classical question of the relationship between time to healing and formation of hypertrophic scars after burn injury, pointing to other potential factors that may play an important role in burn healing.


Abstract
This article provides an overview of the current knowledge on wild boar health in Switzerland and discusses the health risk to domestic animals and humans currently posed by wild boar.
The major threat coming from abroad originates from the expansion of African swine fever.
To prevent pathogen introduction and transmission between wild boar and domestic pigs, it is essential to pursue efforts in 4 areas: disease surveillance in domestic pigs, biosecurity on pig farms, disease surveillance in wild boar, and sustainable wild boar management.


Abstract
Heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial blood pressure and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded.
Anaesthesia quality was scored and postoperative behaviour assessed.
As butorphanol caused unacceptable side effects, its use was stopped.
Group M showed worse anaesthesia quality than ML4 and ML8 (higher incidence of movements: 11/17, 3/18 and 4/17, respectively).
Postoperative behaviour did not differ between groups.


Abstract
In case of insufficient analgesia, lidocaine 2% (0.25 ml) was injected intratesticular.
If two piglets showed an insufficient anaesthetic induction phase, depth of anaesthesia or recovery, the next dosage in the algorithm was tried.

Abstract
In the light of recurring anti-doping news, this article discusses some special cases and extends to the future prospects of developing effective anti-doping strategies.
After recalling the current principles of the fight against doping, the use of substances tole-rated at a certain threshold, and the therapeutic use exemptions (TUE) are discussed.
Authorized substances with a health risk for athletes are discussed before concluding on the development of the athlete's biological passport as a future common ground for anti-doping and medical follow-up of athletes.
In conclusion, this approach emphasizes the imperative dialogue between anti-doping organizations and sports medicine in order to defend good practices preserving the intrinsic value of sport.


Abstract

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of cannabidiol (CBD) in healthy dogs.
Serial cannabidiol plasma concentrations were measured over the first 12 h and repeated at 2, 4, and 6 wk.
Higher systemic exposures were observed with the oral CBD-infused oil formulation and the half-life after a 75-mg and 150-mg dose was 199.7 ± 55.9 and 127.5 ± 32.2 min, respectively.
Exposure is dose-proportional and the oral CBD-infused oil provides the most favorable pharmacokinetic profile.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to observe the outcomes of adding an antimicrobial treatment to a conventional treatment regime in horses with severe equine asthma in a clinical setting.

Abstract
At baseline, the TNR group was subjected to a TNR event.


Abstract
Clinically healthy pigs used in research are assumed to have normal cardiac structure and function.
Subclinical cardiac abnormalities may adversely affect the responses being measured in these experiments.
The gross and histologic lesions observed in hearts collected from a Canadian abattoir between 2012 and 2015 indicated an unexpectedly high prevalence of cardiac abnormalities: 75% (297/396) of the hearts examined had such lesions.
The ratios of total heart weight to body weight and of right ventricle weight to body weight were significantly greater for the hearts with lesions than for the hearts with no lesions, which suggests that cardiac remodeling, particularly hypertrophy, had occurred.
The large percentage of hearts with cardiac remodeling from asymptomatic market pigs demonstrates an increased probability that subclinical cardiac abnormalities may exist in research pigs, especially those accessed through commercial channels.
Researchers should be aware of this likelihood if subclinical cardiac abnormalities could adversely affect their experimental findings.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate normal intraocular pressure (IOP) values of cattle, sheep, and goats with a rebound tonometer [TonoVet (TV)] and an applanation tonometer [Tono-Pen AVIA (TPA)] and to determine correction functions for the 2 devices.
For both instruments, regression formulas were calculated to correct the measurements.
Both tonometers can be used effectively to assess intraocular pressure in ruminants, using the specific regression formulas.


Abstract
Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are now regarded as a promising cell resource for tissue repair and regeneration, the optimal source of MSCs has not yet been determined.
The objective of this study was to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) in the future.
Umbilical cord MSCs were successfully isolated and passaged to 29 generations.


Abstract
The results of immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry demonstrated that LMSCs consistently expressed OCT-4 - a specific gene marker expressed in pluripotent stem cells - and markers associated with MSCs such as CD29, CD73, CD90, and CD105.
However, LMSCs lacked hematopoietic cell surface molecules such as CD34 and CD45.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine whether birth order influences piglet survival because of reduced uptake of maternal antibodies by the piglets born later in large litters.
Forty-five litters were serially allocated to one of 2 study groups.
The crèche group consisted of 18 litters for which the 205 piglets were removed to a warm box to prevent suckling until 4 h after delivery of the first pig, and the control group of 27 litters for which 306 piglets were allowed to suckle from birth.
The protein content of piglet blood and sow colostrum was determined with Brix refractometers.


Abstract
Few facets of biology vary more than functional traits and life-history traits.
To explore this vast variation, functional ecologists and population ecologists have developed independent approaches that identify the mechanisms behind and consequences of trait variation.
Collaborative research between researchers using trait-based and demographic approaches remains scarce.
We argue that this is a missed opportunity, as the strengths of both approaches could help boost the research agendas of functional ecology and population ecology.
Examples include the exploration of how functional trait × environment interactions affect vital rates and thus explain population trends and species occurrence; the coordination of seed traits and dispersal ability with the pace of life in plants; the incorporation of functional traits in dynamic energy budget models; or the discovery of linkages between microbial functional traits and the fast-slow continuum.
Despite their historical isolation, collaborative work between functional ecologists and population ecologists could unlock novel research pathways.
We call for an integrative research agenda to evaluate which and when traits are functional, as well as their ability to describe and predict life history strategies and population dynamics.
We highlight promising, complementary research avenues to overcome current limitations.
These include a more explicit linkage of selection gradients in the context of functional trait-vital rate relationships, and the implementation of standardised protocols to track changes in traits and vital rates over time at the same location and individuals, thus allowing for the explicit incorporation of trade-offs in analyses of covariation of functional traits and life-history traits.


Abstract
The objective of this work is to study the EKG of Senegalese black football players in comparison with sedentary adults of the same age by focusing on repolarization.
100 high-level football players and 50 Senegalese black sedentary adults have each had 12 classic recordings.
The ST segment elevation or depression presented no significant difference between both groups.
Early repolarization is more frequent in the sportsmen's compared to the sedentary but without significant statistical difference.
As for the QTc interval, no significant difference between the two groups was noted.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to report the real-life experience of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) patients in order to note apprehensions and postoperative feedback.
This prospective study involving 300 patients of the Cocody Teaching Hospital, was carried out over a four month period.
It included 158 men and 142 women with an average age of 40 years.
OGD was performed on outpatients (78%) and hospitalized patients (22%).
The feelings of patients before EGD were marked by anxiety (91%) or serenity (9%).
88% of the patients received premedication versus 12% who did not.
This premedication was based on midazolam in 69.31% of cases and diazepam in 30.69%.
No incident or accident related to the procedure or to the premedication was reported.
The tolerance of the patients regarding OGD, as reported by the patients and doctors, was good (78% vs 78% respectively), acceptable (17% vs 16.67%) or bad (5% vs 5.33%).
Patients found the examination to be unpleasant (43.34%), painful (30.33%) or painless (26.33%).
Doctors reported that patients' attitudes were marked by anxiety (91%) and serenity (9%).
Age, sex, previous information on the examination, psychological preparation, the feelings of the patients before the examination and premedication with hypnovel or valium did not influence the tolerance of patients since the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05).
89.33% of our patients would accept a repeat of the digestive endoscopy versus 10.67% who would not.
Almost all the patients (99.33%), would recommend an OGD to another person versus only 0.67% who would not.
83.33% of patients were satisfied with the OGD versus 16.67% who were not.
The OGD remains bearable with 78% of patients presenting a good tolerance despite the important number of patients (91%) who felt anxious before the examination.


Abstract
Synovial osteochondromatosis is a disease characterized by a benign metaplastic cartilaginous proliferation.
There are very few studies on synovial osteochondromatosis in Sub Saharan Africa.
We report on 10 observations.
We conducted a retrospective study carried out from January 2004 to December 2008, in Synovial osteochondromatosis patients attending the Rheumatology Unit of the Yaounde Central Hospital.
We studied 3 women and 7 men, with an average age of 27 years±13 (range: 14 and 89 years old).
The knee was the most affected joint (observed in 9 cases) and the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb was affected in 1 case.
Pain was constant, and joint motion limitation was observed in 6 cases, swelling of the joint in 4 cases, cracking of the joint in 2 cases and nodules were noted in 1 case.
None of these patients presented an inflammatory syndrome.
Radiological signs were: calcified chondromas in all 10 cases, associated with degenerative lesions in 3 cases.
Every patient received an analgesic and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.
Only 3 patients (patients 1, 4 and 5) underwent surgical synovectomy.
None of the patients underwent arthroscopic surgery or synoviorthesis.


Abstract
No case was reported before in Benin.

Young patients accounted for 6.8% of MI admissions with a male predominance of 90%.
Typical chest pain was the most common recorded symptom.
Anterior necrosis was the most common of electrical pattern, 8 out 10 times the ejection fraction was down and segmental kinetic was impaired in 60% of patients on echocardiography.
Over 3 quarters of patients were admitted 12 hours after the onset of symptoms and the evolution during hospitalization was good with no fatality.


Abstract
Urachal cyst is difficult to diagnose and is a rare malformation and the authors report a case in a 10-month old boy.
The malformation was associated with posterior urethral valve and simple surgical treatment was successful.
The authors emphasize the contribution of perineal ultrasound in the diagnosis of associated posterior urethral valves.


Abstract
The effectiveness of the management of the disease depends on early and observance of the anti bacillary.

Abstract
To identify the infectious agents responsible for acute diarrheas in children from 0 to 5 years, with the aim of improving care, we led a cross-sectional prospective study at the Pediatric University hospital Charles de Gaulle from January 1st - November 30th, 2009.
A sample of 103 children's stools hospitalized for acute diarrhea was analyzed.
The average age of the patients was of 9.5 months and the most affected age bracket was the one from 0 to 12 months.
More than half of the cases of diarrheas (60.2%) had an infectious etiology of which 33% of viral origin, 21.4% bacterial, 9.7% parasitic and in 9.7% of the cases a co-infection.
In the viral diarrheas, rotavirus was observed in 17.5% of the cases and serotypes adenoviruses 40, 41 in 15.5% of the cases.
The isolated bacteria were essentially represented by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (21 cases).
This bacterium had a strong resistance to amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole (90%) as well as in the amoxicillin+Clavulanic acid (57%).
The ascendancy of rotavirus in the etiology of the acute diarrheas of children from 0 to 5 years hints to a need for vaccination against this infectious agent.
Aside from the ineffectiveness of group A penicillins and of the cotrimoxazole against most of the isolated bacteria calls to medical prescribers to reconsider antibiotic treatment in the diarrheas of the children.


Abstract
We report three new cases of sub-occipital Pott disease (C1-C2) seen at the University Hospital of Cocody (Abidjan) with their clinical features.
In the first case, the mode of revelation was original and unique: an incomplete Brown-Séquard syndrome.
The second case provided warning about the dangers of self-medication and untimely antibiotic usage.
The third case informed about the imperative to make the differential diagnosis.
The histological or bacteriological arguments led to the diagnosis in the first two cases, associated with a visceral localization.
Therapeutic evidence was required in the third case.
The sub-occipital Pott's disease remains a rare localization.


Abstract
Heavy smoking causes 4 million deaths worldwide, more than 70% being in the developing countries.
The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of heavy smoking and to identify the factors which influence it in school settings in Bamako.
We carried out a cross-sectional investigation in April 2009, in 8 randomly selected schools in a town of Bamako, with a sample of 328 pupils over 11 years of age.
The investigation included 328 pupils, among them, 72.3% were boys.
The age of the pupils varied between 12 and 23 years.
The age group 12-15 ans was the most represented with 66.2%.
It appears that 47.6% of the pupils smoked cigarettes at least once.
We found that 14% of the pupils (46/328), all boys, were regular smokers.
Among these heavy smokers, 37% smoked more than 5 cigarettes per day and 52% had consumption period of more than 12 months.
The factors supporting the heavy smoking were: father smoker (22.56%), other family member smoker (56.4%), smoker teachers (52.7%).
The main motivations which pushed the pupils to smoke were promiscuity (63%) pleasure (22%) and snobbery (13%).
While 85.9% of the pupils knew the harmfulness of the tobacco, 38.7% learned it at school, but 76,5% were unaware of the existence of a law on tobacco sale and consumption in Mali.
The prevalence of heavy smoking among pupils was of 14% in an inciting environment.
We recommend intensifying the communication for behavior change and applying the tobacco law.


Abstract
The sacrococcygeal teratoma is a rare congenital embryonal tumor with high potential for malignant transformation and therefore considered as a neonate surgical emergency.
The authors report two cases of sacrococcygeal teratomas with late diagnosis and treatment.
The first case was a degenerated sacrococcygeal teratoma revealed by paraplegia in a 17-month-old infant with multiple metastasis and fatal outcome.
The second case was a 14-month-old infant with a benign infected form of sacrococcygeal teratoma, successfully treated surgically.
The authors highlight the diagnostic difficulties still existing in the tropical environment, and recall the need for a prenatal diagnosis and early treatment.


Abstract
The hydatid cyst of the mesentery is a rare localization of hydatid disease; most often it is secondary to a hydatid cyst of the liver.
Its primitive form remains exceptional and is due to an arterial haematogenous dissemination.
We report a case of primary hydatid cyst of the mesentery in a patient of 43 years.
The diagnosis was established by ultrasonography and computed tomography with positive hydatid serology.
The aim of this work is to remind, through this observation and a literature review, clinical aspects and therapeutic management of this disease.


Abstract
This was a prospective study ranging from March 1st 2003 to March 30th 2004, including all patients older than 15 years of age hospitalized for nephrotic syndrome.
Ages ranged between 26 and 40 years with a mean of 26.2 ± 8.1 years.
All viral serology tests were negative.
The glomerular lesions observed were segmental and focal glomerular sclerosis in 40%, followed by minimal glomerular lesions for 35%, membranous glomerulonephritis in 5% of the cases and in 15% of the cases, the lesions were indeterminate.
Further studies should be done on a greater scale on one hand, and on the other move towards finding the primary or secondary causes of these glomerulopathies.


Abstract
A prospective study was conducted at the department of the National Hospital in Niamey, Niger Lamordé over a period of 12 months (from January 1 to December 31, 2009) on 99 patients on chronic hemodialysis.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic aspects of arterial hypertension in this population.
The average age was 37 years (range 17 to 65) , the prevalence of arterial hypertension was 61.61 %.
The most common functional signs are headache, present in 29.50 % of patients, dizziness in 24.59% and phosphenes in 18.03% of them.
Low arterial hypertension was found in 21.32%, mild for 44.26% of patients and severe in 34.42%, tachycardia in 21.31% and heart murmur in 19.67% of them.
The dominant etiologies of chronic renal failure in this series remain the chronic glomerulonephritis in 62.30% of cases and the nephroangiosclerosis in 36.06 % of the cases.
Cardiomegaly is found in more than half of the patients, the atrial and ventricular hypertrophy in 39.34% and repolarization disorders in 19.67% of them.
The systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients have been standardized in 26.22% under dialysis alone, dialysis plus inhibitor of angiotensin conversion enzyme alone 44.26%, or associated with a calcium channel blocker with 21.33%, and in 8.19% of them arterial hypertension resisted.
At the end of this study, there is a high prevalence of arterial hypertension with cardiac resonance in patients on chronic hemodialysis, and its mechanism appears to be natural or volo-dependent, renin-dépendant or both.


Abstract
The authors report the first case of amyloidosis diagnosed by histology and documented in Mali.
The patient was a young lady of 31 years old who was hospitalized in internal medicine at the University Hospital of "Point G" for edema and ascites syndrome.
She had a history of diarrhea, fever, vomiting, exercise dyspnea and diffused abdominal pain.
The biological assessment such as HIV serology was negative.
The research of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum was positive.
The diagnosis hypothesis of amyloidosis has been evoked and a biopsy of the rectal mucosa has been performed.
The fragments showed by histology an acellular band between the basal membrane and the periglandular area.
This band was stained in red by Rouge Congo.
That confirmed the diagnosis of amyloidosis.


Abstract
Therapeutic indications depend on the duration of the invagination.


Abstract
Benign tumors are frequently encountered pathologies on the oral mucosa.
They comprise a number of different lesions, including fibrous epulis.
Its diagnosis is only possible by histological examination.
We are presenting the case of a patient who consulted for an externalized maxillary swelling.
The treatment was surgical excision of the tumor.
Histological examination concluded that there was a lack of cytonuclear atypia and retained the diagnosis suggesting atypical fibrous epulis.
We reviewed the clinical data, diagnosis and treatment of this type of tumor.


Abstract
Clinical signs include a macular star, with or without peripheral retinoschisis, responsible for decreased visual acuity.

The curative treatment is surgical.
The outcome was favorable.


Abstract
In 2013, the WHO considered that worldwide, the annual incidence of the tuberculosis is of 9 million cases, and prevalence at 14 million.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the epidemiological and diagnostic aspects of tuberculosis in children.
The average age of children was of 4.6 years, with a sex-ratio of 1.43.
Extrapulmonary effects are more frequent than pulmonary (62.07% versus 37.93%).
IDR was positive in 85.71% of the children; the sedimentation speed was high in 88.89% of them.
The HIV serology tests were administered to 27.59% of the children, all were seronegative.
The fight against tuberculosis has to intensify, through the combination of several strategies, such as vaccination, active screening, the adequate care of the cases, improvement of socioeconomic conditions of the populations and research for a new more effective vaccine, news methods of diagnostic and antituberculosis drugs successful.

Abstract
Malaria is a major public health problem in Niger.
It is in this context that we have conducted a randomized comparative double open-arm study of the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AM) in Gaya.
The objective of the study is to evaluate and then to compare the efficiency and tolerance to these two combinations.
The study was modeled with the WHO 2003, 28 days protocol.
370 febrile patients were examined.
159 patients were included, where 79 (49.4%) were put in the AL arm and 81 (50.6%) were placed in the AM arm.
The adequate clinical and parasitological response was 94.8% and 97.1% respectively for AL and AM.
There was no statistical significant difference in efficiency between the two therapies (P=0.4).
This difference in adverse effects was not statistically significant (P=0.18).
Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine are two combinations with comparable efficacies and safety.

Abstract
In Mali, despite the existence of a national vaccination policy, coverage of neonatal tetanus remains low.
According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) IV Mali, the rate of births protected against neonatal tetanus is 56%.
The objective of this study was to investigate the status of tetanus toxoid (TT) in women of reproductive age (WRA) in the municipality V of Bamako District.
The study was conducted in Mali in the municipality V of the Bamako District.
This was a cross-sectional study conducted from July to October 2006.
The target population was composed of women of reproductive age and health care providers.
A total of 262 people, including 200 women of childbearing age and 62 health care providers were interviewed.
The age group 14-23 years accounted for 39% of WRA.
Among WRA surveyed, 76.2% were vaccinated where 66.7% had received between 2 and 10 doses of TT.
Women who received no dose of TT were nulliparous and primiparous.
The main reasons given by women who had not received vaccination were lack of knowledge (47.6%), lack of time (14.3%) and neglect (23.8%).
The health personnel interviewed spoke of running out of TT stocks less than a week after receiving new orders, in 7/11 health centers.
Strengthening Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) for tetanus vaccination and immunization schedule compliance will increase tetanus vaccination coverage.
To avoid stockouts, we recommend a regular and sufficient reorder of TT in health centers.


Abstract
We report two observations of congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed in 2011 in the university hospital of Gabriel Toure in Bamako.
The first occurred in a male infant of 40 days, admitted for respiratory distress and anterior compressive cervical swelling.
Neurological examination was normal with the presence of constipation.
A cervical-thoracic scan showed a homogeneous and symmetric hypertrophy of thyroid lobes with a compression of the trachea.
The dosage of thyroid hormones confirmed hypothyroidism (FT4 = 1.6 pmol/l, TSH = 60 µUI/ml).
After one month of treatment using Levothyroxine, 10 mg/kg, there was a drastic improvement of respiratory distress, a regression of goiter and normalization of thyroid hormones.
At six months of life he had no goiter and psychomotor development was normal.
The second case occurred in a male infant of 2 years, from an area of endemic goiter.
Puffiness of the face without lower limb edema, constipation, and delayed independent walking were the reasons for consultation.
On examination, we noted the absence of goiter, large anterior fontanel with facial dysmorphism (lunar facies, hypertelorism, flat nose, macroglossia) and infiltration of the skin more marked in the face with cold extremities.
He required support to sit.
The thyroid function tests confirmed hypothyroidism (FT4 = 72 nmol/l, FT3 = 0.40 nmol/l, TSH > 60 µUI/l).
Under levothyroxine, there was normalization of thyroid hormones after one month of treatment and disappearance of the skin infiltration.
At six months of treatment he had acquired independent walking.
Mental prognosis remains to be evaluated.
These cases confirm the necessity of routine neonatal diagnosis of hypothyroidism.


Abstract
Calcium and magnesium are divalent multipotent ions playing a major role in metabolism, excitability and neuroglial plasticity.
Because of these multiple properties, their deficiency induces complex brain processes leading to acute or even lasting disorders in excitability and neural networks.
These ions are usually prescribed in clinical contexts of neuronal hyperexcitability such as preeclampsia and chronic stress.
Our aim was to evaluate whether magnesium at 20 mg/kg and calcium at 100 mg/kg could improve the memory prognosis in the kainic model of mesial temporal epilepsy in mice.
The animals were organized into 6 groups: control group (without kainate), reference group (GR) without administration of ions, groups treated with magnesium or calcium from the third day (respectively G1m, G1c), groups treated with magnesium or calcium from the third week (respectively G2m, G2c).
The mice treated by ions performed better than GR mice, but magnesium was more effective.
Memory (short term-long term) was differently affected by kainate or improved by magnesium-calcium.
In addition, magnesium demonstrated an increasing therapeutic effect over time while calcium had an acute and apparently decreasing action in the G1c group that received calcium early.

In pregnant women, causes are sometime life-threating for the mother and the fetus.


Abstract
Nonobstetric emergencies are frequent during pregnancy.


Abstract
Hemorrhoids affect up to 85 % of pregnant women during the last two trimesters.
The maximum incidence for anal fissure is 20 %.
One of the common risk factors is constipation promoted during pregnancy.
The history of anal pathology, the length of delivery and the baby's birth weight also promote these two entities.
The treatment includes above all hygiene and dietary measures to prevent constipation and conservative measures (local anesthetics, sitz baths).
Surgical procedures should be avoided and indicated only in case of failure of conservative treatment.
Rectal prolapse is more rare and must be reduced manually before surgery.
Measures to prevent constipation also apply.


Abstract
The physiological changes in the pregnant woman expose her to a risk of faster respiratory decompensation.
Asthma affects 2-13% of pregnancies.
It is therefore important to ensure regular monitoring to allow good control of asthma to reduce the risk of exacerbations.
Finally, the background treatment, such as exacerbations, must be identical to the treatment of other patients.

Abstract
Prevalence of and risk factors for equine glandular and squamous gastric disease in polo horses.
The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence rates and risk factors for equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) and equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) in a population of 63 polo horses in competition.
The prevalence of EGGD grade ≥ 1 was 69% and EGGD ≥ 2 was 31%.
The prevalence of ESGD grade ≥ 1 was 54% and grade ≥ 2 was 37%.
Decreasing weekly exercise duration was the only risk factor associated with ESGD grade ≥ 2.
Equine gastric disease was common in this population of polo horses and the amount of experience and weekly exercise duration were related to the risk of disease.

The frequency of thrombotic events in polycythemia vera (and more particularly myocardial infarction), their predictive factors, pathophysiology and treatment will be discussed.


Abstract
Three main parameters will influence this choice: the functional status of the cyst, its malignant potential and the potential complications related to the cyst.
Current recommendations suggest a surgical treatment for all symptomatic cysts, for functional cysts, for cysts with a diameter exceeding 5 cm, for hemorrhagic cysts and for cysts with malignant imaging potential.
The progress and surgical advantages brought by the development of laparoscopy make it the first technique to be chosen.


Abstract
Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare condition that refers to a clinical syndrome resulting from the accumulation of mucin in the peritoneal cavity.
It results from the intraperitoneal rupture of a mucinous epithelial neoplasm which is classically appendiceal.
The prognosis of a limited appendiceal tumor is favourable.
Nevertheless, in the case of peritoneal dissemination, the prognosis could be different according to the histological type and therapeutic management.
We report the case of a 71-year-old female patient who developed a pseudomyxoma peritonei originating from an appendiceal adenocarcinoma.

Abstract
Brain metastases occur in 1 to 4 % of patients with colorectal cancer and are unique in 0.5 % of them.
Because of their infrequent nature, brain imaging is not recommended in the systematic follow-up of these patients.
We report here an exceptional case of a unique brain metastasis in a very unusual position.
An 82-year-old patient with a colorectal cancer of the splenic angle that was treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, developed a series of neurological symptoms over four to six weeks: difficulty swallowing, loss of strength in the four limbs and balance disorders.
These symptoms urged the performance of a nuclear magnetic resonance to exclude a central neurological lesion.
MRI revealed a nodular tumor of 20 millimeters in the major transverse axis and 17 millimeters in the cerebro-caudal axis, located on the ventral portion of the protuberance.
Because of its localization, surgery was not possible and the lesion was treated with Cyberknife radiosurgery.
Thanks to the treatment, the lesion decreased in size and the symptoms improved significantly.
Despite an initially very poor prognosis in view of the localization of the metastasis, the patient is alive and in excellent general condition more than eight months after the diagnosis of recurrence.

Abstract
Suicide is a major public health issue in Canada.
The quality of health care services, in addition to other individual and population factors, has been shown to affect suicide rates.
This status report paper describes a project we are conducting at the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) with the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS) in collaboration with colleagues from Wales (United Kingdom) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
This study describes the development of quality of care indicators at three levels and the corresponding statistical analysis strategies designed.


Abstract
Multiple myeloma is the second most frequent hematological malignancy.
Unfortunately, it is still incurable.
A better understanding of the myeloma pathophysiology favored the development of new therapeutic molecules that improved both survival and quality of life of patients.


Abstract
Chemotherapy is the principal treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.


Abstract
Four molecules are currently available in clinical practice.
They were first studied for non-small cell cancers in the second and third line of treatment with a significant improvement in overall survival, then in maintenance treatment and more recently in the front line with a significant response.
Their complications, mainly dysimmune adverse effects, are protean but immunotherapy remains better tolerated than chemotherapy.
It opens many perspectives but further studies, including biomarkers, are still needed.

Abstract
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), with empagliflozin in EMPA-REG
OUTCOME
, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), with liraglutide in LEADER, have proven their ability to reduce major cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
The choice should be based upon a personalized approach, which has to take into account the drug properties, especially the tolerance profile, and patient's individual characteristics.
In patients with heart failure, the added value of a SGLT2i appears obvious while in those with advanced renal insufficiency, current evidence favours the use of a GLP-1RA.


Abstract
After metformin monotherapy, the choice between a sulfonylurea and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor may be critical in clinical practice.
This article compares the cardiovascular safety of these two pharmacological classes based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies.
Both approaches show a better cardiovascular safety with DPP-4 inhibitors than with sulfonylureas.
The ongoing head-to-head prospective trial CAROLINA compares the cardiovascular safety of glimepiride and linagliptin in high-risk patients, with results expected in 2019.


Abstract
Gender disparity in plastic surgery in Canada is an important issue.

All members of the CSPS are encouraged to learn about gender disparity in order to work together to address this issue.


Abstract
The ability to minimise the harmful impact of biological threats relies on our capacity to rapidly detect unusual events, including the accidental or deliberate release of pathogenic or toxic agents, and immediately implement control measures.
The development of this capacity for each country is the aim of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), a legally binding document adopted by 196 States Parties, including all Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO).
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway allows countries to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of their Veterinary Services and identify areas that need improvement.
This enhanced dialogue improves operational coordination and more efficiently informs policy-makers on strategic investments to strengthen their preparedness for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases.


Abstract
Laboratory biosafety and biosecurity systems are used around the world to help to mitigate the risks posed by dangerous pathogens in the laboratory.
This paper will discuss the fundamentals of laboratory biosafety and biosecurity.


Abstract
Building capacity is synonymous with sustaining development.
Both are required to fuel progress and propel efforts towards heightening health and security.
The urgency to build capacity has been catalysed by an increasing number of sanitary crises, threats, and disease outbreaks that have spanned countries, regions and continents.
Differing cultural, religious and political beliefs, together with alternate economic priorities, have meant that countries have been advocating for education to meet their own specific needs, and not necessarily those of the international community.
This has resulted in discrepancies in the competencies acquired by veterinarians and their capacities to uphold good veterinary governance and practices.
To address this educational imbalance, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has drafted recommendations and guidelines to assist Veterinary Education Establishments worldwide with improving the breadth and depth of their veterinary curricula in order to strengthen their national Veterinary Services.


Abstract
The engagement of both scientists and veterinarians in strengthening biosecurity systems is of paramount importance to ensure resilience and sustainability.
Resilient and sustainable biosecurity systems also require an organisational culture that encourages, recognises and rewards scientists and veterinarians who are committed to biosecurity education, research, outreach and preparedness.
At present, such involvement is complicated by the range of definitions of biosecurity used in the life sciences and veterinary medicine, and by the various international organisations with biosecurity responsibilities.
Biosecurity represents both a public and a private good.
However, the priority given to biosecurity education, research, outreach and implementation differs widely among the public, private and academic sectors.
The public sector has the broadest engagement and the broadest mandate for biosecurity.
The private sector's approach to biosecurity is governed by business decisions and whether or not they produce consumer goods.


Abstract
Biological threats are a prime example of an issue that needs the 'One Health' approach.
This principle also applies to the involvement of other disciplines from the natural sciences and humanities.
This paper is not an exhaustive survey of integrated approaches but discusses concepts and methods and provides key examples of the benefits of a 'One Health' approach when applied to biological threats.
Such diseases are not always directly transmitted.
Contaminated food, water, air and soil represent important sources of transmission for foodborne and environmentally related diseases.
Therefore, this paper treats environmental sanitation separately because of the importance of the excreta management of humans and animals.
Integrated syndromic surveillance and antimicrobial resistance surveillance link the above aspects and are showcases for a 'One Health' approach to biological threat reduction.
Biological threats are not only related to natural conditions but may also be exacerbated by large development projects such as dams, mining and infrastructure.
Consequently, it is recommended that the health impact assessment (HIA) approach be implemented as early as the planning stage of any large infrastructure project located in a complex socioecological system.
This paper extends the HIA approach to an integrated 'One Health' impact assessment approach.


Abstract
The global community continues to incur the high costs of crisis mitigation and emergency response to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as those caused by the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, Zika virus or the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
These viruses are particularly dangerous in regions associated with poor development indicators and high vulnerability.
The drivers of these disease crises include failures in the way that animal diseases are detected and reported and failures in the way in which disease response is implemented by animal health and public health systems.
In addition, the lack of a coordinated response hampers disease control efforts.
The goal of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is to end hunger and poverty, which is a challenging and complex task.
Building global capacity to prepare for and respond to TADs is an important element of the FAO's strategic objective to increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises.
Each year, livestock, and the people who rely upon them for their livelihoods, are confronted with animal disease and crises.
They can strike suddenly, causing obvious illness and death, or emerge insidiously and become well established before becoming apparent.
Animal disease emergencies threaten the production of, and access to, food; consequently, one of the FAO's missions is to help countries to prepare for and respond to animal health disasters.


Abstract
This paper aims to compare responses to natural, accidental and deliberate biological events.
The author examines the characteristics of each type of biological event and reviews relevant international mechanisms for addressing disease outbreaks.


Abstract
In recent years, the OIE has also increasingly focused on the biosecurity objectives of preventing unauthorised access to and loss, theft, misuse or diversion of dangerous pathogens, including their intentional release.
Preventing the intentional introduction of animal disease is critical not only because of the significant economic impact that animal diseases can have on a nation's economy, but also because a number of animal diseases can affect humans.
Over 60% of human diseases are of animal origin.


Abstract
As observed in the 2013 investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, this mechanism can be an effective tool in the verification of and as a deterrent against the use of chemical and biological weapons.


Abstract
The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) was the first international treaty to effectively prohibit an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.
In its Preamble, the BWC clearly affirms the norm against the use of biology as a weapon by stating that such use would be 'repugnant to the conscience of mankind'.
Few would dispute the strength of the norm against biological weapons, but the BWC itself, as the legal and widely accepted embodiment of this norm, requires continuous support and attention.
Even after 40 years, it is not yet universal and its implementation is less than satisfactory.
In recent years, these meetings have been attended by a wide range of experts from national, regional and international entities from the public, private and civil sectors.
International organisations such as the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization have been regular participants in the BWC meetings and their contributions are much appreciated by BWC States Parties.
Cooperation and collaboration at the international level is also vital in facing the threats posed by the misuse of biological agents against humans, animals or plants.
However, the recent Eighth BWC Review Conference was only able to find agreement on a small number of issues, which could put into question the role the BWC should play in countering biological threats in the future.


Abstract
Pathogens represent a considerable and ever-present threat to animal health, agriculture-based economies, food safety, public health and food security.


Abstract
In spite of scientific progress, the world is still facing major biological threats.
Developing countries tend to be more vulnerable to such threats than developed countries owing to the poor resilience of their animal health systems, their advanced state of environmental degradation, their socio-economic fragility and their political instability.
The occurrence of emerging and re-emerging diseases (avian influenza, Ebola virus disease) has caused deep concern around the world in recent years and has shown how important it is for countries to strengthen the organisation of their Veterinary Services.
The Republic of Haiti is one of the developing countries with the most acute biophysical vulnerability.
Over the years, it has experienced a large number of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts and epidemics that have further weakened a country with already scarce financial resources.
However, Haiti is endeavouring to address biological threats by modernising its Veterinary Services and by implementing the animal health standards and guidelines of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for establishing resilient animal health systems.


Abstract
There is still much work to be done to further reduce the risk of a reoccurrence.


Abstract
Gaining control of the disease was the impetus for the founding of many regional and international organisations (including the World Organisation for Animal Health).
Outbreaks of rinderpest have led to food shortages and starvation, economic losses and poverty, social unrest, and disrupted transport networks in regions where agriculture was dependent on draught cattle.
The rinderpest virus, causative agent of the disease, has also been used as a biological weapon in the past.
Many regional rinderpest eradication campaigns have been implemented, including Joint Project 15; the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC); the South Asia Rinderpest Eradication Campaign; the West Asia Rinderpest Eradication Campaign; and the Pan African Programme for the Control of Epizootics.
All of these campaigns were supported by regional and international organisations, and the disease was finally eradicated in 2011.
The benefit of PARC in terms of the value of avoided losses in cattle products due to the decrease in the disease's occurrence was estimated to be between 581,000 and 35,433,000 European currency units.
Currently, the world is prepared to prevent the deliberate or accidental release of the remaining infectious rinderpest virus material which exists in research and diagnostic facilities across the world.


Abstract
Emerging infectious animal and zoonotic diseases can inflict significant losses on animal production and public health, and threaten the safety and security of the food system.
These plans should include surveillance, biosecurity measures, communication channels and training for personnel.
National and international legislation should be regularly updated to provide a robust legal basis to manage outbreaks.
Reference laboratories should have reliable and validated diagnostic tools for rapid, high-throughput testing.
Strict biosafety, biocontainment and biosecurity control measures must be implemented in laboratories in order to prevent the accidental or malicious release of pathogens.
The pharmaceutical industry should be incentivised to develop vaccines and/or antiviral drugs against disease outbreaks.
Conventions between public authorities and the pharmaceutical industry should guarantee adequate stockpiling of the pharmaceuticals needed to control large-scale outbreaks.
In the early phase of disease emergence (early warning), veterinarians and stakeholders play an important role in early detection at the farm level.
Upon notification, veterinary authorities must take rapid response measures to limit disease spread.
National and international short- and medium-term strategic research agendas should be developed, based on a comprehensive gap analysis and horizon scan.
This planning will help to guide funding agencies and non-governmental organisations in their quest to support relevant research.


Abstract
As a result, the biological threat to human health became a focus for many governments.


Abstract
Only two international organisations have a global legal framework that allows them to request, collect, and release global animal or human health information: the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which is responsible for transparently assessing the global animal health situation, and the World Health Organization (WHO), which is responsible for transparently assessing the global human health situation.
Legal instruments bind OIE Member Countries and WHO States Parties (OIE's Standards and WHO's International Health Regulations [IHR]) to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to their respective organisations.
OIE Member Countries must report exceptional epidemiological events involving any OIE-listed diseases, including zoonoses.
Moreover, they must notify the OIE of any emerging animal diseases.
The IHR require WHO Member States to provide notification of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern.
These include, but are not restricted to, outbreaks of communicable diseases of international concern.
In both organisations, in addition to reporting outbreaks and exceptional events, Members also monitor diseases on an ongoing basis and provide regular reports.
To complement these passive surveillance mechanisms, the OIE, WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations track signals from informal sources of outbreaks of animal and zoonotic infectious diseases, thereby increasing the sensitivity of worldwide disease reporting.
The formal information collected is disseminated to Members and the general public through various communication channels, so that countries can apply science-based measures to prevent further disease spread.
Both the OIE and WHO reporting systems are supported by a range of coordinating activities to ensure the proper flow of information between national and international levels.


Abstract
Information technologies are rapidly advancing the way in which animal health data and information are collected, analysed and shared in order to support animal health management, disease surveillance and response, and decision-making.
However, the full potential of these technologies for early detection and response to natural or intentional disease events has not been fully realised in animal health at the global level.
This paper discusses advances made in these technologies and examples of how they have been applied in animal health for near real-time data collection and analysis.
The technologies reviewed include: i) mobile health (mHealth) technologies, wireless sensors and biosensors for remote data collection; ii) crowdsourced and Internet-based data collection; and iii) electronic health (eHealth) technologies for data integration and analysis.
Experiences of implementing these technologies, and challenges with their use, are also discussed so as to provide recommendations on their future application in animal health.
The world is ripe with opportunities to develop and enhance mHealth and eHealth technologies that are cost effective and capable of near real-time data collection and analysis.
Such technologies have been shown to be valuable and capable of being implemented in both developing and developed countries, and ultimately will strengthen disease surveillance and reporting across the globe.
International mechanisms and data standards are needed to facilitate the sharing and analysis of animal and human health data between countries.


Abstract
Biosurveillance is crucial to detect, identify and minimise the negative consequences of infectious disease.
Its value to society and importance to global public health and global health security are growing.
This study conducted a systematic review to identify all extant and defunct biosurveillance systems from 1900 to 2016.
Of the 815 systems examined, the majority surveyed human, animal or plant data discretely.
The authors found a large increase in the number of global biosurveillance systems between 1900 and 2008, but a reduction in the number of biosurveillance systems from 2008 to the present.


Abstract
When human or animal cases are first recognised, molecular or serological diagnostic assays specific to them do not yet exist, causing a delay in the identification of an outbreak's aetiologic agent as well as its source.
Preparing for the next virus to emerge is a major public health challenge, impeded by a poor understanding of the diversity of potential candidates that exist in wildlife reservoirs.
Characterising the diversity of viruses in key wildlife species will help to reduce the time between detection and response in an outbreak situation, and inform public health strategies that reduce the risk of spillover from animal reservoirs.
Pathogen discovery techniques such as consensus polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been used to identify known and novel viruses in animals and humans, but have not been widely used in surveillance programmes.
Metagenomic studies have identified novel viruses, new strains of known viruses, and have characterised host microbiomes.
While NGS represents an unbiased approach to viral sequence detection, it is constrained by lower sensitivity than conventional PCR, requires substantial bioinformatics capabilities, and is cost prohibitive and therefore not widely available in the regions of the world that are most vulnerable to zoonotic disease emergence.
Here, the authors review pathogen discovery techniques currently being used in human and animal surveillance programmes and the challenges of using viral discovery to identify novel zoonotic pathogens.


Abstract
There is a solid theoretical basis for expecting climate change to have a considerable effect on the infectious diseases of humans, animals and plants.
Vector-borne diseases are the most likely to be affected.
Bluetongue emerged dramatically in southern Europe after 1998 and in northern Europe from 2006.


Abstract
Rarely are individual biotechnologies included on lists of potential security threats.
When they are, a broad range of advances are usually considered collectively - in terms of both risks and benefits.
Their implications are different and so are the possible policy and regulatory responses.


Abstract
Animal diseases, including zoonoses, can be both a precursor to social instability and a result of social instability.
Coping mechanisms, such as sound policies, trust in government, and robust infrastructure break down at times of civil instability.
Such breakdowns often lead to a decline in both public health and the food and agricultural livestock base, thus creating a vicious cycle that involves inadequate nutrition, threatened livelihoods, and fewer opportunities for safe trade.
This article is principally a discussion of a theoretical nature on the dynamics between animal diseases and social instability.
Based on their experience of working for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the authors provide numerous examples of the connection between the two, mostly in countries that have fragile environments and are experiencing protracted crises.
Stability, therefore, depends on a variety of factors, including the ability of a community to overcome the effects of a disease outbreak or other destabilising event.
The FAO approach to helping families and communities to cope with the destabilizing effects of animal diseases is to build resilience, particularly amongst the most vulnerable households.
This requires individuals and governments to gain a better understanding of what drives disease at the interface between human and animal health.
In addition, it requires governments to invest in social protection programmes, establish a long-term risk reduction strategy that decreases vulnerability, and improve the sustainability of safe agricultural and marketing practices.


Abstract
Since 1940, the rate of infectious disease emergence events has risen.


Abstract
Animal pathogens and their impact on animal health, the economy, food security, food safety and public health.
These impacts are felt at the household, national, regional and global levels.
They focus on the impact of these diseases in the context of high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, comparing and contrasting their impact at the national and individual household levels.


Abstract
As is made clear in this paper, of the pathogens weaponised in the 20th century by Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the United States and Iraq, most were zoonotic pathogens.
If a nation or terrorist group were to acquire biological weapons in the future, it is most likely that their payload would be a zoonotic pathogen.


Abstract
Animal diseases, including zoonoses, have the potential to negatively impact economies, the environment, society and public health.
As new diseases and/or strains emerge, they travel freely and do not respect political borders.


Abstract
It has been 11 years since the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) published a Scientific and Technical Review on bioterrorism, which was entitled 'Biological disasters of animal origin: The role and preparedness of veterinary and public health services'.
Since the 2006 review, much in our world has changed.


Abstract
The framework includes financial inputs that can be separated between core investments and day-to-day expenditures.
The latter financial inputs should differentiate between avoiding losses in production and reducing wider societal impacts such as negative implications for trade and the environment.
It discusses an application of the framework using existing data, which highlighted problems with measuring and costing veterinary inputs, and with quantifying the range of outputs and the impact of veterinary activities.
The paper recommends that the framework proposed is reviewed and compared with work that has been carried out on the human health accounting systems.
Data sets are also needed on animal health outcomes in order to compare investments with animal health outcomes and thereby: demonstrate the success of previous investments, identify weaknesses in the investment profile and ensure that future investments sustain an animal health system, which functions well.

Liver transplantation yields excellent outcomes in advanced cases.


Abstract
Endosonography is an effective diagnostic procedure for intraluminal, parietal and extradigestive pathologies with superior resolution compared to other imaging modalities.


Abstract
The focus of the new 2018 EASL recommendations is on screening for high-risk drinking, the importance of early diagnosis of liver fibrosis, and the modulation of factors that can influence evolution.
The drug treatment of steatohepatitis is limited to corticosteroid therapy dictated by the Lille score.
Abstinence remains the cornerstone of management and should, at the cirrhosis stage, be associated with the prevention of complications.
Abstinence and correction of cofactors may be associated with partial regression of fibrosis during follow-up and thus constitute an additional objective.


Abstract
Screening for HCC by bi-annual ultrasound is indicated in most cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients.
The detection of a new hepatic lesion should raise the suspicion of HCC, especially in cirrhotic subjects.
The diagnostic and therapeutic management of HCC is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.


Abstract
In addition, they are associated with a major socio-economic impact.


Abstract
Of these, 10 % will develop symptomatic infection, bacteremia, septic choc or death.
Traumatic complications of IUC are seldom studied, but are at least as frequent as the infectious complications of IUC, with similar impact on LOS or morbidity.


Abstract
During recent years, food fraud has emerged as a potential threat to various countries, with direct implications for public health and international trade in livestock commodities.


Abstract
This paper presents the features of a system for the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of data regarding the health status of pets in the Veneto region (Italy).
The system involved the construction of a Web-based database containing the diagnoses of transmissible and non-transmissible diseases of dogs and cats made by veterinarians in their practices, hospitals, kennels and catteries.
Each diagnosis constitutes a single record, also containing data on the identification of the individual animal and on several characteristics of epidemiological relevance.
The World Health Organization (WHO) 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) for human diseases has been adapted to canine and feline diseases to standardise the diagnostic nomenclature.
Software has been specifically created for online data entry and data management.
The first results show that the main disorders were digestive (21%), dermatological (18%) and cardiovascular (11%) among 1,087 diagnostic records in dogs, and digestive (23%), dermatological (15%) and urinary (14%) among 289 diagnostic records in cats.
The main causes of death are represented by cardiovascular (21%) and gastrointestinal (21%) diseases in dogs and by urinary (31%) disorders in cats.
At present, no institutional surveillance system for companion animal health exists in Italy, and veterinarians joining this project and sharing the outcomes of their clinical activity are acting on a voluntary basis.


Abstract
Small ruminant production is one of the main sources of meat in Algeria and plays a vital role in the country's food security.
This review describes the main infectious diseases that have an impact on small ruminant production in Algeria.
It also discusses the adopted control measures for these diseases.
The epidemiological status of small ruminant diseases in Algeria is striking and the main infectious diseases threatening its small ruminant industry are peste des petits ruminants, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, sheep pox/goat pox, brucellosis and Rift Valley fever.
Therefore, the establishment of early warning systems and the proper implementation of control measures are needed in order to prevent, control and/or eradicate these diseases that have a significant impact on Algeria's economy.


Abstract
Toxoplasmosis, a cosmopolitan zoonosis, is caused by an apicomplexan, obligate, intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii.
Nearly all animals, including humans, are at risk owing to its broad geographical distribution.
The authors searched published data related to T. gondii in databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct for South Asian countries, and retrieved a total of 113 articles fulfilling the criterion of seroprevalence investigation.
Toxoplasma gondii infection in livestock and humans was investigated using various serological tests.
In these studies, a total of 14,431 samples from domestic animals and 53,899 samples from humans were screened for anti-T. gondii antibodies in all South Asian countries.
Among the animals, cattle (n = 1,981), goats (n = 3,285), buffaloes (n = 1,695), sheep (n = 1,747), cats (n = 1,480), camels (n = 435), elephants (n = 45), pigs (n = 920), dogs (n = 1,604) and poultry (n = 1,206) were tested.
This comprehensive review will be useful to biologists, public health workers, physicians and veterinarians and provides a better understanding of the distribution of T. gondii in this region.
Furthermore, this knowledge will support efforts to find and apply effective prevention measures to better manage this zoonosis in South Asian countries.


Abstract
As parasitaemia is low and fluctuating during the chronic stage of infection, accurate detection of Trypanosoma evansi in blood is difficult.
The primary aims of this investigation were to assess for the first time the seroprevalence of T. evansi in all agro-climatic zones of Punjab, by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) and card agglutination test (CATT/T. evansi), and to evaluate the risk factors associated with latent trypanosomosis.
A total of 319 equine serum samples collected from 12 districts of Punjab (India) belonging to different agro-climatic zones revealed 39 (12.23%) and 9 (2.82%) samples to be positive by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively.
The highest prevalence was recorded from the Ludhiana district (42.86% and 7.14% by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively) in the central plain zone (for which the overall prevalence was 15% and 4.17%, respectively).
Species was the most influential risk factor for infection, with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.81 and 5.63 for donkeys/ mules, in comparison with horses, by CATT/T. evansi and iELISA, respectively.
The female equine population (OR = 3.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32-7.67 [CATT]) was found to be at a higher risk of seropositivity for T. evansi, particularly on 'unorganised' (inappropriately managed) farms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI = 1.53- 6.65 [CATT]) and among animals used for commercial purposes (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.20-5.21 [CATT]).
In conclusion, to declare disease-free status, use of the iELISA followed by retesting of suspect samples by CATT/T. evansi is suggested.


Abstract
Equatorial Guinea (EG) is a country in Central Africa with typical tropical weather.
Sheep are an important source of food in EG, but the absence of information regarding infectious diseases that affect the native flocks of small ruminants is a concern.
The country is currently implementing several new practices in the sheep industry associated with the importation of sheep from other countries.
This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of bacterial infections that are important to the sheep industry in EG sheep flocks.
The detection of specific antibodies for the four agents studied was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 1,002 serum samples from EG sheep.
The results showed a true prevalence of 13.37% for antibodies against Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, 0.59% for Brucella ovis, 19.89% for Chlamydophila abortus and 0.79% for Mycoplasma agalactiae in animals from production flocks.
Among a group of 35 samples from isolated native animals, 47.56% were seropositive for antibodies against C. pseudotuberculosis, 42.84% for B. ovis, 54.28% for C. abortus and 11.35% for M. agalactiae.
These results comprise the first report of the prevalence of infectious diseases in sheep in EG.
They highlight the importance of adopting adequate measures to prevent infection by bacteria endemic to EG native flocks during the development of the sheep industry in the country.


Abstract
Clostridium perfringens is an important anaerobic pathogen causing food-borne gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in humans and animals.
Meat and meat products are the most common vehicles of C. perfringens type A food poisoning.
Contamination of meat by the intestinal contents of slaughtered animals may serve as an important source of this pathogen to the food supply.
Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay to determine the toxin genotype of C. perfringens isolates, and extraction and purification of C. perfringens enterotoxin from enterotoxin gene (cpe)-positive isolates were carried out.
The homogeneity of the purified enterotoxin was demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
In addition, stool samples were collected from 150 persons who had been in contact with animals, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out for the qualitative determination of C. perfringens enterotoxin in the stool samples.
The results demonstrated that approximately 2.6% of the tested meat and retail meat samples were contaminated with cpe-positive C. perfringens.
The recommended laboratory criteria used to implicate C. perfringens in food-borne disease should involve the detection of C. perfringens enterotoxin production or the presence of the cpe gene in foods or faeces, or in the suspected C. perfringens isolates.
In the present study some isolates such as tuna contained the enterotoxin gene although they had a low count of C. perfringens.


Abstract
The authors present a study that estimates the prevalence, sensitivity to antibiotics and distribution of Salmonella spp. serotypes in 20 broiler turkey farm buildings in the north-west of Morocco.
(35%) and the serotypes isolated were alarming.
The Salmonella spp. antimicrobial resistance results showed that 93.5% (58/62) of the strains were resistant to at least one antibiotic.
Multi-resistant strains (resistant to three or more antibiotics) accounted for 80.64% of the strains isolated.
The percentage with resistance to ceftazidime (third-generation cephalosporin), ceftriaxone and cefotaxime was lower at 4.8%.
Three strains of S. Agona with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase were detected, with a high level of resistance to ceftriaxone and a minimum inhibitory concentration of 16 µg/ml.
The variables associated with contamination are linked to: the cleanout period (p = 0.037); antibiotic treatment (p = 0.001); infection of turkey poults at placement (p = 0.002); manure storage (p = 0.003); keeping sick turkeys in the turkey house (p = 0.009); the season (p = 0.001); and the age of the turkeys at the time of sampling (p = 0.01).


Abstract
A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the level of knowledge about brucellosis among livestock farmers and their families, veterinary personnel, food processors and other people involved in the cattle supply chain in the province of Manabí.
A voluntary, open-ended survey of participants was conducted in seven cantons in Manabí province selected at random: Bolívar, Chone, El Carmen, Jama, Junín, Sucre and Tosagua.
Greater knowledge about the disease was observed among people with a higher educational level, veterinarians, livestock farmers/traders and men.


Abstract
Eighty-four Murciano-Granadina dairy goats slaughtered in the region of Murcia (South-East Spain) were necropsied to evaluate parasitic infections.
The majority of the animals (94.0%) were parasitised and multiple infections were present.
Statistically significant differences between the prevalence of lungworms and gastrointestinal nematodes in Mycobacterium spp. infected and free goats were found.
The paper discusses this co-infection between Mycobacteriaceae and endoparasites.


Abstract
Maedi-visna (MV) is a chronic viral disease prevalent in adult sheep that is caused by a virus belonging to the small ruminant lentivirus group (SRLV).
This disease is considered to affect the international trade of sheep and is classified in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) list of notifiable animal diseases.
Although maedi-visna virus (MVV) has been detected in many countries, no study on its occurrence has been carried out in Lebanon.
For this purpose, a serological survey of infection with MVV was conducted in seven of the eight Lebanese governorates using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
A total of 184 individual blood samples from sheep of the local breed 'Awassi', originating from 16 farms distributed throughout the seven Lebanese governorates, were collected and analysed.
Among the 184 tested sheep, 131 sheep from the16 farms visited were MVV positive.
This presents a prevalence of 71% MVV-positive animals and 100% MVV-positive farms.
The results indicate the need for further systematic investigations into the between-herd and within-herd prevalence of MV in Lebanon.


Abstract
African horse sickness virus (AHSV) is one of the most devastating viral diseases of the family Equidae.
Infection with AHSV threatens not only the Saudi equine industry but also the equine industry worldwide.
This is due to the high morbidity and mortality rates among the infected population of up to 100%.
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) lists AHSV among its notifiable diseases; this requires Member Countries to monitor the situation with regard to AHSV very carefully in order to avoid the spread of the virus.
The OIE also suggests the systematic monitoring of AHSV in the equine population at regular intervals.
The main aim of the current study is to perform molecular and serological surveillance on different horse populations in eastern and central regions of Saudi Arabia.
To achieve this aim, the authors collected 361 serum samples, 103 whole blood samples and 323 swabs from Al-Hasa, Dammam, Al-Jubail, Al-Qateef, Riyadh and Al-Qassim.
The results of this study demonstrate the absence of anti-AHSV antibodies in the sera of tested animals.
Furthermore, no viral nucleic acids were detected in the collected blood and swab samples, as evaluated by real-time AHSV-RT-PCR.
Moreover, all tested samples collected during 2014-2016 were negative for AHSV.
This confirms that the horse populations studied in the eastern and central regions of Saudi Arabia during 2014-2016 were AHSV free.


Abstract
Since its introduction to the Republic of Georgia in 2007, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has spread across the Caucasus region, the Russian Federation, and some Eastern European countries.
It is assumed that large populations of naïve, domestic, free-ranging and wild pigs are vital to the transmission of the disease.
In 2014, a survey was conducted across the Republic of Georgia to determine ASFV prevalence among domestic swine herds.
All 1,231 samples collected for this survey tested negative for ASF.
The probability of observing no reactors in a sample of this size (n = 1,231) from a population with an estimated disease prevalence of 1% is very low (<0.0001).


Abstract
The objective of this study is to identify the relative importance of criteria that could be used to evaluate control strategies for foot and mouth disease (FMD).
A questionnaire was distributed to 21 Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs), or their representatives, at the 28th Conference of the Regional Commission for Asia, the Far East and Oceania of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), held on 18-22 November 2013 in Cebu, the Philippines.
The CVOs/CVO representatives were present on behalf of 21 of the 31 OIE Member Countries in the region, and the questionnaire evaluated the importance of epidemiologic, economic and social- environmental criteria in the FMD control strategy decision-making process.
Finally, within the social-environmental criterion, the mental health of FMD-affected farmers was viewed as the most important indicator, with a median relative importance score of 70 (range 5-100).
The median relative importance scores of FMD-experienced countries and FMD-free countries were 80 (range 50-95) and 95 (range 40-100), respectively.


Abstract
Among these is an increase in the dispersal of pests and pathogens across the globe.
It was found that the indirect risks associated with exports may be as great as the direct risks associated with imports.
These findings may assist the targeting of disease risk mitigation activities.


Abstract
These temporally connected events may indicate a new link between climate change and an increased incidence of bacterial diseases with environmental reservoirs.


Abstract
Dogs play valuable roles in human society.
In India, the number of pet dogs is estimated to be around 5 million.
The stray dog population in India is estimated to be 19 million and still increasing, due to ineffective control measures.
Stray dogs pose substantial risks to public health due to injury and transmission of zoonoses such as rabies.
Both pet and stray dogs may act as reservoirs of zoonotic parasites in India, which has a climate conducive to the environmental survival and transmission of many zoonotic parasites.
At present, visceral larva migrans, cutaneous larva migrans and echinococcosis are the most important parasitic zoonoses in India.
Leishmaniosis, dirofilariosis, Brugia malayi infection and giardiosis are potentially significant emerging parasitic zoonoses, and theleziosis, gnathostomiosis and dipylidiosis occur sporadically.


Abstract
Bovine tropical theileriosis (Theileria annulata infection) is an important tick-borne disease in several regions of the world.
The density of nodules was estimated at 15-20 per 10 cm2; they were distributed over the animal's body and were 0.5-2 cm in diameter.
Microscopic examination of the skin nodules 18 days after treatment onset showed a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils.
Nevertheless, no schizonts were observed.
Appropriate treatment led to the recovery of one of the two animals with total disappearance of the skin lesions; the other animal died.
A review of clinical cases of tropical theileriosis (T. annulata infection) with cutaneous lesions is presented.
Various dermatological signs are described in the literature: skin nodules, haemorrhagic lesions, cutaneous gangrene, etc.
Most authors reported the presence of schizonts in the nodular lesions.
Dermatological involvement in bovine tropical theileriosis should be considered by field veterinarians and should be differentiated from other diseases with dermatological signs.


Abstract
Infection with equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disease, abortion and neurological disorders in horses.
In recent years, an increase in the number of cases of equine neurological disease caused by neuropathogenic variants of EHV-1 has been observed in numerous countries.
The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of the viral genome of EHV-1 and equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) in the bronchopulmonary lymph nodes of 47 horses from various locations in Uruguay, obtained from a slaughterhouse, and to determine whether the EHV-1 genomes possessed the mutation associated with neuropathogenesis (G2254/D752).
The genes encoding glycoprotein H (gH) of EHV-1 and glycoprotein B (gB) of EHV-4 were amplified by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction.
Of the samples analysed, 28% and 6% of lymph nodes contained the genes for gH and gB, respectively.
The viral DNA polymerase gene was amplified and sequenced.
Twelve of the 13 genomes sequenced presented the nucleotide G2254, while the remaining 1 showed both nucleotides, A2254 and G2254.
The results confirm the presence of EHV-1 in Uruguay.
Furthermore, there is evidence for the first time of the detection of EHV-4, and high-frequency detection of the neuropathogenic variant (G2254/D752) of EHV-1 in Uruguay.
These findings provide new insights into the epidemiological situation of EHV-1 and EHV-4 in that country.


Abstract
The HI results suggest equine H3N8 virus circulation among the animals tested from São Paulo State.
The algorithm suggested here could be used to guide antibody detection against equine influenza virus in equines, improving the test specificity by aiming to avoid false positive results.


Abstract
The first batch of OIE reference serum of dog origin was produced in1991 and was used internationally until the beginning of 2010.
The preparation of the new batch began in 2012 and, in contrast to the previous batch, three commercial inactivated rabies vaccines based on the most frequently used vaccine strains (Pasteur Virus and Flury Low Egg Passage) were selected for the immunisation of dogs in accordance with OIE guidelines.
In 2013, calibration was completed through an inter-laboratory test involving five OIE Reference Laboratories for Rabies with the Second World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for Anti-Rabies Immunoglobulin being used as a reference standard in this calibration.
After statistical analysis of the results, the consensus titre was established as 5.59 IU/ml.
The technical and statistical data were submitted to the OIE for assessment.
In February 2014, the OIE Biological Standards Commission adopted this serum as an OIE-approved standard reagent for rabies serology.


Abstract
In veterinary medicine, biosecurity relies on the implementation and respect of procedures that reduce the risk of the introduction and spread of pathogens.
Checklists compiling the biosecurity rules to apply in both contexts were established (31 rules were considered for the necropsy room and 35 for the slaughterhouse).
Observation s were performed by a single person to ensure standardisation.
The level of compliance with biosecurity rules was intermediate and reached 42% vs. 37% for the necropsy room and the slaughterhouse, respectively.
No significant difference was observed between these compliance rates.
Increasing staff supervision of students and increasing awareness through education should be encouraged.
The follow-up of observations through time could be used to assess the evolution of compliance with biosecurity measures.


Abstract
In addition to three original Universities of Veterinary Medicine, 23 veterinary-related universities have been established with titles such as 'Veterinary, Animal and Fishery Sciences', which do not reflect the VME programmes.
The award of Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees in Animal Husbandry (AH), Poultry Science and Dairy Technology created confusion and increased competition with veterinary graduates for positions in the dairy and poultry industries.
Some countries, including Japan and Australia, have changed from the British single degree system to the American dual degree system.
The American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education has classified the 597 VMAIs into 'accredited' (n = 49; 8.2%), 'listed' (n = 468; 78.4%) and 'unlisted' (n = 80; 13.4%) categories.
Veterinary medical professionals and international organisations must think creatively about the future of global VME, especially with regard to the standardisation of the nomenclature of institutions, degrees, professional associations and core curricula, to contribute effectively to biomedical sciences and One Health at the national and global levels.


Abstract
Rabies is a major zoonosis that affects the central nervous system of warm-blooded mammals.
The disease is present worldwide, except for some islands.
Africa and Asia record over 95% of the fatal cases of rabies worldwide, and therefore the greatest risk to human life from rabies occurs in these regions.
Mass vaccination of dogs is the most appropriate way to control and eliminate the disease at the animal source, in order to interrupt the infectious cycle of the disease from animals to humans.
Rabies is endemic in the North African region, and countries should be encouraged to develop programmes for eliminating human rabies through the implementation of sustained campaigns to immunise dogs and by providing post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to people who have been exposed to suspected rabid dogs.
In Tunisia, the national strategy against rabies was started in 1981 and it has been upgraded since.
Following the launch of the annual vaccination programme in 1993, there was a significant improvement in the health status for rabies in Tunisia, with a decrease in the number of cases in animals and humans.
Since 2011, an increase in cases of rabies in dogs and humans has been observed, due to lower vaccination coverage, mismanagement of waste and an increase in the stray dog population.
The political will at international, regional and national levels is the cornerstone of the strategy to eliminate the disease.
In the framework of the regional approach in the Maghreb, additional efforts and political willingness are necessary at the national level to better control and eventually eliminate rabies.


Abstract
Fireworks are used worldwide to celebrate national, religious, cultural festivals and holidays.
However the use of fireworks is associated with preventable injuries.
Most injuries sustained were to the hands, followed by head and neck, torso, limbs and perineum in descending order of frequency.
A total of 38.7% of patients required surgery for their wounds.
Fireworks not only result in significant burn injuries, but also eye injuries, soft tissue defects and fractures requiring a spectrum of plastic surgical interventions.
The number and severity of accidents can be minimised by raising awareness regarding safety precautions.


Abstract
Limited information exists regarding endothelial dysfunction following burn injury.
C57BL/6 mice were grouped as uninjured controls, 10% or 25% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) scald burns.
Blood and tissue sampling was performed over a specific time course.
Plasma levels of shed syndecan-1, a marker of glycocalyx damage, were quantified by ELISA.
Lung and spleen sections were stained with immunofluorescent anti-syndecan-1 antibodies to evaluate intact glycocalyx.


Abstract
Selective enzymatic debridement is increasingly being used in cases of burn wounds.


Abstract
The aim of this work was to examine aspects related to the "quality" of enzymatic debridement, which is inherently different from surgical debridement.
To this end, biopsies harvested from partial thickness burn wounds, before and after enzymatic treatment, were histologically assessed.
As is well known, surgical escharectomy removes the necrosis as well as some of its neighbouring healthy tissue, sharply and radically, leaving a perfectly clean and viable wound bed.
On the other hand, enzymatic escharolysis is more selective, as it completely wipes out the necrotic portion while sparing unharmed and partially damaged tissue.
This scaffold should be safeguarded with a view to possibly achieving a more complete and functional spontaneous tissue regeneration.
Conversely, if this dermal portion is mismanaged, it could desiccate, thus leading to the formation of a neo-eschar with unpredictable clinical evolution.


Abstract
We present a rare severe thermal/crush hand injury case where we were able to successfully treat the patient with NexoBrid enzymatic debridement-escharotomy.


Abstract
Among the many potential complications of sepsis/septic shock are hemodynamic instability and perfusion failure.
The utility of vasopressor agents in the management of septic shock depends on the balance between increased perfusion pressure and the direct effect on the microvasculature.


Abstract
The symptoms are pathological flushing and sweating with gustatory stimuli.
It most commonly occurs following parotid surgery and has not previously been reported following burn injury.
We present a 50-year-old man who sustained 1% TBSA full thickness burn to the right side of his face as a child.
This was confirmed with a starch iodine test, and successfully treated with Botulinum toxin injections post reconstruction.
This case is the first report of Frey's syndrome following burn injury.
We highlight the potential development of Frey's syndrome following facial burns, even in the reconstructed area.
Botulinum toxin treatment remains effective.


Abstract
Burn injury is considered a global health issue.
Some factors could contribute to wound healing.
In this study we assessed the effect of non-fatty omental cells in burn wound healing.
Rats in group 2 had a daily application of silver sulfadiazine; group 3 rats were injected with omental cells, and group 4 rats were injected with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) once, followed by daily application of Vaseline to the burned region.


Abstract
Management of burn patients is challenging, and requires a lot of knowledge and experience gained through research.
Porcine is the most frequently used experimental model because pig skin is anatomically and physiologically similar to human skin.
We included systematic reviews, meta analyses, and experimental studies of burns using porcine models.


Abstract
However, this use requires adjuvant treatment.
In this paper, we highlight an original effective process not yet published to optimize the tolerance of pessary.


Abstract
[Acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia in a teenager].
Pathophysiological mechanisms and etiology remain poorly understood.
It manifests as a febrile dyspnea, progressively worsening.
Chest X-ray, performed as first-line, shows bilateral infiltrates.
The chest CT confirms a diffuse infiltrative pneumopathy and the bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrates the presence of alveolar hypereosinophilia.
The exclusion of other causes of alveolar eosinophilia confirms the diagnosis.
A ventilatory support is very often necessary.
Systemic corticosteroids provides a spectacular clinical improvement, without recurrence.


Abstract
Complications of this technique are principally surgical, but hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy can result in toxic effects, especially for kidney and bone marrow.
We report the case of an ARDS developing intraoperatively during an extensive cytoreduction surgery associated to HIPEC, due to the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agents.


Abstract
Two years later the recruitment of patients in the first trials is ongoing.


Abstract
The key performance indicators in healthcare illustrate that the system we run nowadays is no longer sustainable.


Abstract
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are associated with lots of extra-intestinal complications.
Among them, venous and arterial thromboembolisms lead to high rates of morbidity and mortality.
They often occur during an IBD flare and seem to be mostly provoked by acquired factors.
Its indications have recently been upgraded to outpatients.
In this review, we describe the epidemiological and ætiological features of these manifestations, as well as their prevention and management.
Only venous thromboembolisms are considered.


Abstract
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also known as Verneuil's disease and acne inversa, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by a dysfunction of the pilosebaceous structures resulting in occlusion and inflammation.
It is a multifactorial disease with the most commonly cited risk factors or aggravating factors being smoking, obesity, and HS family history.
The first line of treatment relies on antibiotics, including tetracyclins, clindamycin and rifampycin.
In case of non-response, TNF? antagonists, more specifically adalimumab, may be considered.


Abstract
Trimbow® is the first triple therapy in spray with fixed dose and containing 3 pharmacological agents (LABA-LAMA-ICS).
Clinical trials show that Trimbow® improves numerous parameters such as the respiratory function, the quality of life, the symptoms and the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations while being tolerated well.
These results justify its use in severe and very severe COPD with exacerbations in spite of treatment by LABA-LAMA or LABA-ICS.
In this article, we present a brief synthesis of the main recent clinical trials on Trimbow®, its comparison with other pharmacological agents/associations regularly used in the treatment of COPD, as well as some practical information on its use in routine.


Abstract
The aim of this study was to review the ZI treatment plan and its surgical technique based on a series of nine edentulous atrophic maxillary cases.
Implant survival rate and postoperative follow-up were reported as well as those described in the literature.
The advantages and disadvantages of ZI versus traditional methods of rehabilitation in our daily work were also discussed.
Implant survival rate was 100% over follow-up periods varying from 5 to 47 months.
During postoperative follow-up, two patients presented with slight palate inflammation.
When the patient wishes a fixed prosthetic rehabilitation, the solution provided by the ZI becomes more common in the daily practice of the clinician.


Abstract
The zygomatic implant (ZI) is a partial or complete alternative technique to so-called traditional rehabilitation techniques (aiming to increase bone volume) of edentulous atrophic maxillae.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of fixed prosthetic rehabilitation by ZI on patients’ quality of life.
This study highlighted the level of satisfaction of nine patients treated with ZI via their pre-therapeutic and post-therapeutic scores on the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP)-14 scale.
Results about the quality of life of our patients was very satisfying.


Abstract
The aim of the study was to evaluate the molecular and histological effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on vascularisation in clinical cases of open wound treatment in dogs.
Open wounds (n=10) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: NPWT treatment (n=5) or foam treatment (polyurethane-foam dressing, n=5).
Histological slides were blinded and analysis was performed using automated histomorphometric software.
Signalment, pre-treatment time and underlying cause were similar between groups.
NPWT resulted in a highly significant increase of vascularisation (p.


Abstract
However, even then there are opportunities for mixed grazing to benefit productivity.
Semi-natural vegetation communities offer much more opportunity for selective grazing as they are generally more botanically and structurally diverse.
Examples are given of the impact of losing large and small grazers from grazed ecosystems in marginal areas.
Loss of cattle grazing from the uplands of Wales has been instrumental in the spread of invasive hill grass species linked to the loss of heathland habitats of international conservation importance.
Conversely, the loss of sheep and goats from common lands in the Cantabrian Mountains has led to the progressive expansion of woody vegetation, again at the expense of heathlands.
Such examples highlight the role that mixed grazing can play in promoting economic and environmental sustainability, particularly in marginal areas.


Abstract
More than half of the world's households are thought to contain at least one companion animal.
This paper outlines the negative implications of failing to account for animals in disaster plans and/or to accommodate them in shelters.


Abstract
Nature and nurture have created more than a living mechanism for rescue workers, however.
The emotional benefits and support provided by dogs for responders and victims alike are a profound adjunct to their work as search dogs.


Abstract
Working and service dogs are subject to illness and injury, depending on their breed characteristics, activities and the environment in which they work.
Many breeds of working dog suffer from inherited forms of musculoskeletal disease; most importantly, elbow and hip dysplasia.
The effectiveness of traditional radiographic (phenotypic) scoring schemes at reducing the prevalence of hip and elbow dysplasia has been variable.
The selection of breeding stock should preferably be based on estimated breeding values, rather than on an individual phenotypic score/grade.
Nutrition can affect physical and mental performance, disease risk and susceptibility, and recovery from injury, age-associated decline and longevity.
The dietary proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate influence fuel selection during exercise.
A common concern among farmers is the difficulty of maintaining body condition in their dogs during periods of heavy work with current feeding practices.
Additionally, maintaining a positive calcium balance is necessary for adaptive remodelling in response to exercise.
Research strategies should include improved treatment options, the development of more specific means of genetic selection for inherited diseases, investigation into specific nutritional requirements and the dissemination of this knowledge.


Abstract
Skeletal and neurological problems consistently rank among the top health conditions necessitating the withdrawal or retirement of guide dogs and other working dogs from their service roles.
Management practices such as weight management and physical conditioning may help to reduce the incidence of such conditions.
The management of single gene disorders is relatively simple through the judicious use of DNA test results.


Abstract
All genes contain two major DNA regions.
The region containing the genetic message proper (the 'coding region') is preceded by a regulatory region ('the promoter'), which determines when and in which organs a given gene must produce the corresponding protein.
The techniques of genetic engineering allow the association of the coding region from one gene with the regulatory region from another gene.
The expression of these recombinant genes may be achieved in cultured cells, in transgenic animals or in plants.
This leads to the production of the corresponding proteins, including pharmaceutical proteins.
Milk from transgenic animals is one potential source of pharmaceutical proteins.
To achieve this, the promoters from milk protein genes are bound to DNA fragments containing the coding region of the genes of interest.
The desired proteins are then taken from the milk and purified.
Two human pharmaceutical proteins are on the market and about 20 projects are in development.
One of the proteins produced in milk, antithrombin III, is an anticoagulant and the other, human C1-esterase inhibitor, is an anti-inflammatory.
Several human proteins have been produced in the egg white of transgenic chickens and one has been approved by the United States Federal Drug Administration.
This process has also been used to modify antibodies in cows.
The genes that code for antibodies in the cow were deleted and replaced by human antibody genes.
These cows, immunised by various antigens, then secreted purely human antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies from such cows were able to attenuate the effects of Ebola virus in human patients.


Abstract
With supply falling short of demand, it is foreseen that the use of porcine material may at some stage overcome the existing gap between organ availability and clinical need.
Recently, pig islet cells have been utilised in clinical trials, with safety being demonstrated.


Abstract
As a consequence, transgenic animals have had little opportunity to affect global agriculture, and only a handful of pharmaceutical applications have been successfully commercialised.
New developments in genome editing hold considerable promise for targeting traits that improve both animal health and welfare, and frequently involve no introduction of DNA sequences from other species.
Nonetheless, future global regulation and public acceptance of such methods remain uncertain.
No activity can survive a risk-only evaluation, and there are considerable opportunity costs associated with preventing breeders' access to safe technologies in order to achieve genetic improvements in livestock populations.


Abstract
The contribution of farm animals to human health and welfare cannot be properly addressed without reflecting on the impact that animal domestication has had upon human civilisation.
About 14,000 years ago, the Neolithic revolution started with the domestication of animals and plants, resulting in the emergence of the main agricultural breeds of livestock and crops.
In contrast, the breeding of new animal species for biomedical research, such as small rodents and other model species, is a relatively recent activity.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms of inheritance have only been understood over the past few decades and translated into approaches to improve breeding success.
In recent years, seminal discoveries in the fields of cellular reprogramming, genetic engineering, and whole-genome sequencing have accelerated this development.
The first therapeutic proteins produced by biopharming in livestock have been approved to treat human patients.
The suitability of pluripotent stem cells as a source for cell replacement therapies is currently being investigated, using farm animals as informative preclinical models.
Disease modelling in farm animals allows systematic testing of effective treatments.
Within the context of these developments, this concise review will focus on the contribution of farm animals to human health and welfare.


Abstract
The species used in interventions include dogs, cats, horses, rabbits, goats, hamsters and crickets.
Despite these benefits, HAIs are also associated with problems, including allergies, asthma, zoonoses, animal bites and scratches, and human falls.
Companion animal ownership is also expensive.
Inconsistent policies concerning keeping animals in housing and enabling service animals to access public places make it difficult to live with companion animals or keep service animals in some circumstances.
Additional research is needed to provide an evidence base to evaluate the efficacy of particular types of HAI using a given type of animal.
This will document specific outcomes for an individual with certain characteristics and assist in promoting the future use of HAI to enhance human and animal health and well-being.


Abstract
This review discusses the importance of red meat from ruminants as a source of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids (FAs) for human life in the context of the contribution of animals to human welfare.
Red meat is a valuable food commodity for human life because it is naturally rich in key nutrients such as protein, trace elements, vitamins and essential FAs.
In developed countries and high socio-economic groups from developing countries, red meat intake is greater than that of oily fish, owing to availability, preference and affordability.
There is mounting evidence that regular consumption of n-3 FAs is beneficial for growth and development as well as the health and welfare of humans of all ages.
The dietary background of ruminants significantly influences the concentration of n-3 FAs in red meat.
Meat from forage- or grassfed ruminants has a greater concentration of n-3 FAs than that from their feedlot or grain-fed counterparts and can also offer a favourable n-6:n-3 ratio in the meat.
Scientific literature shows that the advantages of consuming n-3 FAs enriched meat (foods) outweigh the disadvantages.


Abstract
Meat represents an important source of high-quality dietary protein for a large proportion of the global population.
In addition, red meat, in particular, significantly contributes to the intake of a wide range of micronutrients, including iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin D and vitamin B12.
Excessive consumption of meat and meat products is often associated with overconsumption of energy and fat, resulting in excess weight, obesity and an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
In addition, certain components of fresh and processed red meat may further increase the risk of these diseases and predispose the consumer to cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
In the face of population growth and global warming, there is increasing concern about the sustainability of farm animal production.


Abstract
One in five children across the globe experience stunted growth and underdevelopment due to malnutrition.
Animal-source foods (ASFs) offer the opportunity to address this problem and make significant progress towards achieving the World Health Assembly nutrition targets.
Eggs and milk are among nature's first foods, providing holistic packages of nutrients and bioactive factors to support healthy growth.
They are also affordable and accessible to lowresource, vulnerable populations.
Biological and evolutionary rationale argues for the use of ASFs during the complementary feeding period when children are most at risk from infectious diseases and malnutrition.
Dietary patterns in the evolutionary history of hominids point to the importance of ASFs for increased brain size and function.
Studies also demonstrate high bioavailability of limiting nutrients, such as vitamin A, iron, zinc and fatty acids in the ASF matrix, ensuring efficient absorption and metabolism.
The empirical evidence for intervention using eggs, milk and fish, however, remains somewhat limited.
To sustainably build systems that support equitable and adequate ASFs in the diets of all children globally, consideration should be given to microeconomic and macroeconomic factors, 'One Health', and maintaining balance in the ecosystem.
Important contributions may then be achieved through ASFs for the well-being of populations worldwide.


Abstract
Dogs provide help during rescues, companionship, and support for livelihoods.
The paper ends by emphasising the importance of local solutions for improving the health and welfare of both animals and humans.


Abstract
The genetic diversity of domesticated species is contained within breeds, with the result that conserving breeds conserves this diversity.
Breeds are predictable genetic resources that allow a match of animals with different environments and production goals.
Breeds were developed through a process involving foundation, isolation and selection.
Several breeds have undergone genetic adaptations that make them uniquely suited to specific challenging environments.


Abstract
It is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality.
Arterial hypotension can be constitutional, part of a syndrome, orthostatic, or secondary (drug induced, hypovolemia).
The first line of treatment is non-drug therapies .
The most frequently used medical treatments are midodrine, and fludrocortisone.
However specific molecules as droxidopa, pyridostigmine, erythropoietin can also sometimes be indicated.


Abstract
Some data in the literature suggest that meditation can play a role not only in stress management but also in blood pressure control and cardiovascular disease prevention.
Mechanisms involved may be based on the regulation of emotional and biological responses to stress, by regulation of the autonomous nervous system.

Nine main avenues were defined as priority projects for the institution.


Abstract
Drowning is a significant and neglected public health problem mostly affecting young children.
However, recent articles in the media describing dry drowning of children have been reported.
This entity seems to be absent of the actual scientific literature and worried parents can be reassured.
Increased vigilance is the key as prevention is the most efficient intervention to reduce drowning mortality.


Abstract
This article highlights initiatives undertaken by federal partners to address the opioid crisis in Canada.
The need for novel surveillance approaches that improve the collection and harmonization of drug-related data is also discussed.


Abstract
Timely public health surveillance is required to understand trends in opioid use and harms.


Abstract
The nature of Canada's opioid crisis necessitates additional data sources that can provide a more comprehensive picture of the epidemic, in order to provide public health officials and decision-makers with a robust evidence base.
Paramedic data provide a conduit into the community where overdoses occur.
Prehospital events and circumstances surrounding opioid-related overdoses provide unique opportunities to collect evidence that can contribute to prevention, harm reduction and health promotion efforts.
Using data extracted from the Ottawa Paramedic Service (OPS), this proof-of-concept study demonstrated that paramedic response data were useful in providing near real-time epidemiological information (person, time and place) on the opioid epidemic and in assessing trends and opportunities to develop alert triggers.
Between January and June 2017, the OPS responded to an average of four opioid-related calls each week.
On average, 0.5 mg of naloxone was administered each time.
For the study period, linear trends show a small but insignificant increase in calls (p = 0.18).
A higher volume of calls occurred between April 16 and 29, 2017.
According to local media reports, this spike in paramedic responses was due to the arrival of high-grade fentanyl in Ottawa.
With further validation, paramedic data can potentially provide a novel data source to monitor opioid-related overdoses.


Abstract
It does not appear that the opioid crisis has resulted in a disproportionately higher number of suicides in Alberta.

The following overview will summarize the various aspects of negative symptoms and discuss current diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations.


Abstract
The CGH-array (Comparative Genomic Hybridization array) makes it possible to search for chromosomal anomalies with a very high level of resolution; high throughput sequencing can detect gene abnormalities on the whole exome or on a panel of genes.
For the patient the detection of genetic anomalies aims to improve the quality of care; for related parties, genetic counseling is systematically offered.


Abstract
Despite an estimated prevalence of 800 000 patients with PAD in Canada, the burden of the disease among Indigenous Canadians is unclear.
Available evidence suggests that this population has a higher prevalence of several major risk factors associated with PAD (diabetes, smoking and kidney disease).
Little is known about the cardiovascular and limb outcomes of Indigenous peoples with PAD.


Abstract
Brain imaging technology provides a powerful tool to visualize the living human brain, provide insights into disease mechanisms, and potentially provide a tool to assist clinical decision-making.
The brain has a very specific structural substrate providing a foundation for functional information; however, most studies ignore the very interesting and complex relationships between brain structure and brain function.
While a variety of approaches have been used to study how brain structure informs function, the study of such relationships in living humans in most cases is limited to noninvasive approaches at the macroscopic scale.
Such approaches provide the benefit of allowing us to identify links which do not necessarily correspond spatially (eg, structural changes in one region related to functional changes in other regions).
They also provide a "network level" perspective on the data, by enabling us to identify sets of brain regions that covary together.
This also opens up the ability to evaluate both within and between network relationships.
A variety of examples are presented, including several showing the potential of such approaches to inform us about mental illness, particularly about schizophrenia.


Abstract
The brain is the ultimate adaptive system, a complex network organized across multiple levels of spatial and temporal resolution that is sculpted over several decades via its interactions with the environment.
Moreover, we explore how disruptions in these processes could lead to abnormal brain network architecture and organization and thereby give rise to schizophrenia.
Arguing that the neurodevelopmental trajectory leading up to the manifestation of psychosis may best be understood from the sequential trajectory of connectome formation and maturation, we propose a novel extension to the neurodevelopmental model of the illness that posits that schizophrenia is a disorder of connectome development.


Abstract
This brief review surveys some of the most commonly used and neurobiologically insightful graph measures and techniques.
Among these, the detection of network communities or modules, and the identification of central network elements that facilitate communication and signal transfer, are particularly salient.
Overall, graph theory methods are centrally important to understanding the architecture, development, and evolution of brain networks.


Abstract
Over the past decades, network neuroscience has played a fundamental role in the understanding of large-scale brain connectivity architecture.
Brains, and more generally nervous systems, can be modeled as sets of elements (neurons, assemblies, or cortical chunks) that dynamically interact through a highly structured and adaptive neurocircuitry.


Abstract
The frontoparietal network is critical for our ability to coordinate behavior in a rapid, accurate, and flexible goal-driven manner.
In this review, we outline support for the framing of the frontoparietal network as a distinct control network, in part functioning to flexibly interact with and alter other functional brain networks.
This network coordination likely occurs in a 4 Hz to 73 Hz θ/α rhythm, both during resting state and task state.
Precision mapping of individual human brains has revealed that the functional topography of the frontoparietal network is variable between individuals, underscoring the notion that group-average studies of the frontoparietal network may be obscuring important typical and atypical features.
Many forms of psychopathology implicate the frontoparietal network, such as schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Given the interindividual variability in frontoparietal network organization, clinical studies will likely benefit greatly from acquiring more individual subject data to accurately characterize resting-state networks compromised in psychopathology.


Abstract
Clinical neuroscience struggles with poor scientific validity of neuropsychiatric diagnosis and its negative impact on management.
In the absence of accurate pathological biomarkers there is a challenge in finding a solid foundation for modern neuropsychiatry.
Consequently, we have developed over the years a neuro-circuitry-based training for our psychosomatic medicine fellows.


Abstract
There is no doubt that for caregivers and patients, the train has left the station and policymakers should follow.


Abstract
Modern communication technologies have opened up new perspectives for modern medicine.
Developed and used in many countries since the 1990s, teleconsultation responds to societal change.
It facilitates communication between doctors but also between doctors and patients.
It helps to improve access to care and reduce health costs.
The studies showing its interest in practice are numerous as for example: follow-up of chronic diseases, psychiatric follow-up or post-operative follow-up in outpatient surgery, etc.
Teleconsultation is increasingly popular with patients but still encounters cultural and other obstacles by calling into question certain fundamental aspects of the doctor-patient relationship.


Abstract
These challenges demand a process of professional and cultural transition from these foreign medical doctors who constitute a real asset for the host countries.
Indeed, they participate in solving the problem of medical shortage and bring to their host country their rich professional experience and recognized clinical skills.

The atrophy assessment of the posterior cingulate cortex and the precuneus, other key hubs of the declarative memory network, can also be a useful complement.


Abstract
The approaches and tools of health promotion can be useful for civil society groups, local and national governments and multilateral organizations that are working to operationalize the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.
We highlight areas where such approaches and tools can be applied effectively and provide evidence of the transformative potential of health promotion in efforts to achieve the sustainable development goals.


Abstract
The Universal Periodic Review is a comprehensive, state-to-state peer-review mechanism of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council.
Created in 2006, the mechanism scrutinizes the human rights record of all UN Member States, including their efforts to realize the right to health.
However, the mechanism is relatively under-used in global health governance compared to treaty-based procedures, such as those overseen by the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities or the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.
We suggest that the Universal Periodic Review could be used to support the monitoring and review processes of the sustainable development goals (SDGs).
The review could offer a unique perspective for other actors on how to ensure accountability for the complex and intertwined SDGs, including their commitments for health.
We present some of the current limitations in the way health is addressed in the Universal Periodic Review.


Abstract
Corruption is diverse in its forms and embedded in health systems worldwide.
Health-sector corruption directly impedes progress towards universal health coverage by inhibiting people's access to quality health services and to safe and effective medicines, and undermining systems for financial risk protection.
Corruption is also a cross-cutting theme in the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs) which aim to improve population health, promote justice and strong institutions and advance sustainable human development.
To address health-sector corruption, we need to identify how it happens, collect evidence on its impact and develop frameworks to assess the potential risks and put in place protective measures.
We propose that the SDGs can be leveraged to develop a new approach to anti-corruption governance in the health sector.
The aim will be to address coordination across the jurisdictions of different countries and foster partnerships among stakeholders to adopt coherent policies and anti-corruption best practices at all levels.
Combating corruption requires a focused and invigorated political will, better advocacy and stronger institutions.
There is no single solution to the problem.
Nevertheless, a commitment to controlling corruption via the SDGs will better ensure the integrity of global health and human development now and beyond 2030.


Abstract
Gender refers to the social relationships between males and females in terms of their roles, behaviours, activities, attributes and opportunities, and which are based on different levels of power.
Gender interacts with, but is distinct from, the binary categories of biological sex.
In this paper we consider how gender interacts with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, including sustainable development goal (SDG) 3 and its targets for health and well-being, and the impact on health equity.
We propose a conceptual framework for understanding the interactions between gender (SDG 5) and health (SDG 3) and 13 other SDGs, which influence health outcomes.
We explore the empirical evidence for these interactions in relation to three domains of gender and health: gender as a social determinant of health; gender as a driver of health behaviours; and the gendered response of health systems.
The paper highlights the complex relationship between health and gender, and how these domains interact with the broad 2030 agenda.
Across all three domains (social determinants, health behaviours and health system), we find evidence of the links between gender, health and other SDGs.
For example, education (SDG 4) has a measurable impact on health outcomes of women and children, while decent work (SDG 8) affects the rates of occupation-related morbidity and mortality, for both men and women.
We propose concerted and collaborative actions across the interlinked SDGs to deliver health equity, health and well-being for all, as well as to enhance gender equality and women's empowerment.
These proposals are summarized in an agenda for action.


Abstract
Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development promotes the improvement of health equity, which entails ongoing monitoring of health inequalities.
The World Health Organization has developed a multistep approach to health inequality monitoring consisting of: (i) determining the scope of monitoring; (ii) obtaining data; (iii) analysing data; (iv) reporting results; and (v) implementing changes.
Technical considerations at each step have implications for the results and conclusions of monitoring and subsequent remedial actions.
This paper presents some technical considerations for developing or strengthening health inequality monitoring, with the aim of encouraging more robust, systematic and transparent practices.
We discuss key aspects of measuring health inequalities that are relevant to steps (i) and (iii).
We highlight considerations related to the selection, measurement and categorization of dimensions of health inequality, as well as disaggregation of health data and calculation of summary measures of inequality.

Abstract
The past 4 years have seen the introduction of new regimens and new drugs to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
To identify implementation trends over time, the DR-TB Working Group of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union), in collaboration with RESIST-TB, launched an online survey to Union members around the world.
Survey respondents also identified specific challenges to the introduction of shorter MDR-TB regimens and new drugs, including access to rapid diagnosis of fluoroquinolone resistance and case management.
The results of this survey are intended to help identify research and implementation gaps while highlighting the importance of global implementation of scalable regimens for the treatment of MDR-TB.


Abstract
In 1962, Pete Seeger recorded "The Ballad of Doctor Dearjohn" about Canadian Medicare and the Saskatchewan doctors' strike of the same year.
How had this New Yorker, recently relieved of a jail sentence, learned of Medicare in the distant prairie province?
And why was his song never released?
It is situated in the historiography of folk revival and the expatriate adventures of artistic Americans persecuted in the McCarthy era.


Abstract
Phytotherapy becomes increasingly popular in veterinary medicine.
Improper use and overdosage of medicinal plants can be toxic.
This decision support system is based on the available literature in the field, which after critical evaluation has been incorporated into a structured database.
This database on medicinal plant applications in animals is linked to the poisonous plant database of the University of Zurich and, for marketed preparations, to the Swiss compendium of veterinary medicinal products as well as to an index of related veterinary products.


Abstract
A significant Antibiotic-Monitoring-System is essential to analyse the use of antibiotics and to a better understanding of trends in resistance development.
In human and veterinary medicine, for example, a system based on defined daily and treatment doses (Defined Daily Dose: DDD and Defined Course Dose: DCD) is applied.
These definitions can be used to estimate the number of treatment days and treatments with antimicrobial agents in a population.
For veterinary medicine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published the European values DDDvet and DCDvet in the farm animal sector.
The aim of this study was to define Swiss daily and treatment doses (DDDch and DCDch) for the treatment of pigs and to compare them with the EMA values in order to investigate the differences between individually collected national doses and average international doses.
For the comparison, the quotient of Swiss and European values was calculated and the influence of the application form of an active substance and the number of active substances contained in a preparation was investigated.
One hundred and three veterinary preparations with 138 active substances were assigned a DDDch and DCDch value.
A comparison with EMA values was possible for 118 active substances.
The comparison showed median values of 0.91 for the daily doses and 0.90 for the treatment doses, so that the daily and treatment doses in Switzerland are lower than the corresponding EMA doses.
Both the form of application (injection solutions: 1.00; premixes: 0.76; P=0.02) and the number of active substances in the preparation (one active substance: 1.00; two active substances: 0.76; three active substances: 0.43; each P.


Abstract
The aim of the Vaccinovigilance system is the identification of adverse reactions and rare events after the use of immunological veterinary medicinal products.
The notifications were submitted primarily by marketing authorization holders (96) or veterinarians (27) and private persons (5).
As in previous years, dogs were involved in most of the adverse effects (55%), followed by cattle (18%) and swine (10%).
Unlike the previous years, significantly fewer reports were submitted on cats (8%).
The correlation between reaction and vaccination was considered probable in 43% of the - cases.

Abstract
The majority of vestibular schwannomas have a stable evolution or a progression of size.
Some publications report cases of spontaneous involution.
We report here the clinical and radiological characteristics of this type of tumor observed in 14 patients showing a spontaneous tumor involution of their vestibular schwannoma.
The results showed an incidence of 8 % with an average tumor regression of 50 %.
Functionally, a hearing loss was found in all patients, without correlation with the duration of the observational follow-up.
There are spontaneously involutive vestibular schwannomas, but tumor regression does not prevent the deterioration of hearing.
Patients should be considered as a subset of those receiving observational management.


Abstract
In such a situation, the vestibular inputs are slower than normal.
Therefore, palinopsia could result from an abnormal temporal integration of visual and vestibular informations.

Abstract
In Canada, it is challenging to find examples of positive population mental health interventions that meet scientific standards of evidence.
It is even more difficult to identify effective interventions that address health equity.
The discrepancy between standards of evidence in the health sciences, and the evidence that can be gleaned from social experiments, is not new.
Efforts to reconcile these differences show a general tendency toward controlled interventions in public health.
This article describes work undertaken in 2015 to begin to address this evidence gap.

Abstract
Most cases of infectious mononucleosis are caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii infections, although generally benign, can cause severe congenital infections.
An acute infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can also mimic infectious mononucleosis.
The interpretation of laboratory results can be impeded by cross-reactions or persistence over several months of markers of acute infection.
This article reviews the most common causes of infectious mononucleosis and their diagnosis.


Abstract
Extraspinal tuberculous arthritis is a rare entity in developed countries, mostly found in populations of migrants.
We describe a case of foot osteoarthritis in a young migrant, with an arduous diagnostic process.
The diagnosis of tuberculous arthritis, a slowly progressing infection with a low bacteriologic burden, is difficult.
It shows the value of diagnostic procedures, their limits and the need for their integration to the clinical judgement.

Not limited to morphological information, sonography more and more includes elements of functional imaging.


Abstract
For instance, PET with FDG has totally supplanted gallium-67 for the evaluation of inflammatory conditions.
The strong local relationship between neuronal activity and cerebral glucose uptake confers to PET with FDG a primordial role in neurological conditions in which structural changes are insufficient to establish a firm diagnosis.
The recent development of tracers for neuroendocrine and prostatic cancers has opened a new field of applications for PET, linked to innovative radiotherapeutic approaches.

Abstract
Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common reasons for consultation in gynecology.
The social and economic burdens are important.
Its management is not yet optimal as dysmenorrhea still affects the quality of life of many patients.
Secondary dysmenorrhea may involve the pathophysiological mechanisms of primary dysmenorrhea, but is mainly the expression of an underlying gynecological pathology.
Studies on other unconventional complementary therapies, such as ginger consumption, are very encouraging and need to be reinforced to incorporate recommendations for the management of primary dysmenorrhea.


Abstract
The ageing of the population, having access to good quality of care, will result in an increase in the prevalence of pelvic floor diseases.
Those persons, often in good general health, may experience difficulties in accepting functional pathologies, associated with loss in quality of life.
One out of 2 women will have a pelvic floor problem and 1 out of 9 will have a surgical perineal procedure before the age of 80 years.
Our role as health care professionals is to be aware of those associated pathologies and to obtain an optimal quality of care.
We try to give an overview of the different preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic options, available in a general practitioner's office.
Taking care of the pelvic floor needs to be done in a global and pluridisciplinar setting.
Referring towards specialised centres as well as the integration of the general practitioner, especially for the more complex cases, is essential.

Abstract
However, a benign leukemoid reaction should be excluded.
If there are no abnormal cells in the differential count, it will be necessary to distinguish hyperleucocytosis from myeloid origin (neutrophilies, eosinophilies, basophilies) from lymphoid origin.
In the latter case, it is the lymphocytic phenotype that will confirm the malignancy by the presence of a clone of T or B lymphocytes but also by the monomorphic appearance of lymphocytes.
In cytologically pleomorphic lymphocytosis, lymphoid reactions related to viral infections, autoimmune diseases or drug-related lymphoid reactions will be sought.
The different causes are discussed in detail.


Abstract
Thrombocytopenia is defined by a platelet level below 150 G/l.
However, the limit of 100 G/l seems more appropriate to determine which thrombocytopenia will require further investigation.
Initially, a thorough medical history should be performed as well as screening for any signs of bleeding.
After having excluded the presence of platelet aggregates, it should be determined whether thrombocytopenia is isolated or associated with other abnormalities (cytopenias, coagulation disorder, abnormal renal or liver tests).
Causes of thrombocytopenia along with the biological tests to achieve diagnosis, will be detailed in this article.
Platelet levels between 50 and 100 G/l will require investigation, without any urgency, in outpatient haematology clinic.

Other non- neoplastic diseases such as immune thrombo- penic purpura, thrombotic microangiopathies and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are still associated with HIV infection and will be discussed.


Abstract
Oral allergies to dental materials are a growing problem and remain poorly diagnosed by health professionals.
The complaints of patients with oral allergy are various and include sensations of burning or stinging of the oral mucosa, sensations of dryness of the oral cavity, or general symptoms such as headache, dyspepsia, asthenia, arthralgia, and myalgia.


Abstract
Etiologies are numerous and the subject of different classifications.

A review of treatments is then proposed.


Abstract
Neisseria meningitidis is the cause of relatively rare invasive infections, but with very important morbi-mortality.
Vaccines are already available for serogroups A, C, W, Y. A new vaccine against meningococcus B is on the Belgian market since March 2017.
The target populations are children and teenager, since it is at this age that peaks in the incidence of meningococcal disease are observed.
The development of this vaccine has been made possible by a new process named " reverse vaccinology ", which uses the complete genome sequencing of the bacterium.
Current studies focus on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, which is good for both children and teenager.
However, there are still many unknowns with this vaccine such as the duration of protection and its impact on the pharyngeal carriage.
Another difficulty lies in the extrapolation of the immunogenicity data among a population because this vaccine consists of protein antigens and we know that the expression and prevalence of these antigens may vary between different strains of meningococci.
In England, where the vaccine has been included in the vaccination calendar, beneficial effects are demonstrated on the incidence of invasive meningococcal infections.
The toxicity profile is also reassuring, only classic side effects have been observed, such as fever and local reactions.
In 2017, the High Health Council issued a favorable opinion for individual protection, without recommending at this stage a collective vaccination in Belgium.
After a review of the most recent data on this new vaccine, we will try to draw conclusions.


Abstract
Anogenital warts are induced by low-risk HPVs.
These manifestations are increasing among men, and especially in some high-risk groups as men who have sex with men (MSM).
In the Federation Wallonie-Bruxelles, the vaccine coverage reaches currently 30 % in girls and is very low in boys and men.


Abstract
Beyond its scientific and ethical competencies, a good doctor is characterized by his communication skills.
The ability to listen is fundamental.
During an interview, the physician must keep in mind a bio-psycho-social approach while being able to hear the unspeakable and inaudible.
Knowledge of patients and their relatives, which seems to be a specific knowledge for general practitioners, offers a lot of information.
Among the main sensitive topics that the clinician must identify are: intrafamily violence, domestic violence, substance abuse and anxiety-depressive disorders.
In order to improve, the practitioner can use tools such as the Calgary-Cambridge guide and techniques used in Motivational Maintenance.


Abstract
Over-medicalization is a broad concept, which also concerns the elderly patient.
Subclinical hypothyroidism and Alzheimer's disease are two examples of pitfalls in the interpretation of biological and para-clinical data that may lead to the administration of useless treatment.
Different issues are discussed to identify the causes of over-medicalization and to better prevent it.


Abstract
Breast cancer screening is a public health challenge.
Belgium has the worldwide highest age-standardized breast cancer incidence.
It ranks third in terms of specific mortality.
The causes are unclear and presumably multifactorial.
Like most European countries, Belgium has set up a screening program since 2001.
A risk-stratified screening strategy considering other well-documented risk factors (family history, breast density, and genetic variants) could lead to better results while reducing the disadvantages.
This hypothesis will be tested through the European My Personal Breast Screening (My PeBS) study, a multicenter randomized clinical trial involving 85,000 volunteers.


Abstract
Context
ual challenges and solutions to undertaking a household adolescent mental health survey in a developing country.
Recent epidemiological evidence for Lebanese adults along with the increased efforts for policy and service planning have demonstrated the importance of screening for rates of psychiatric disorders in the adolescent population.
In response to this need, the Beirut Epidemiological Investigation of the Psychological Status of Youth was conducted in a community sample to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and their correlates among adolescents.
The main aim of this report is to provide a synthesis of the research process and challenges faced in completing the first population-based mental health survey among children and adolescents in Lebanon.
This report discusses the challenges faced and the lessons learnt in conducting such a survey.
Themes discussed include working around the absence of a proper sampling framework, conducting a sound study with limited funding and the absence of a research culture.
This report presents evidence-informed recommendations for similar future surveys.
The report also establishes that a sound epidemiological survey is possible even where there are limited resources and challenging contexts such as security issues or the absence of a research culture.


Abstract
Idiopathic venous thromboembolic disease may be the first manifestation of a cancer yet undiagnosed.
Early detection of neoplasia may allow a timely management and a reduction of mortality.
However, the nature and extent of screening for hidden cancer is still debated.
The purpose of this article is to review the usefulness of occult cancer screening in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism.

Sudden death of young athletes is often the first clinical manifestation of underlying cardiac pathology.
It is defined as an unexpected natural, non traumatic and non iatrogenic event.


Abstract
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death.
Primary causes are mostly of obstetrical origin.
PPH can be worsened by secondary coagulopathy.
This is due to dilution or consumption of coagulation factors and fibrinolysis activation.
The use of tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, in the management of PPH has been proposed and practiced for several years, following evidence of its efficacy and safety in other settings, including traumatology.
The benefit of administration of TXA during PPH has recently been proved by the WOMAN study.
This review recalls the physiopathological mechanisms involved in the genesis and aggravation of PPH.
It presents the current state of knowledge on the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of tranexamic acid in PPH and summarizes the current recommendations in obstetrics.

Abstract
Cystic fibrosis has in Belgium a prevalence of 1/2.850 births, with a median age at diagnosis of 7 months according to the latest data from the Belgian registry of 2015.
In our country, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is always based on signs and symptoms of the disease.
However, because the scientific literature has largely demonstrated the benefits of neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis, it will be implemented in Belgium before the end of 2019.
The screening programme should be framed by strict quality criteria in order to obtain the best performance with the least possible inconvenience.


Abstract
Patient Blood Management (PBM) is a comprehensive hospital approach to the anemic patient or at risk of becoming anemic, aimed at protecting and optimizing the patient's blood capital and resistance.
The main aim of BPM is to combat the risk factors of anaemia, hemorrhage and blood transfusion.
PBM involves transdisciplinary collaboration ranging from pre-hospital prevention to post-hospital follow-up.
This combination of techniques and preventive actions considerably improves the medicosurgical prognosis and contributes to the drastic reduction in the use of blood transfusion.
PBM is expanding worldwide and should eventually become an evolving treatment standard.


Abstract
Realization of several surgeries is sometimes mandatory, with the use of anti-adhesive devices between interventions.
Its complex management encourages insistence on the avoidance of its risk factors.


Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate frailty by the use of the modified SEGA grid in a population aged 75 years and older.
Frailty was assessed by the modified SEGA tool.
In total between May 02, 2016 and May 08, 2017, 64 patients were included, aged 80 years ± 3.87, with a majority of women (58 %).
The mean frailty score was 6.3 ± 3.6, with an average time of 3 minutes 55 seconds ± 1.13.
The SEGAm grid had a good discriminating capacity for age (p = 0.041), comorbidities (p = 0.016), MMS (p = 0.011), presence of home helpers (p = 2.9e-05).
There was also good agreement between the obtained SEGAm score and the subjective opinion of the general practioners with a Cohen Kappa score of 0.66.
The modified SEGA grid proves to be a good tool for frailty screening for the general practitioner, allowing preventive strategies and a personalized care project to be set up for each patient.


Abstract
The measurement of proteinuria is a very simple tool to screen and manage kidney diseases.
Its predictive role is also relevant from a cardiovascular point of view.
However, the interpretation of the results is not always easy.
Some methods are measuring total proteins, whereas others are measuring more specifically albuminuria.
For all methods, pitfalls exist and will be discussed.
Lastly, we will briefly discuss the management of a patient with a new diagnosis of proteinuria (or albuminuria).


Abstract
Liraglutide is a well-known once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist that showed a cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.
Both molecules exert complementary antihyperglycaemic effects, which allows a better glucose control, both in the fasting and postprandial states.
It has a better tolerance profile, with a more favourable effect on body weight and less hypoglycaemia compared with a basal insulin and less gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with liraglutide alone.
Xultophy® is presented as a prefilled pen and is indicated in the management of type 2 diabetes not well controlled with basal insulin.
The dose of IDegLira is progressively uptitrated, starting from 16 dose steps up to a maximum of 50 dose steps per day (corresponding to 50 IU insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide).

Abstract
The objective of this study was to characterize arterial blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained by using 2 indirect methods, oscillometry and Doppler ultrasonic sphygmomanometry, in conscious goats.
Agreement between systolic BP yielded by these 2 methods was then assessed.
Sixty female dairy goats aged from 1.5 to 11.8 y (median: 5.5 y) were examined in a standing position with a cuff placed on the tail.
All goats had a severe arthritic form of caprine arthritis-encephalitis.
Three to 5 repeated measurements of each BP type were averaged for each goat and considered as a final measurement.
With oscillometry, systolic blood pressure (O-SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and mean blood pressure, as well as heart rate (HR) were measured, while only systolic blood pressure was measured with Doppler (D-SBP).


Abstract
Six healthy beagle dogs were subcutaneously administered an immunosuppressive dose of prednisolone [4 mg/kg body weight (BW)] once daily for either 2 or 3 weeks.
Serum cPLI concentration was measured before and after treatment.
Ultrasonographic examination of the pancreas and laparoscopic biopsy and histopathological examination of the right pancreatic lobe and the liver were also conducted before and after treatment.
The expression of pancreatic lipase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in the pancreas and liver was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Although the serum cPLI concentration was significantly higher on day 14 and on the day of the second laparoscopy than before treatment, it was classified as normal (≤ 200 μg/L) in 5 dogs and as abnormal (≥ 400 μg/L) in only 1 dog.
None of the 6 dogs showed clinical signs of pancreatitis during the study period.
After treatment, ultrasonographic examination of the pancreas showed no changes except for a hypoechoic pancreas in 1 dog.
Histopathological examination of the right pancreatic lobe in all dogs showed no evidence of pancreatitis after treatment.
Pancreatic lipase mRNA expression was detected in the pancreas, but not in the liver, before and after treatment.
The administration of 4 mg/kg BW per day of prednisolone for 2 or 3 weeks increased the serum cPLI concentration without clinical signs of pancreatitis, although an abnormal cPLI concentration (≥ 400 μg/L) was observed in only 1 dog.
No ultrasonographic or histological evidence of pancreatitis was observed in any of the dogs.


Abstract
Understanding such physiological changes is imperative to providing optimum care and medical treatment in mares.


Abstract
Abnormalities of the canine prostate gland, in particular, benign hyperplasia and cysts, are frequent in dogs over 5 years of age.
Treatment strategies for dogs with prostatic cysts include ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage with alcohol sclerotherapy, reduction surgery, and omentalization.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of prostatic cysts in dogs.
Ten mixed breed adult male dogs were included in the study.
Percutaneous drainage was performed prior to ultrasound-guided PRP injection with a 21G spinal needle.
The PRP dose contained half of the solution drained from the cyst.
Follow-ups were performed 6, 12, 24, and 60 d after treatment.
Ten prostatic cysts were successfully treated with PRP after the ultrasound-guided drainage of the cystic cavities.
No side effects were observed during the procedures.
After the introduction of PRP, cysts detected by ultrasound appeared hypoechoic.
On the sixth day, the hypoechoic appearance was maintained and margins were still identifiable.
At 24-day and 60-day follow-ups, cysts were no longer detectable by ultrasound.
One of the ten dogs had to be euthanized because of the presence of a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of the oral cavity (fibroblastic sarcoma) and histological examination of serial sections of the prostate gland was performed.
Histologic evaluation 1 year after treatment showed a regression of the cystic lesion injected with PRP.
The therapy, which uses PRP injection in combination with ultrasound-guided drainage, can be considered a safe and effective strategy for the treatment of prostatic cysts in dogs.


Abstract
Gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) is a life-threatening condition, suspected to result in differential tissue perfusion in different regions of the body.
Lactate is a biomarker of hypoperfusion that correlates with treatment outcomes in dogs with GDV.


Abstract
Using mouse anti-foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3B monoclonal or polyclonal anti-vesicular stomatitis virus-New Jersey (VSV-NJ) antibodies and recombinant FMDV 3ABC or VSV-NJ glycoprotein (G) antigens coated to MagPlex beads, competitive Luminex immunoassays (cLIAs) were developed for FMDV and VSV-NJ, respectively.
The cLIAs successfully detected antibodies to FMDV 3ABC and VSV-NJ G in sera from infected animals.
The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 98%, respectively for FMDV and 93% and 95.4%, respectively for VSV-NJ.
These cLIAs are potential alternatives for competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (cELISAs) and provide the opportunity for multiplexing to reduce time and the amount of serum required for testing.

Abstract
Management of pain, agitation and anxiety is crucial in critically ill patients, and has a significant impact on clinical and functional outcome.
Of all respondents, 20 (50%) were from Europe, 7 (17.5%) from North America, 6 (15%) from Africa and 12 (30%) from other regions.
The most common analgesics were opioids, mainly administered intravenously (90%).
The most commonly used sedatives were midazolam (72.5%) and propofol (55%).
62.5% stated that they prevent delirium by combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches.
However, a substantial gap between guidelines and clinical practices exist.
Efforts should be directed at creating specific burn care guidelines and enhancing the implementation of existing recommendations.

Abstract
Our study suggests that linezolid dosing at 600mg thrice a day leads to adequate pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic exposure to linezolid with a Cmin > 2mg/l in 84.6% of cases, T > MIC in about 87.5% and AUC/MIC > 100 in 61.5% of cases.
However, a high variability in linezolid serum concentrations with a substantial percentage of sub-therapeutic levels was observed in a few patients, 15% of cases.


Abstract
Keloids and hypertrophic scars represent a common complaint for plastic surgeons.
The antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been shown to inhibit fibroblast proliferation in vitro and has been used as a treatment modality for these pathologic and problematic scars.
We present a review of literature on treatment protocols, and on the efficacy and safety profile of this drug in the treatment of problematic scarring in terms of size reduction and symptom resolution.

Abstract
Spinal trauma was suspected initially but radiography and scintigraphy were unremarkable.
Due to the severity and progressive nature of the clinical signs the -gelding was subjected to euthanasia.
Post mortem examinations (computed tomography, dissection and histopathology) revealed spinal cord compression caused by a single extradural hydatid cyst (Echinococcus equinus), confirmed with PCR, at the level of the 15th thoracic vertebra.
This is the first report of a spinal hydatid cyst causing hindlimb ataxia and should therefore be considered a potential differential diagnosis for ataxia in the equine patient.


Abstract
We report blood culture results of 43 foals admitted to an equine hospital for medical or surgical disorders and determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of different antibiotics.
Eleven foals had a positive blood culture result despite prior administration of antibiotics in 10 of these animals.
MIC values above EU
CAS
T and/or CLSI breakpoints were identified in coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium.
Gram-negative isolates were less frequently identified and did not appear to exhibit increased MIC values.
This study shows that bloodstream infections in foals in Switzerland are caused by diverse bacteria including Gram-positive bacteria which exhibit resistance to several classes of antibiotics.


Abstract
Standard radiography remains an important diagnostic tool in the practice of primary care medicine.
Nevertheless, each radiological examination must be justified with a proper indication.
The conditions for high quality images and low patient radiation are well-trained staff, a sensitive imaging system, a good "diaphragm" and a quality control system.

Abstract
Biological sex and social gender jointly influence health.
Failure to take into account differences in health between women and men is an issue.
What is more, undue differences based on stereotypes can also lead to biased care.
This article illustrates the influence of sex and gender on health through clinical situations affecting various dimensions of medical care (diagnosis, investigations, treatments, prognosis).
It also gives tools and introduces a project aimed at integrating the gender dimension into the pregraduate education of medical students at the University of Lausanne.
The aim is to ensure equitable quality care between women and men, taking into account gender specificities based on unbiased scientific evidence.


Abstract
Bird watching can be an ideal activity for a physician.
By their training, doctors may be more inclined than other professionals to take the time to observe birds.
Medical studies provide basic knowledge, especially in biology and physics.
Clinical training then teaches to watch, to listen.
It also recalls the balance that the practice of observation brings to physicians.

Abstract
Today, a vast arsenal of contraceptive methods interfering at different levels of the female reproductive axis is available.
This is not the case for men for whom, until now, there is no reliable male reversible method and for whom vasectomy, condom and withdrawal are the only options available.
Despite this limited supply, more than one third of all contraceptive methods used worldwide rely on the cooperation of the male partner.
Besides developing hormonal approaches to stop sperm production, there may be attractive approaches that will interfere with sperm functions rather than production.
Sperm functions are primarily established during post-testicular maturation, with the epididymis accounting for the majority.
The purpose of this review is to present some of the promising and/or already abandoned leads that emerge from research efforts targeting the epididymis and its activities as potential means to achieve male post-meiotic contraception.


Abstract
Multiple examples from recent conflicts illustrate the potential return to high-level function of severely injured service members following medical and rehabilitative interventions.
This review addresses the goals of rehabilitation, distills hard-won lessons of the last decade of military trauma and rehabilitation, and recommends the use of a bio-psychosocial-spiritual approach to care that can be applied at all tiers of the health care system.
Questions on enabling participation in meaningful life activities include the following: Why do some patients do well and others do not?
What elements contribute to positive outcomes?
What factors relate to suboptimal results?
A bio-psychosocial-spiritual model from the rehabilitation medicine literature — the Canadian Model of Occupational Performance and Engagement — is proposed as a guide to the provision of person-centred care and the maximization of a person’s functioning posttrauma.

Abstract
The management of osteoporosis in patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be established as in general population.
In severe or terminal CKD, bone densitometry is indicated.
In ambiguous cases, bone biopsy together with quantitative histomorphometry will be necessary.
There are limited data, though, regarding the management of osteoporosis in terminal stages of CKD.


Abstract
Sleep disorders are a recurrent complaint in geriatrics.
Of multifactorial origin, they have a significant impact on health and quality of life.
However, the answer is (too) often the prescription of benzodiazepines or related-drugs (Z-pills), sedative antidepressant, or another psychotropic medication.
More recently, melatonin, valerian and, in Switzerland, clomethiazol are widely considered as effective and more suitable alternatives for aged people.
We present a systematic review of the literature on the efficacy and tolerance of these molecules, of which the main objective is to demonstrate that non-pharmacological approach must remain the first-line therapy of insomnia in geriatrics.

Abstract
Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure is essentially a ventilatory failure.
However, treatment efficacy depends on the underlying pathology, on correct timing and on patient compliance.
He also plays a role in the follow up of patients under noninvasive ventilation for the detection of clinical parameters suggesting NIV failure.


Abstract
Cognitive impairment is associated with decreased quality of life and increased mortality in the general population, but remains underestimated and poorly studied in chronic respiratory diseases despite their increased prevalence.
Different risk factors, some modifiable, could contribute to the early development of cognitive disorders in this population.
Patients with cognitive impairment need appropriate care to promote adherence to the therapeutic project.
Respiratory rehabilitation, as a multimodal intervention, seems to have a positive effect on cognitive functions.


Abstract
Respiratory tract infections represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite the progress made in their diagnosis and treatment.
C-reactive protein and procalcitonin are the most commonly used biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for respiratory tract infections.
New biomarkers show promising results for assessing the severity of infection and identifying patients at risk for complications.
However, the use of biomarkers has limitations and the diagnosis of a bacterial infection should not be based solely on the measurement of a biomarker.

Abstract
Rarely encountered in the Western countries, membranous occlusion of the inferior vena cava results from a fibrous thickening of the intima and is commonly located at the orifices of the hepatic veins.
To date, two etiopathogenic hypotheses have been formulated: the first, dealing with the embryological aspect, the second, arguing for a thrombotic origin.
Nevertheless, several studies are still underway to understand the exact physiopathological mechanism of this obstruction.
Among these studies, some suspect the predisposing role of anatomical and infectious factors.
On average, it takes 6 years between the beginning of the symptoms and the diagnosis.
The later the diagnosis is settled, the higher is the risk of encountering a hepatocellular carcinoma.
The most relevant additional examinations to visualize the membrane are the abdominal ultrasound and the cavography.
Computed tomography allows to highlight the effects of obstruction on the hepatic parenchyma.
Concerning the treatment, many studies showed that angioplasty has an excellent immediate and late efficacy.
A few surgical techniques also exist but those are less exploited because of the non invasive aspect and lower morbidity-mortality of the endovascular treatment.


Abstract
Since July 2016, diabetic patients included in the INAMI glycemic self-monitoring system in category A in Belgium can benefit from a new system for measuring the concentration of subcutaneous glucose : FreeStyle Libre® (FSL) from Abbott company.
The main advantage of this technology is that it is less invasive as it does not require finger blood sampling and allows patients to obtain, in addition to the instantaneous value of glucose concentration, retrospective kinetic data, but also prospective trend of its kinetics.
In this study, we mainly evaluated the contribution of FSL on the overall equilibration of diabetes and on the time spent in hypoglycaemia.
We also asked patients how satisfied they were with this system.
Data from 838 diabetic patients (type 1 or total insulin deficiency) were collected between May 2016 and October 2017, 645 patients with FSL system and 193 preferring to continue self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose (SBG).
In the FSL group, compared to the SBG group, there was a slight decrease in HbA1c estimated at 0.15 ± 0.073 % after 15 months.
This decrease appears mainly when the starting level is high (HbA1c superior to 7.5 %).
A higher number of scans is also associated with a decrease in the average duration of hypoglycaemia.
Finally, the satisfaction survey shows a high degree of patient satisfaction with the use of FSL.


Abstract
Exacerbations in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are critical events in the evolution of the disease.
They are generally defined by the need to be temporarily treated by systemic corticoids and/or antibiotics.


Abstract
Bone pain associated with bone marrow infiltration is often present at diagnosis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
It sometimes signs the presence of pathological fracture, lytic lesions, arthritis, or osteitis associated to ALL that can delay the diagnosis.
During treatment, bone complications (pain, osteopenia, fracture, avascular necrosis, ...) are also reported.
In order to describe bone involvement (BI) of pediatric LLA, we reviewed the records of 104 patients followed in our unit.
The overall incidence of BI was 67 %.
At diagnosis, 50 % of patients had BI and in 19 %, the diagnosis of ALL was delayed.
During and after treatment, respectively 28 % and 37 % of patients presented bone complications (pain, fractures, avascular necrosis, osteopenia).
Patients with BI had a lower leukocytosis inferior to 10x109/l (p = 0.005) and an ALL of average risk (p = 0.019).
38 % of patients with BI during treatment were over 10 years old and 55 % were girls (vs. 21 % and 38 % in the entire cohort, respectively).
Osteoporosis was more severe at diagnosis than during treatment, suggesting the presence of constitutional promoting factors.
In our cohort, the majority of BI was resolved at the end of treatment with no long-term sequelae.

Abstract
In India, 73 million people have diabetes and 3.5 million infants are born preterm.
Without timely screening, there is a risk of visual loss due to diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity in these two groups, respectively.
Both conditions are emerging causes of visual impairment in India but there is no public health programme for screening or management.
Pilot projects were initiated in 2014 to integrate the screening and management of these conditions into existing public health systems, particularly in rural communities and their referral networks.
The World Health Organization's health systems framework was used to develop the projects and strategies were developed with all stakeholders, including the government.
Both projects involved hub-and-spoke models of care units around medical schools.
For diabetic retinopathy, screening was established at primary health-care facilities and treatment was provided at district hospitals.
For retinopathy of prematurity, screening was integrated into sick newborn care units at the district level and treatment facilities were improved at the closest publically funded medical schools.
In the first two years, there were substantial improvements in awareness, screening, treatment and partnership between stakeholders, and changes in public health policy.
Advocacy within state governments was critical to the success of the initiative.


Abstract
Access to safe, effective, good-quality medicines can be compromised by poor pharmaceutical system governance.
This system is particularly vulnerable to inefficiencies and to losses from corruption, because it involves a complex mix of actors with diverse responsibilities.
A high level of transparency and accountability is critical for minimizing opportunities for fraud and leakage.
Experience with these two programmes revealed that stakeholders interpreted transparency and accountability in a range of different ways.
This article provides a conceptual understanding of how transparency can facilitate accountability for better access to medicines.
We identified three categories of information as prerequisites for accountability: (i) standards and commitments; (ii) decisions and results; and (iii) consequences and responsive actions.
Examples are provided for each.
Conceptual clarity and practical examples of the information needed to ensure accountability can help policy-makers identify the actions required to increase transparency and accountability in their pharmaceutical systems.
We also discuss factors that can hinder or facilitate the use of information to hold to account those responsible for improving access to medicines.


Abstract
Definitions for each provider level were also created to aid standardisation of providers across Africa and to help advance the practice of OHEC.


Abstract
Out-of-hospital emergency care (OHEC) should be accessible to all who require it.
However, available data suggests that there are a number of barriers to such access in Africa, mainly centred around challenges in public knowledge, perception and appropriate utilisation of OHEC.
Having reached consensus in 2013 on a two-tier system of African OHEC, the African Federation for Emergency Medicine (AFEM) OHEC Group sought to gain further consensus on the narrower subject of access to OHEC in Africa.
The objective of this paper is to report the outputs and statements arising from the AFEM OHEC access consensus meeting held in Cape Town, South Africa in April 2015.
The discussion was structured around six dimensions of access to care (i.e. awareness, availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability and acceptability) and tackled both Tier-1 (community first responder) and Tier-2 (formal prehospital services and Emergency Medical Services) OHEC systems.
In Tier-1 systems, the role of community involvement and support was emphasised, along with the importance of a first responder system acceptable to the community in which it is embedded in order to optimise access.
In Tier-2 systems, the consensus group highlighted the primacy of a single toll-free emergency number, matching of Emergency Medical Services resource demand and availability through appropriate planning and the cost-free nature of Tier-2 emergency care, amongst other factors that impact accessibility.
Much work is still needed in prioritising the steps and clarifying the tools and metrics that would enable the ideal of optimal access to OHEC in Africa.

Abstract
The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is defined by euvolemic hyponatremia due to an inappropriate retention of free water under the effect of antidiuretic hormone.
It is underdiagnosed despite well-defined criteria.
Diagnosis involves a precise evaluation of volemia and the elimination of differential diagnoses.
Fluid restriction is the recommended first-line treatment for mild or moderate hyponatremia.
However, only the etiologic treatment leads to the disappearance of SIADH.


Abstract
The hospital discharge letter is an important tool for transmitting medical information during the transition from inpatient to outpatient care.
It promotes continuity of care, as well as quality and safety of medical care.
Nevertheless, several challenges exist within a university hospital department that may make it difficult to transmit these documents in a timely manner.
In this article we describe a project to improve the quality and rapidity of the transmission of discharge letters in our internal medicine department, composed of organizational and formative measures.


Abstract
We report a case in the department of internal medicine and endocrinology of the hospital of MALI.
This was a 14-year old girl who consulted for stunting and puberty.
She presented clinically a dysmorphic syndrome, TANNER stage1 secondary sexual characteristics, weight and height at -3 DS and a bone age estimated to 9½ years old on the X-ray of the hand.
The hormonal assessment showed an elevation of FSH and LH and the genetic study showed an iso chromosome Xq.
This result was part of a Turner syndrome with Xq iso chromosome.

Abstract
Although they include benign lesions, most are renal cell carcinomas.
A radiological assessment, associated if necessary with a percutaneous renal biopsy, leads to their diagnosis in the vast majority of cases.
Minimally invasive partial nephrectomy has become the standard surgical technique in specialized centers.
Ablative therapies (radiofrequency and cryotherapy) and active surveillance are other possible therapeutic approaches.


Abstract
[Ambulatory surgery in urology].


Abstract
In this review article, we refer to recent publications dealing with the indication to pressure-volume and pressure-flow studies using cystometry as well as the indication for antibioprophylaxis prior to these examinations.
We conclude that despite various indications these examinations must be reserved for complex cases after exhaustive preliminary evaluation.
Moreover, in case of complex urinary incontinence or neurogenic bladder videocystomanometry is recommended for a correct and complete diagnosis.
In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer considered as necessary before these examinations, including for neurological patients.


Abstract
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complaint, both in the general medicine and the urology out-patient clinic.
The quite recent availability of effective treatments has profoundly changed the perception of sexual health in society, which has become more demanding.
We should see erectile or sexual function as a health marker.
Its causes are often diverse but we can classify them as somatic (vascular, neurological, endocrine, tissue-related, iatrogenic) or psychogenic.
Management should be etiological if possible.
It often goes first by reducing cardiovascular risk factors and then by prescribing a vasodilating agent functioning through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5.
When modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are identified, we refer the patient to a specialized consultation.
ED is to be seen as a warning sign of a preventable disease or cardiovascular event.


Abstract
Despite widespread recognition of the issue, there is very little in the way of evidence to guide policy and programming to improve transitions.
Transition support workers have been identified as a promising intervention to facilitate successful transitions, and innovative programs involving transition workers are currently operating in the Canadian mental health sector.
This commentary presents two case studies of existing transition worker programs in the Greater Toronto Area that link hospital and community mental health sectors for youth ages 12-18.
We discuss program characteristics, the transition worker role, recommendations to organizations considering creating a similar service, and areas for future research.
The goal of this commentary is to contribute to knowledge exchange and ultimately strengthen the evidence base for the transition worker role in child and adolescent mental health services.


Abstract
In most countries, the demand for integrated care for people with chronic diseases is increasing as the population ages.
This demand requires a fundamental shift of health-care systems towards more integrated service delivery models.
To achieve this shift in China, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Chinese government proposed a tiered health-care delivery system in accordance with a people-centred integrated care model.
The approach was pioneered in Luohu district of Shenzhen city from 2015 to 2017 as a template for practice.
In September 2017, China's health ministry introduced this approach to people-centred integrated care to the entire country.
We describe the features of the Luohu model in relation to the core action areas and implementation strategies proposed and we summarize data from an evaluation of the first two years of the programme.
We discuss the challenges faced during implementation and the lessons learnt from it for other health-care systems.
We consider how to improve collaboration between institutions, how to change the population's behaviour about using community health services as the first point of contact and how to manage resources effectively to avoid budget deficits.
Finally, we outline next steps of the Luohu model and its potential application to strengthen health care in other urban health-care systems.

Abstract
Diaphragm disorders in adults.
Diaphragm diseases, functional particularly, are little known and often underestimated by clinicians.
Whether a fortuitous discovery on a chest x-ray showing an elevation of the hemidiaphragm or revealed by dyspnea, these abnormalities of the diaphragm require further investigations.
The objective is to confirm the diagnosis, understanding the mechanism, to clarify the functional consequences and to consider treatment.
Some dysfunctions may be temporary, contraindicating any emergency treatment apart from acute ruptures.
Only symptomatic cases require a surgical treatment.
The type of surgery depends on the cause and can range from simple repair of a diaphragmatic defect, diaphragm plication to restore tensioning and even phrenic pacing in very rare cases.


Abstract
Wounded soldier pre hospital covering: the forward medicalisation.
This forward medicalisation is based on the experiences of anterior conflicts and modern medical technical evolution.
It works around combat casualties care, declined in three competences levels.
Under enemy fire, each soldier is capable of implementing first combat casualties care level.
A second level corresponds for producing of rescue technical acts by specifically trained personals, until the arrival of a medical staff witch is most of the time a doctor and a nurse.


Abstract
Hospital care for war casualties: forward surgery.
War casualties in today's conflicts are often multiple injuries although fatal injuries of the trunk is limited by the use of ballistic protection.
The initial surgical treatment is performed on the theater of operations.
The definitive treatment will be done once the patient resuscitated, stabilized and sometimes after evacuation.


Abstract
Rehabilitation after a war injury.
Combat wounds can be the cause of serious physical and mental trauma.
Injuries caused by the explosion of improvised devices are responsible for multiple penetrating injuries, limb amputations, brain or spinal-cord injuries, and sometimes severe burns.
The performance of protective equipment and the effectiveness of the initial medical care allow those injured to survive, often at the cost of severely compromised functional prognoses.
Following critical and surgical care, the multidisciplinary teams of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM et R) intervene with the wounded to initiate rehabilitation and assist with social and occupational reintegration.
This support takes place in two steps: the primary phase of "acute rehabilitation" is aimed at preventing and treating complications and starting to relearn activities of daily living; the second phase of "rehabilitation-reintegration" encompasses both the medical and social fields.
The implementation of individualized rehabilitation requires the collaboration of PM et R and psychiatric teams, along with various officials within the military institution.
New processes specific to the military environment and adapted to the war wounded have been developed: the creation of the War Wounded Rehabilitation and Reintegration Unit (C2RBO: Cellule de Réadaptation et Réinsertion des Blessés en Opération); the use of new technologies and funding of bionic prostheses for amputees; the development of sports rehabilitation programs; the creation of tools to promote social and family reintegration; and the improved recognition of and compensation for injuries.
In parallel, the care connection has been reorganized to create a "Defense Rehabilitation Pole" underpinned by a territorial network ensuring the implementation of a care course for every injured soldier, from the initial care in the Parisian military hospital complex to the military medical centers closer to the forces.

Abstract
How to recognize and report a work accident or an occupational disease.
The notion of occupational risk has been introduced into French regulation in the late nineteenth century.
Since then, French workers have the opportunity to receive specific benefits for accidents and diseases attributable to their professional activity.
In 2014, 4% of employees affiliated to the general social security scheme were affected by a work accident or an occupational disease.
However these figures are underestimated because of under-declarations.
This lack of declarations relates both to employers, victims and health professionals.
Concerning physicians, inadequacy of information on the modalities and possibilities of declarations is often involved.
The author aims to provide a synthesis and practical tools for physicians, so they can provide the best support and information to their patients.
The procedures of recognition and declaration are presented according to the different mandatory insurance schemes.

Abstract
Postpartum depression.
Its main differential diagnosis is the postpartum blues.
It represents a major public health issue.
Its prevention requires a better understanding of its determinants, which allows an early and targeted action on women who are most at risk.
Once diagnosed, a collegial management is required to avoid the impact on the mother and child.
Psychotherapy and/or antidepressant therapy may be necessary.


Abstract
Early postpartum discharges: the care pathway.
A care pathway for these patients is well defined.
If those conditions are met, it must be ensured that the relay is organized at home.
This relay aims to the mother's accompaniment, the evaluation of her psychosocial and family situations at home, as well as, medical monitoring and screening for maternal or infant morbidity factors.
It is carried out with city health professionals and through perinatal networks.
Particular specifications must be respected and specific parameters need to be monitored.


Abstract
Public health surveillance: what is it?
Public health surveillance aims to describe a population health event to estimate its burden based on its characteristics (incidence, prevalence, survival and mortality) and their evolutions.
This monitoring helps to contribute to the definition, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health policies.
It must also be able to alert with the emergence of unexpected health phenomena.
These two approaches are highly complementary.
The contribution of these information systems (and of the health professionals who have to fill them out) is essential to the development of public health policies.

Abstract
Use of inhaled treatments in acute viral bronchiolitis in infants.
Even if they need to be better studied in atopic infants, beta-2 agonists have no effect, excepted side effects.
Anticholinergic drugs are not recommended.
Adrenaline, despite some positive effects, is not recommended too.
Ribavirine, an antiviral agent, is reserved to very precise indications.
At all, in 2016, any inhaled treatment is recommended for treating acute viral bronchiolitis in infants..


Abstract
Risk of persistent asthma following infant bronchiolitis.
Repetition of wheezing episodes during early childhood is a risk factor of persistent asthma during childhood, adolescence and young adulthood.
Host constitutional factors contribute both to the occurrence of the first wheezing episodes and of their persistence.
These factors play a particularly important role in prenatal airway growth.
Postnatal factors, inflammatory or environmental, interact with these constitutional factors to modulate the airway caliber and the level of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
A vicious circle is created between persistent symptoms and lung functional alterations that may predispose in the long term to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Violent behaviors during sleep.
Violent behaviors during sleep are probably underdiagnosed but frequent and disabling complaints.
After awakening, the subjects are often unaware of their actions and had partial or complete amnesia of the episode.
The violent behaviors during sleep may have multiple aetiologies.
The parasomnias, including the disorders of arousal and the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder are mainly involved.
This article provides a brief overview of the epidemiology, the diagnosis, the prognosis and the treatment of the main causes of violent behaviors during sleep.


Abstract
Research for novel antivirals: where are we going?
Several other molecules are used in clinical practice against herpesviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, papillomaviruses and influenza viruses.
Most nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir and nucleotide analogs such as cidofovir, require phosphorylation prior to inhibit the activity of DNA or RNA polymerases through mechanisms of competition and optionally termination.
Foscarnet, a pyrophosphate analog, makes this inhibition directly without any modification.
Antiretrovirals also include protease, integrase and entry inhibitors while the neuraminidase inhibitors have proven to be effective against influenza viruses.
Research for novel drugs aims at increasing the number and specificity of antivirals to overcome the current limitations of antiviral chemotherapy which include the inability to eradicate latent viral infections, emergence of resistance, adverse effects related to cell toxicity and cost.
It is essential that economic imperatives do not block or distort the expected progresses in this particularly innovative field of contemporary medicine.


Abstract
Definition, classification and prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic lymphoid leukaemia is characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of mature lymphocytes with or without tumoral syndrome.
It is the malignant blood disease most frequent in Occident characterized by a monoclonal lymphocytary proliferation > 5 000/mm3 over one duration higher than 3 months.
The prognostic classification of this pathology is at the same time clinical resting on the stage of Binet but also biological.
It is very heterogeneous character in term of clinical and biological presentation, but especially of evolution in fact an enthralling and complex pathology with a major current challenge: that to define prognostic factors allowing to establish an evolutionary risk.


Abstract
Therapeutic indications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries, while it is rare in Asia.
It is defined by the presence of more than 5 G/L of B cell clonal.
If its evolution is very heterogeneous, the treatment required in the active forms of the disease, progressive stages A and B and stage C of the classification of Binet, benefited in recent years of considerable progress.
We consider in this paper the treatment of CLL front line and in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R), with or without inactivation of TP53: deletion or del(17p) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene.
We will discuss the place of immunochemotherapy, including the choice of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies: rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab.
For BCR inhibitors, we will limit to the most mature drugs that have obtained marketing authorization: inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) ibrutinib and phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) delta, idelalisib.
Given its impact, research inactivation of TP53 should be performed before each line of therapy, his presence modifying therapeutic strategies.
The treatments, if properly codified, must consider the often little known side effects, whose management is complex.

Abstract
Multiple sclerosis patient's support.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory chronic pathology of the central nervous system, and the second cause of acquired disability for young adults.
It requires a multidisciplinary care coordinated between specialists and allied health professionals.
A close collaboration is needed between the various patricians, especially between the neurologist and the general practitioner.


Abstract
New treatments and strategy in multiple sclerosis.
Currently, ten drugs are approved for the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Since 2007, 4 new disease-modifying therapies (DMT) have been approved and several DMT will soon be commercialized including new galenic forms of self-injectable DMTs (pegylated interferon beta 1a and glatiramer acetate).
Although these self-injectable DMT have moderate efficacy they have proved to be safe on long term and able to delay disability progression and the entry in the secondary progressive phase of the disease.
Some of the new DMT have similar efficacy to the first DMT, other are more efficient but carry the risk of serious adverse events.
We report the efficacy and safety of these new drugs in reference to their pivotal study.
The current therapeutic strategy is sequential: a first DMT is initiated, then in case of intolerance or failure an other DMT with a different mode of action or second line DMT is proposed.
Others strategies may be proposed according to the patient's evolution such as an induction by an aggressive immunotherapy followed by a maintenance with a first line DMT.
Whatever the strategy used the most important goal is to reach a shared decison between the patient and his or her neurologist which guarantee the best adherence to DMTs.


Abstract
Legionellosis.
Leginellosis is an important cause of community- acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
In France and in Europe, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1(Lp1) is the causative agent in most cases.
The incidence of the disease is underestimated.
The main risk factors are age, underlying debilitating conditions, and immunosuppression.
This is an "atypical" pneumonia that might clinically ressemble to other bacterial pneumonias and is often severe enough to require hospital admission.
Urinary antigen detection is the first-line diagnostic test, although it is limited to Lp1.
Sample culture of the lower respiratory tract is recommended since it enables the diagnosis of all legionella spp and outbreak investigation.
Disease notification is required.

Abstract
Managing the atherosclerotic arterial disease.
Peripheral arterial disease is currently detected by measuring the ratio of the systolic pressures between the ankle and at the arm (ABI).
It is a powerful marker of cardiovascular mortality.
Arterial doppler ultrasound is the imaging test to perform in first intention for a morphological and hemodynamic assessment of the lesions.
The management is based on prevention of cardiovascular mortality, obtained by the control of risk factors and the use of antiplatelet agents, statins and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.
A supervised walking training is useful at the stage of intermittent claudication to reduce functional disability.
Revascularization should be considered systematically at the stage of critical ischemia, due to the major risk of amputation at this stage.
In case of intermittent claudication, the risk of amputation is low and revascularization can be considered in the presence of aorto- iliac lesions or in case of persistent functional disability, despite the medical treatment and rehabilitation.

Abstract
The incidence of lung cancer in France is estimated 39 495 cases in 2012.
Lung cancer is thus the second cancer in men after prostate cancer, and the third after breast cancer and colorectal cancer in women.
The main risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco-smoking, alongside genetic, occupational, and professional causes.
Diagnosis is made at a metastatic stage for more than half of the patients, with limited survival despite treatment.
Conversely, when diagnosed at an early stage, lung cancer is eligible to surgical resection, leading to a survival of more than 85% at 5 years.


Abstract
Clinical signs that must lead a clinician to suspect lung cancer are non-specific, but are often linked to the appearance or modification of a respiratory or general symptom.
Therapeutic strategy depends on the distinction between small-cell and non-smallcell lung cancer, and on tumoral extension.
In the case of a localized carcinoma, the determinant item for therapeutic decision is operability.
In spite of therapeutic advances (targeted therapies, immunotherapy), the treatment of the majority of patients relies on chemotherapy.

Abstract
Epidemiology of age-related macular degeneration.
The epidemiological studies conducted in the last 30 years have allowed the estimation of the prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on the different continents, and the identification of its main risk factors.
Thus, the prevalence of AMD increases strongly with age and is more frequent in populations of European ancestry than in those of African ancestry, with an intermediate situation in Asians and Hispanics.
More than 50 genetic polymorphisms have been identified as associated with AMD, including 2 major associations with the complement factor H (CFH) and ARMS2 genes.
Smoking is a major risk factor, with a 5-fold increased risk in heavy smokers.
Finally, the role of nutrition (in particular intakes of antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin and omega 3 fatty acids) appears important.
The major role played by modifiable factors (in particular smoking and nutrition) opens the way to preventive strategies.


Abstract
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degeneration of the central area of the retina that allows detailed vision.
This area called the macula is responsible for the discrimination of high spatial frequencies (reading), color vision and central visual field.
The loss of visual acuity secondary to the occurrence of AMD causes a significant impairment for the patient quality of life.
From an early form, causing no or little visual harm to patients, AMD can progress to 2 late forms: atrophic form, which progresses slowly, and exudative or neovascular form of more rapid evolution.
It seems important to achieve early detection of this disease in order to promote management that will fight against its progression.
The use of multimodal imaging can meet these screening criteria and perform personalized follow-up of AMD patients.

Factors and clinical forms of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults.
Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD) is a common complaint.
Risk factors for GERD are hiatal hernia and obesity.
Complications of GERD are oesophagitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, peptic stricture or Barrett's oesophagus.


Abstract
Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is a common disease that can however impair quality of life.
A baseline esophageal manometry is recommended in the preoperative assessment for GERD surgery.


Abstract
The high frequency of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and the symptoms variability should lead to propose graduate treatments that have in common lifestyle modifications and postural measures.
First-line drugs are antacids and it is only in case of inefficiency that in second- line anti-secretory treatment is used.
This therapeutic strategy is effective in over 90% of cases.
These treatments do not change the volume of reflux but only its wounding power.
Surgical approach for laparoscopic fundoplication is discussed in case of significant anatomical abnormalities or regurgitations.
Endoscopic treatment is restricted to clinical trials.

Abstract
Scientific integrity: code of conduct and failure.
Scientific integrity is the practice with integrity and honesty that must prevail in any research and its dissemination.
We must distinguish scientific integrity (rules governing the practice of research) from the research ethics (issues related to advances in science and their societal impact).
In medicine, fraud can have deleterious consequences affecting directly on patients.
For clinical trials, good clinical practices are intended to help investigators.
Conflicts of interest are integrity violations if they are neither declared nor managed.
To speak of scientific misconduct, it is necessary that there is intent to deceive, whether considered mistakes - wrongly - as venial (embellishment data), or characterized serious misconduct.
The error in science is not scientific misconduct to the extent that it is consubstantial with the approach of the researcher.
There is a continuum between the methodological ignorance, questionable research practices and fraud.
The pressure on publication to a request for research funds or obtaining a recruitment or promotion, the promotion of a clinical study or drug trial,... are causes promoting integrity violations.
Students, post-doctoral students, supervisors and senior researchers, all may one day either deflect, cross the yellow line of scientific integrity.


Abstract
Scientific integrity: the french proposals to implement the national charter.
Breaches of scientific integrity have been underestimated or ignored and not treated by research organizations and universities.
Since 1999, Inserm has set up a delegation in scientific integrity.
The Second World Conference on Research Integrity in Singapore in July 2010, defined the principles and recommendations on scientific integrity.
In 2011, a "European code 'of conduct for research integrity was published for the European scientific community.
In July 2014, the CNRS has published a guide "Promoting research integrity and responsibility".
A national charter of deontology of the research profession was signed in January 2015 by public research organizations.
The Secretary of State for Higher Education and Research requested in 2016 a report entitled "Review and proposals to implement the national charter of deontology".
The main proposals are based on an explicit recognition of this problem, the appointment of a "scientific integrity" referent in institutions, to coordinate the information and training policy on scientific integrity, and handle allegations of misconduct.
A network of these referents should coordinate these actions.
The report recommends the creation of a national structure, tentatively named the French Office of Scientific Integrity.
A new approach to science was born with digital sciences.
Scientific integrity is consubstantial with the opening of science to all.

Abstract
Liver cysts and abcesses.
Liver cysts are common lesions and present in around 5% of the population.
Their diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and imaging, mostly ultrasound and computed-tomography- scan.
Magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced ultrasound are useful in order to characterize complex or atypical cystic lesions.
The simple hepatic cyst is the most common lesion; it is always benign and is usually asymptomatic.
It does justify neither monitoring nor treatment.
The other cystic lesions of the liver are of infectious origin: the hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus and frequent in endemic areas, and hepatic abscesses that include pyogenic and amebic abscesses.
Overall, less than 5% of cystic liver lesions are malignant.

Abstract
Specific features of childhood-onset inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incidence of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel diseases (PIBD) is increasing in developed countries for several decades.
Pediatric-onset of the disease is a factor of severity, due to a higher activity and a longer evolution of the disease.
Biological therapies may be used as first-line therapy in severe cases, or in case of failure of thiopurines.
In mild to moderate forms of UC, salicylates retain an important role while the use of thiopurines or biological should be considered in severe forms of disease.
The use of surgery is sometimes required, usually earlier in PIBD than in adult IBD patients.

Abstract
Haemophilia: how sentinel patients have developed warning semiotics.
The experience of the disease may help the patient to develop effective actions to manage every day, if it is accompanied by a personal reflection.
Following a process that sometimes can be long, some people with hemophilia, called sentinel patients have developed a personal semiology of early and subclinical signs of hemarthrose, complementary to medical semiology.
Learning such an approach can be made possible within therapeutic education workshops co-facilitated by patient/parent and caregiver resources.
This collaborative work between patients and caregivers also brings benefits to professionals who, for some, consider differently the care they provide to people they meet in their healthcare activity.


Abstract
Vaccination in childhood in France : current issues and challenges.
Children are a priority target for immunization programs, in large part because the most contagious vaccine- preventable diseases affect children early in life.
If vaccination coverage of infants is very high and consistent with public health objectives, the situation regarding older children and especially adolescents is unsatisfactory.
Vaccination coverage against measles and meningococcal C diseases are insufficient, resulting in the occurrence of severe cases, which could have been avoided through better immunization coverage.
In adolescents, coverage against hepatitis B and especially papillomavirus are far below the expectation, exposing young adults to contamination by these oncogenic viruses.
General practitioners and pediatricians are the cornerstone to increase vaccination coverage.
The renewed commitment for the vaccination program of the Ministry of Health and its agencies should give them the support they need, in particular by providing them with tools tailored to their practice.


Abstract
Food allergy in children, when evoke ?
What tests ?
Food allergy is an adverse reaction to food proteins by immunological mechanisms (IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated).
Signs can affect many organs, but skin and digestive symptoms remain the predominant manifestations in children.
Some allergens are responsible for most food allergies in children.


Abstract
The definition of anaphylaxis cannot be limited to shock.
In practice, the rapid onset of clinical manifestations reaching two systems, after consumption of a suspect food is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis.


Abstract
How reintroduce food in an allergic child.
Many food allergies heal when the child grows.
The management is very different, if the allergy recognizes a non-IgE-mediated mechanism or IgE-mediated.
In case of food allergy with non-IgE mediated mechanism reintroduction can sometimes be gradual at home.
If the allergy persists over time, oral immunotherapy is an important change in the food allergy treatment paradigm.
However, to date, the recommendations advise against the practice outside of research protocols.
Two exceptions are discussed: some allergies not IgE mediated and egg or cow's milk cooked immunotherapy.


Abstract
Skin complications of obesity.
Obesity is associated with a number of skin lesions.
It modifies the skin-acting hormones, temperature regulation, skin pressure, immunity and veno-lymphatic vascular systems.
The acanthosis nigricans is the most common dermatologic manifestation.
Obesity increases the incidence of fungal and bacterial skin infections (abscesses, erysipelas).
Necrotizing fasciitis are rarer.
Leg ulcers, lymphedema, hyperkeratosis of heel and stretch marks are more common in the obese subjects.
Recent studies have shown in obese patients association or exacerbation of some diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and suppurative hidradenitis.
However local or general treatments are often necessary.


Abstract
Leptospirosis.
Leptospirosis is the first worldwide anthropozoonosis with an incidence of 1 000 000 cases per year.
In France, the most exposed people are athletes in fresh water (canoeing, rafting, caving...) and agricultural workers.
The peak incidence occurs in late summer.
After transcutaneous or mucosal penetration, Leptospira can cause direct tissue injury by invasion, or indirect injury by toxinic and/or immunological mechanism.
Biology can show thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, cholestasis, elevated liver enzymes, renal failure, hematuria and proteinuria.
Mortality occurs very rarely if organ failures (renal failure, pulmonary edema lesions ...) are undertaken by adequate therapy.
The diagnosis is usually based on serology (micro-agglutination test), repeated 15 days after the first test.
A first negative serology is not sufficient to rule out the diagnosis.
PCR detection is also available and can facilitate the diagnosis of leptospirosis.
A vaccine is available but it only protects against serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae.
It is recommended for professional expositions, but there is no consensus for leisure activities.

If surgery is needed, preliminary complete evaluation is needed.


Abstract
New management of fecal incontinence.
Medications are crucial and improve majority of the patients?
Surgical approach is definitely limited to patients that remain uncompletely satisfied despite optimal medical management.
Rectopxy, sphincterorraphy, neuromodulation, antegrade colonic enemas are the main surgical strategies.
Finally, stoma remains an option after failure of different strategies.


Abstract
Costs Of Cancer Care.
The increase in the cost of the therapeutic means and in the number of patients becoming chronically ill thanks to progress in the global care lead to having to take the economic elements into account.
All items of expenditure, all costs must be considered.
In 2012, the cancer has mobilized 10% of health insurance expenditure, or 14.5 billion euros.
Regarding drugs, their price is based on expert assessment of their therapeutic and medico-economic contribution, followed by a demanding negotiation between representatives of the administration and the industry.
The French system intends to defend both solidarity and equity in access to care, on the basis of rigorous analysis.
It remains up to the doctors then to make fair use of the means thus available at their disposal.

Abstract
Epidemiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motorneuron disease.
The incidence of ALS in France is 2.5/100 000 persons-years of follow-up, or 1,500 cases per year.
The peak incidence is between 65 and 75 years.
The prevalence of ALS is 8/100 000, or 6 000 cases in France with a sex ratio close to 1.
The average survival time is close to 36 months after the onset of symptoms, with a large variation between patients.
The main prognostic factors are the age of onset, initial site of involvement, the time to diagnosis, respiratory status and nutritional status.
5 to 10% of cases are family related to a mutation of the four major genes SOD1, FUS, TARDP and C9ORF72.
In sporadic forms an interaction between a genetic susceptibility factor and an environmental factor is suspected.
There is to date no association between exogenous risk factor for sporadic ALS occurrence of which could be demonstrated reproducibly with the notable exception of smoking.

Abstract
Pruritus of the elderly Pruritus of the elderly.
Pruritus is defined as an unpleasant sensation that causes the need for scratching.
In the elderly, it is frequently encountered.
Many etiologies are then possible.
Finally, pruritus is often idiopathic; this is called senile pruritus because it is probably related to aging.


Abstract
Bullous pemphigoid is the most common autoimmune bullous disease and affects almost exclusively the elderly.
Its occurrence is related to the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies directed against structural proteins (BP180 and BP230) of the protein adhesion complex of the dermo-epidermal junction: the hemi-desmosome.
Bullous pemphigoid is classically characterized by pruritus and the appearance of blisters on an inflammatory background with a symmetrical topography: thighs, arms and trunk.
Blisters eventually break, leading to erosions.
Mucosal involvement is rare.
Histology of a cutaneous biopsy finds a subepidermal blister containing eosinophils.
Direct immunofluorescence confirms the diagnosis by the presence of linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the epidermal basement membrane.
The reference treatment is the superpotent topical corticosteroid therapy (clobetasol propionate).


Abstract
Actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma in the elderly.
The increase in life expectancy and the change in the habits of the population with respect to UV exposure have led to an increase in the incidence of actinic keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
There is no specific recommendation for the "frail" elderly, but they would not differ much from the recommendations of the younger subjects.
AK are common: 1 in 3 men and 1 in 5 women after 70 years.
In the absence of treatment, the AK can evolve towards a SCC, justifying the interest of a systematic and early management of the AK by cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen), dynamic phototherapy, cream containing 5-fluorouracil (5(FU), imiquimod or ingenuous mebutate.
Incidence of SCC is also important in the elderly and especially in mans.
It can be localized on skin or mucosa.
There are forms of SCC in situ or Bowen disease, cutaneous or mucosal, accessible to cryotherapy, 5-FU, imiquimod or dynamic phototherapy as an alternative to surgery.
Most often active treatment will be considered and surgical excision is the standard treatment.
For inoperable SCC radiotherapy and radiochemotherapy are sometimes proposed.


Abstract
Epilepsy surgery
It has developed over the last few decades through better identification of candidates, advances in imaging and surgical techniques.
Main indications are temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis, low-grade glial tumors and focal cortical dysplasia.
Pre-surgical assessment is based on clinical, neurophysiological and imaging data which most often allow to carry the surgical indication.
A neuropsychological and psychiatric assessment is essential to investigate the comorbidities and evaluate the risk of post-operative decompensation.
Intracerebral exploration using stereotactic implanted electrodes (stereo-electroencephalography) may be necessary to identify the epileptogenic zone and define the surgical strategy.
Resection surgery (corticectomy or lesionectomy) is the most common procedure.
Seizure-free outcome is obtained in 60-80% of patients after surgery, with a low morbidity.
These results are maintained over the long term and associated by an improvement in the quality of life and a reduction in the costs of the disease.
Best results are observed in young subjects with short epilepsy duration.


Abstract
Cholera Cholera.
Cholera has already caused seven pandemics since the beginning of the 19th century; the seventh started from Indonesia in 1961 and was provoked by the emergence of an epidemic clone, V. cholerae O1 El Tor.
Most cases occure in South Asia, Africa, Haiti and most recently Yemen.
Contamination is by ingestion, due to close contact with a patient, or by contaminated water and food.
Patients present with acute watery diarrhea and vomiting as a result of the toxin-induced fluid intestinal leakage.
The severity of dehydration determines the prognosis, which can be fatal in a few hours if intense rehydration is not started immediately.
Prevention is based on universal access to water, sanitation and hand hygiene.
An oral vaccine can help prevent or control epidemics.

Abstract
Principles and challenges of law n° 2016-87 of 2 february 2016 creating new rights for the sick and the end-of-life.
This law reinforces and modifies the rights of patient.
Medical doctor has to respect them except three situations: a vital emergency, an unappropriated character or a redaction which is not conform to the patient's medical situation.
Advance directives have no limited duration.
They can be written in concordance with a model elaborated by the French high health authority.
They should be included in the shared medical record.
Medical doctors are encouraged to help the patient in the writing of his advance directives.


Abstract
In his daily professional practice, the family doctor already has the relationship tools to ask the patients those questions.
The patients are actually waiting for the physician's initiative on those topics.
It can be quite benficial to use the already existing helpful tools.
The doctor must trust himself and find the right moment to converse with the patient and welcome his words.


Abstract
When and how to provide a palliative sedation in terminally ill patients?
With the introduction in the French law of sedatives practices, the professionals in palliative care are obliged to define the concepts, to name the difference kinds of sedations, to elaborate guidelines for good practice.
French society of palliative care has worked to clarify the vocabulary, and to differentiate palliative sedations to their duration, their depth and the patient's consent (typology SEDAPALL).
Its guidelines of 2010 have been updated in the form of three reference sheets in conjunction with a continuous deep sedation until death: how to estimate that the vital prognosis is short term?
How to evaluate the refractory suffering?
What are the guidelines for the pharmacological administration?
The French National Authority for Health has produced a guide titled "How to realise a continuous deep sedation until death?"
The present paper highlights some fundamental points of necessary steps: listening, understanding and analysing the suffering; the collegiate procedure - multi professional deliberative process, the pharmacological administration.

Abstract
Changing epidemiology of meningococcal disease Changing epidemiology of meningococcal disease.
The epidemiology of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is characterized by a marked variation in incidence and serogroup distribution by geographical region and over time.
Immunization programs against serogroups A, C, W, Y in adolescents in North America or mass vaccination campaigns against serogroup A in Sub-Saharan Africa reduced the disease burden in these affected areas.
In Europe, immunization against serogroup C in several countries has been successful in reducing incidence through direct and indirect effect.
In France, surveillance of IMD is based on mandatory notification and strain genetic characterization at the National reference Center for meningococci.
The rates of vaccination coverage for serogroup C vaccines remain insufficient, particularly among adolescents, to induce herd immunity.

Meningococcal vaccines in france.
In France in 2015, several vaccines against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are available: non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines (bivalent AC and tetravalent ACYW135) conjugate vaccines (monovalent A monovalent C and quadrivalent ACYW135) and a novel multicomponent meningococcal B vaccine.
Currently in France, universal vaccination against serogroup C meningococcal disease is recommended for all infants at the age of 12 months with catch up till the age of 24 years.
Despite recommendations, vaccination coverage remains below recommended levels in most of the targeted populations.


Abstract
Scoliosis in adulthood : a constant evolution.
Scoliosis are increasing after the end of growth.
The average rate of worsening is one degree per year for a scoliosis beyond 30°.
Well tolered during young adulthood, the scoliosis become symptomatic over 40 years with back pain, radiculalgia, aesthaetic and functionnal discomfort.
Severe form could lead to respiratory insufficency.
Adolescents and young adults, after surgery, have, most often, a normal life.
Neurological complications, severe and exceptional shall be discussed.
Over 50 years, the rate of surgical complications increase with long fusion often required and a less robust bone.
The knowledge of scoliosis natural evolution and studies about long term surgical results allow the choice between medical treatment and surgery.
To establish a prognosis, scoliosis over 20° should be monitored with X-rays, each five years.


Abstract
Chikungunya: an expanding epidemic that now threatens Europe.
Chikungunya virus, transmitted by Aedes mosquito bites, belongs to the Arbovirus group.
During the acute phase of the infection, symptoms typically associate fever and arthralgia, but lethal complications can occur in patients with comorbidities.
More than one third of the patients suffer from chronic, sometimes invalidating, arthralgia.
Several dozens of imported cases are diagnosed each year in metropolitan France.
The geographical extension of Aedes vectors, and especially Aedes albopictus in Southern Europe and France since 2004 had led authorities to implement a specific epidemiological surveillance, in order to prevent viral autochthonous transmission.

Abstract
Should we prescribe statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular risk?
About half of cardiovascular events occur among people in primary prevention.
The challenge of primary prevention is to identify high cardiovascular risk patients in whom a statin treatment will prevent a major cardiovascular event.


Abstract
Should we prescribe statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular risk?
Drug therapy could be frequently avoided.
So the cost of the statin treatment is directly lower.
The two, statins and lifestyle, are complementary, but the second must be the first.
We have to convince everyone.

Pregnancy and lactation in women with epilepsy.
The establishment of prospective pregnancy registries in the late 1990s provided reliable and complementary information on the teratogenicity of antiepileptic drugs.
Antiepileptic therapy increases the risk of fetal malformations significantly, specifically certain molecules as sodium valproate.
The choice of antiepileptic treatment during pregnancy remains individual according to our current knowledge and to the patient by always weighing the pros and cons between the risk of fetal malformation and that of exacerbation of epilepsy.

In case of common lomboradicular pain, is it a disc herniation, osteoarthritis, or lumbar spinal stenosis?


Abstract
Therapeutic management of nerve root pain in the lower limbs.
The treatment of sciatica by disc herniation is foremost, apart from emergencies, conservative treatment.
This should start quickly to prevent chronicity of pain.
If strict rest is no longer recommended, the lifestyle and dietary rules can be proposed.
The consensual drug treatment based on analgesics and NSAID.
Systemic steroids do not provide a major bene- fit and have considerable side effects.
The epidural steroid injections are proposed after failure of non-invasive medical treatment.
These can be carried out according to different procedures and require certain precautions in view of serious accidents described.
New avenues are being explored including use of anti TNF or by percutaneous techniques.


Abstract
It is indicated in emergency in specific situations: in case of cauda equina syndrome, motor deficit lower or equal to 3/5 or hyperalgic radicular pain resistant to maximal medical therapy, including opioid drugs.
In these situations, there is no place for percutaneous treatment techniques; treatment is surgical.
Except these emergency situations, a definitive treatment is indicated in case of ineffectiveness of complete medical treatment for at least six weeks.
The objective is the treatment of radicular pain; the effect on the associated low back pain is unpredictable.
In this context of functional surgery, patient selection is very important.
At present standard treatment remains minimal invasive discectomy.


Abstract
Reemergence of plague.
Plague was one of the most devastating diseases of human history until vaccination and antibiotic therapy considerably reduced the number of cases.
Nowadays plague tends to be considered a disease of ancient times.
However the disease has never disappeared and persists in its animal reservoir.
Natural endemic foci still remain in three continents and other foci that were considered cleared of plague re-emerge.
Plague importation may also occur everywhere in the world.
The two main clinical forms are the bubonic plague and the pneumonic plague.
A prompt clinical diagnosis is essential.

Abstract
Early post stroke rehabilitation care.
Stroke represent the leading cause of non-traumatic disability in France.
Post stroke rehabilitation should be considered as soon as clinical state patient is stabilized.
In addition to early primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention, specific evaluation of neuro-motor, neuro-orthopedic, cognitive, sensory and psychological impairments is necessary.
It allows adopting the appropriate rehabilitation strategies for rehabilitation to reduce disability, acquire maximum independence and assure well-being and a satisfactory sustainable quality of life.
The organization of this care is multidisciplinary.
A coordinated care pathway optimizes therapeutic means available for reducing post-stroke disability.

Abstract
News in erectile dysfunction.
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most commonly treated sexual disorder affecting up to 20% of all men.
As ED adversely affects the lives of millions of men, the public health implications of this condition are significant and represent a challenge for our healthcare system.
Several options are available for treating ED : oral pharmacotherapy with phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors represent so far the first-line option for many patients with ED.
They are effective in three quarters of patients, with a similar response rate with the 4 available molecules (sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil and avanafil).
Recently, an alprostadil cream (Vitaros) combining the active molecule with a skin enhancer has been allowed for usage in France.
Low systemic adverse effects (3%), together with a high efficacy (up to 83%) make it a possible first-line therapeutic option for patients with ED who are reluctant to take systemic treatments.
The intra-cavernous injections of alprostadil, the vacuum, and ultimately the penile implant (reserved for ED refractory to other treatments) remain effective therapeutic options that must be discussed with the patient.
Other therapeutic options are currently under investigation, such as low-intensity shockwave lithotripsy, dopaminergic and melanocortin receptor agonists, which target central erectogenic pathways, soluble guanylate cyclases, rho-kinase inhibitors, and maxi-k channel activators that act peripherally.
Newer formulations of existing medications, such as alprostadil and PDE5 inhibitors are also developed.
Finally, stem cell regenerative techniques and gene therapy are promising new approaches to the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
Most of these novel drugs have yet to reach Phase III studies.
However, it is likely that in years to come, patients will be selectively treated with these novel agents as a monotherapy or in combination with others acting in a synergistic manner.


Abstract
Cosmetic surgery of the penis.
There is no consensus on the size below which it is justifiable to accept or attempt to modify the size of the penis.
Length of the penis under 10 cm in erection can be considered as an acceptable limit, in a patient who suffers from it.
The assessment of men asking for penile enlargement must include a psycho-sexological looking for a dysmorphophobia or another psychiatric condition.
In case of failure, three techniques can be used alone or in combination: penile lengthening by section of the suspensory ligaments and suprapubic skin advancement, lipectomy of Mons pubis and scrotal webbing section.
The results are modest, the rate of complications significant and satisfaction low.
Girth enlargement techniques by injection of autologous fat, give inconsistent aesthetic results and satisfaction rates are low.
All other techniques remain experimental.
Cosmetic surgery of the penis is associated with a high risk of forensic exposure and surgery should be only proposed after a multidisciplinary consensus, followed by a time of reflection given to the patient after full and realistic disclosure.
Applications for the purpose of reconstruction surgery after trauma or consequences of cancer treatment are justified.


Abstract
Lapeyronie's disease.
Its pathophysiology is still controversial.
Medical treatments are ineffective.
Intralesional Clostridium Histolyticum collagenase is the first non surgical option that allows a curvature improvement.
Surgery should be proposed when the curvature is stabilized and responsible for a sexual handicap.
Penile implant must be proposed to patients when erectile dysfunction is combined with severe curvature.


Abstract
Priapism.
Priapism is a therapeutical emergency for 2 major reasons: the risk of cavernous acute ischemia specific to acute venous priapism by far the most frequent, and to avoid the erectile sequels by treating before the 24th hour.
The physiopathological diagnosis and the etiological check-up are two mandatory steps for the treatment.
In the majority of cases, the clinical step easily differentiates between the arterial or venous (acute or not) type.
Major progress, the treatment must be always progressive and adapted to both (arterial and venous) mechanism and anoxic suffering explaining the cavernous blood gas role.
In case of venous acute priapism, the medical treatment, always efficient before the 24th hour, has reduced the surgery only indicated for patients consulting too late.

Abstract
Epidemiology of thyroid cancer.
There is an important increase in the frequency of thyroid cancer in France, even after taking into account population increase and aging.
This increase is essentially due to overdiagnosis.
The greater frequency of thyroid cancer among women is therefore the consequence of their more frequent interactions with clinicians at a younger age, for themself or for their children.


Abstract
Classification of thyroid cancer of follicular origin.
The 2017-WHO histological classification individualizes 4 groups of differentiated thyroid cancer of follicular origin: papillary the most frequent with several subtypes, follicular, oncocytic and poorly differentiated.
This histological classification is closely related to genomic abnormalities found in these cancers.


Abstract
Treatment of differentlated thyroid cancers.
Surgery is the first - and sometimes the only - treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers.
Following initial surgery the administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) is not systematic due to the absence of demonstrated benefits on overall survival or on disease-free survival in most patients.
Indications for RAI are based on the risk of post-operative persistent disease or relapse during further follow-up.
This risk is based on the pathology of the thyroid cancer and on the results of post-operative neck ultrasonography and thyroglobulin levels.
In the absence of prospective randomized studies on the utility of RAI, indications and administration modalities can vary from one center to another.


Abstract
Advanced thyroid cancer of follicular origin.
Advanced thyroid cancer of follicular origin is infrequent.
They are responsible for the majority of the 400 thyroid cancer related deaths that occur each year in France.
They should be referred to a multidisciplinary team in a specialized center.
Oral treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors have transformed their outcome.


Abstract
From occupational medicine to occupational health: evolution of the concepts, what current approach?
The evolution of occupational medicine since 1946 shows the evolution of health at work consideration both in the companies and in the society.
Directed at first towards an insurance-related approach, she becomes more and more an actor of prevention within health policies.
The implementation of the multidisciplinary teams and the recent laws consolidate the major role of "health at work" in primary prevention.


Abstract
Epidemiology of liver Cirrhosis.
The prevalence of cirrhosis is estimated between 0.3% and 0.6% of the general adult population, which represents 200 000 to 400 000 cases in France.
This affection is responsible for 55 000 hospital stays per year, ie about 15% of the activity of the French digestive departments and of 8 000 annual deaths.
Despite the decrease in alcohol consumption in France and the effective control of viral hepatitis B and C, an increased incidence of cirrhosis is expected in industrialized countries in parallel with the epidemic of obesity and diabetes.
Non-invasive fibrosis tests, particularly Fibroscan, are very effective in screening for extensive hepatic fibrosis.
Applied to at-risk patients, these tests may allow for the early diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and probably improve patient survival.


Abstract
Management and surveillance of compensated Cirrhosis.
Patients with compensated cirrhosis are now identified early using non-invasive fibrosis tests.
Finally, management of comorbidities frequently encountered in these patients, is also key in their follow-up.


Abstract
Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
Prevalence is 1% in Europe.
A multi modal approach is advocated for treatment of inflammation with antibiotics and biologics.
Adjuvant care for metabolic syndrom, overweight, smoking is also recommended.


Abstract
Optimal vision is mandatory for safe driving.
A sufficient visual function is mandatory to obtain a driver's license, with specific criteria depending on the type of the vehicle and the drivers's occupation.
The Decree of 18 December 2015 amending the Decree of 21 December 2005 sets out a list of medical conditions incompatible with a driving license or which may lead to the issuance of driving licenses for a limited period of validity.
Every driver must constantly be in both condition and position to perform all the required maneuvers without delay.
The occurrence of different ophthalmological conditions throughout life is a key parameter to be considered when improving road safety.
New generation driving simulators and the development of autonomous cars may improve road safety without limiting the autonomy even if the use is only scheduled for 2030.

Abstract
Ebola, the day after A total of 28,616 cases (confirmed, probable, and suspected) and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from March 2014 to June 2016.
At first, the clinical picture dominated by severe gastroenteritis baffled clinicians trained to diagnose viral hæmorrhagic fever based on bleeding.
And there was another problem: samples had to be sent abroad for laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis.
From the start, the outbreak elicited strong reactions in the different social strata and within public and private institutions, their scope extending far beyond the mere biological dimension of the phenomenon.
By the summer of 2014, the winds of panic were blowing.
Public health recommendations were issued, in authoritarian fashion, to the population, in some cases prompting a violent response.
Accustomed to locally-confined Ebola outbreaks causing a few dozen deaths in several months, the world discovered forecast models that, in one case, suggested the possibility of a million cases with half a million deaths.
Though it did not get to that point, by the late 2015 there were over 215,000 people needing to be monitored due to contact with a patient.
Clinicians had no rapid diagnostic test that could be used in their consultations to deal with the situation.
No antiviral drugs had proven effective, and symptomatic and palliative treatments were limited by the care providers' fear of infection.
There are no data proving that such treatments reduced the death rate.
The impact of public health measures on the course of the outbreak at the population level is also unclear.
Despite this rather bleak picture, early trials of a vaccine against the Zaire strain suggest that the response to such outbreaks will soon be more effective.


Abstract
Definitions and epidemiology of insomnia Complaints of poor sleep are numerous and frequent in the general population.
One of the most important is insomnia.
As it is a subjective complaint, it can be difficult to define and diagnose.
Various nosologies propose a common definition even if no consensus has yet been reached.
Insomnia may be associated to or be the consequence of various psychiatric and somatic comorbidities.


Abstract
Lifestyle and behaviors are assessed (meals, sporting activity, type of activity before and at bedtime, regularity of schedules, working hours).
Comorbidities are evaluated : depression, anxiety, restless legs syndrome, sleep apnea, somatic diseases, medication.
Simple tools are used to complete this assessment : questionnaire of sleep assessment and its disorders, sleep schedule, possibly actimetry.


Abstract
Management of insomnia : drug approach The prescription of a hypnotic can be proposed in transient acute insomnia, but only for a short period and in this indication only.
The gold standard treatment for this disorder is cognitive and behavioral therapy.
The prescription of a hypnotic should not be trivialized and is part of a short-term strategy.
In the long term, hypnotics have poor effect on sleep duration, have side effects (excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired memory or attention, risk of falls and accidents), and have a high risk of dependence.
The modalities of discontinuation of hypnotic treatments are to be anticipated with the patient as soon as the prescription is initiated.
The discontinuation will be done by a gradual decrease of the doses to avoid a rebound effect at the end of the 4 weeks of prescriptions.
In the context of chronic consumption of hypnotics, a strategy of discontinuation has to be proposed at any request for renewal of hypnotics.
The decision must be discussed and considered with the patient during a shared decision-making process.
Implementation requires precise evaluation of the severity of insomnia, the presence of a hypnotic dependence and the presence of a comorbid psychiatric disorder.


Abstract
Family empowerment, an alternative to guardianship.
Introduced on 1 January 2016, the family empowerment remains unknown to the general public as well as health professionals.
Simpler in implementation and in day-to-day management, family empowerment can be an alternative to guardianship.
Although family empowerment has many advantages, it has one major disadvantage: the absence of control of the acts performed by the agent.
The opening of a family empowerment measure requires good understanding and benevolence among all members of the family.


Abstract
Retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma is the most frequent malignant intraocular tumour of childhood.
It is a rare disease occurring in very young children.
It is a genetic disease due to the mutation of the RB1gene.
The two main presenting signs of retinoblastoma are leukocoria and strabismus.
Every suspicion of leukocoria requires prompt fundus examination.

HIV primary infection is a critical time in terms of the risk of contagion of the partners.


Abstract
Birth of evidence-based medicine.


Abstract
Evidence-based medicine : basic principles.
The practice of EBM involves five steps.
The fourth step combines the evidence with the clinical judgment and patient's values and preferences.
Once the exercise is completed for a specific patient, the fifth step consists in rating one's performance to keep updated.
Clinical questions can be formulated in 4 main areas of case management: diagnosis, treatment, prognostic or etiology.
This article presents an example in the area of treatment.
The EBM approach is important for the development of practitionners' abilities to find, critically appraise and incorporate the best scientific evidence for the benefit of their patients.


Abstract
Cancer medicines: reasons for anger.
The recent emergence of innovative therapeutics in oncology parallels growing concerns about their soaring prices.
In this context, physicians, civil society and patients are increasingly supporting transparency in a fair process of drug pricing.


Abstract
Aetiological diagnosis is not always easily established during initial visit.
When an abscess is suspected, antibiotherapy will not cure the patient, and may expose to occurrence of septic complications.
Haemorrhoidal thrombosis is another frequent aetiology of acute pain.
Pain associated with anal fissure is typicaly ryhthmed by stool passage.
For non healing fissures, surgery may be proposed.
Fecaloma, trauma, herpes virus infection and foreign body are less frequent, and clinical context is often suggestive.


Abstract
Management of anorectal bleeding.
Anorectal bleeding is a common reason for consultation in general medical practice.
The ano-rectal origin is suspected on the characteristics of the bleeding which is often scant and bright red color.
Medical history and clinical examination alone are often sufficient to make a diagnosis, since the main causes are hemorrhoids and anal fissure.
Colonoscopy is therefore necessary at the slightest diagnostic doubt and, anyway, in all patients aged over 45 years.


Abstract
Signs of severity of acute bronchiolitis in the infant.
About 3% of infants suffering from bronchiolitis will need hospitalization.


Abstract
Various etiologies can lead to ALTE, most often benign.
The investigation is mainly based on history and clinical examination.
Some very rare cases may be really severe, and even responsible of sudden death.
Some simple and non-invasive complementary tests allow to diagnose them.
Hospitalization is recommended in most cases.
The classic and common causes include gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive apneas, viral infections, convulsive equivalents.
Child abuse (shaken baby, fractures, Munchausen syndrome by proxy) can be with such a clinical picture.

Abstract
Epidemiology and prevention of health care associated infections.
Nosocomial infections (NI) are infections contracted in a healthcare facility.
This definition has become unsuited to current care practices where initially the distinguishing criterion was the place of acquisition of infection (nosocomial versus community).
It has therefore been updated in November 2007 and was integrated more broadly within healthcare associated infections.
The prevalence of nosocomial infections (NI) in France is located in the lower limits of other countries in Europe around 5.3%.
The most frequent infections are urinary tract infections, pneumonia, surgical site infection and bloodstream infection.
These NI are favored by the presence of invasive devices or invasive procedures.
Bacteria represent the most frequently microorganisms isolated in NI.
The most commonly involved are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The major problem of these bacteria is the multidrug resistance (eg, S. aureus resistant to methicillin).
NI prevention is based on greater respect for hygiene precautions.
The NI remains a public health major concern both in terms of morbidity and mortality cost.


Abstract
Prudent antibiotic use in response to the antimicrobial resistance challenges.
Appropriate antimicrobial use and hospital infection control are the two pillars on which control of antimicrobial resistance relies.
Local epidemiology is also important to consider, especially in high-risk units.


Abstract
Hospital care: from ordinary ill-treatment to « ordinary beneficence ».
Hospitality can be defined as that virtue by which a hospital institution lays the foundations for a person-centered medicine.
Indeed, this concept recognizes the patient as a host who is welcomed as a person, i.e. an individual, unique, both rational and irrational, endowed with a psychological continuity that allows him/her to make the narration of his/her life, whose complexity is not only biomedical, but also psychological, social and cultural.
In addition, the concept of hospitality is based on an essentially symmetrical and reciprocal relationship between the two hosts, the one who welcomes and the one who is welcomed.
This reciprocity allows to compensate for the inevitably asymmetrical nature of the patient-physician relationship of which one of the subjects, the patient, is also the object, giving to the other (the caregiver) the power.
In a hospital institution, hospitality can also be defined as the antonym of indifference, that leads too often to the occurrence of what has been described as "ordinary ill-treatment", which could transform paradoxically the hospital into "a world without mercy".
The French hospital institution Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris proposed recently to consider hospitality as a principle, to the same extent than quality and safety, and to evaluate its implementation.
This strategy promotes the advent in the hospital of what can be described as an "ordinary beneficence.


Abstract
How to perform a gynecological examination in the girl ?
Parents should be present in order to establish a climate of trust.
The most suitable position is that of "the frog".
The use of MEOPA (nitrogen monoxide-oxygen mixture) is valuable.
The main reasons for consultation are vulvitis, leucorrhea and genital haemorrhage.
Complementary examinations are rarely indicated, particularly bacteriological samples which are painful and usually unnecessary.


Abstract
Management of premature breast or pubic hair development in young girls
Precocious puberty is defined in girls as the development of sexual characteristics before the age of 8 years.
Each precocious development (breast or pubic or axillary hair) arises different questions if it is isolated.
In the girls, the breast development between 2 and 8 years is secondary to an idiopathic central precocious puberty in the majority of cases.
This distinction is based on the clinical features, biological and pelvic ultrasound if necessary, and on the follow.


Abstract
This justifies an early multidisciplinary care and careful psychological support.


Abstract
Skin manifestations during pregnancy are common and diversified.
Physiological changes are the most frequently reported.
Specific dermatoses of pregnancy include polymorphic eruptions of pregnancy, atopic eczema of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis and pemphigoid gestationis.


Abstract
Chest pain is the main symptom of pericarditis.
Long-term follow-up of idiopathic pericarditis is essential to improve the knowledge and the management of these patients.


Abstract
The aetiology is still uncertain.
The clinical presentation is similar to that of other etiologies of heart failure.
Echocardiography shows the presence of systolic heart failure and helps to monitor the evolution of the CPMP.
The basic treatment is symptomatic.
New therapeutic perspectives (bromocriptine, immunosuppressant) are being evaluated.
Cardiogenic shock and thromboembolic events are the main complications.
The risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is not negligible so regular follow-up is essential.

Abstract
Thymic tumors Thymic tumors.
Thymic epithelial tumors are rare malignancies, that may be aggressive and difficult to treat, with variable prognosis.
The histopathological classification distinguishes two major tumor types: thymomas and thymic carcinomas.
Autoimmune manifestations are observed in nearly one third of patients at diagnosis; myasthenia gravis is the most common, followed by pure red cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Assessing the resectability of the tumor represents the first stage of the therapeutic strategy, as complete resection is the most significant prognostic factor on patient survival.
For unresectable thymic tumors, treatment is then based on induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection or radiotherapy.
Following a call of the French National Cancer Institute, a network of expert centers for the management of thymic malignancies started in in 2012: RYTHMIC.

This treatment significantly improves weight loss, obesity related comorbidities, but also quality of life and life expectancy.
Unfortunately, there is no "ideal" procedure for a specific patient.
The surgical procedure must be safe and efficient, and its choice depends of the surgeon's experience and the patient's choice.
To date, the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass remains the gold standard treatment for morbid obesity.

Abstract
The objective of the present study was to investigate reliability of transrectal three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-S) for antral follicle count (AFC) in dairy cows.
Furthermore individual differences of AFC between cows and the fluctuation of AFC within and between different cycles were evaluated.
To evaluate cyclic follicle dynamics, six cows were repeatedly examined with 3D-S over a period of two cycles.
Using 3D-S, follicles with a mean diameter greater than 2 mm could be recorded.


Abstract
This study shows how farms can be successfully managed without using antimicrobials for udder diseases.
The operating data analysed in this study was collected during feeding and milking time on 18 swiss dairy farms that have not been treating diseased udders with antibiotics for at least 3 years.
This study is a cross-sectional study.


Abstract
The frequency of abnormal ultrasonographic findings ranged from 4 to 88%.


Abstract
The following case report describes the clinical and diagnostic procedure for suspected brucellosis infection in a dog.
A 21 month old intact male Border Collie was presented with an enlarged right testicle and epididymis.
The dog was imported to Switzerland from Germany at the age of three months, but was never abroad since then.
Clinical and laboratory diagnostic investigation included bacteriology and histology.
An initial serological evaluation by means of rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT) was negative.
Repeated examination of the same serum by a chromatographic immunoassay (ICT) revealed a positive result.
Brucella canis infection was confirmed by culture.
The present case is intended to underline the importance of the suspected diagnosis of 'brucellosis' in the presence of reproductive tract problems in dogs.
In addition, Brucella canis has zoonotic potential and it is imperative to comply with strict hygiene management.

Abstract
Despite a decreasing incidence, gastric cancer remains a burden.
Generally discovered at an advanced stage, survival improved with progress in perioperative treatment and surgical management.
Preoperative staging is essential to accurately classify the tumor and introduce the appropriate treatment.
Tumor location is particularly important because the treatment of tumors of the esophageal junction and the stomach is different.
Minimally invasive techniques can probably reduce postoperative morbidity and help to put patients in the best possible conditions for adjuvant treatment.

Asthma treatment management strategies.
Assessing asthma control is therefore a key step of the management.

Abstract
Difficult to treat or severe asthma?
Thus, difficult-to-treat asthma must be distinguished from severe asthma, which one is defined by an « intrinsic » resistance to asthma therapy.


Abstract
Erysipelas.
Erysipelas is a non-necrotizing acute dermohypodermitis of streptococcal origin (group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus) that usually affects adults and tends to reoccur.
Risk factors recognized by the 2000 Consensus Conference are lymphedema, the existence of a gateway and obesity.
Diagnosis is clinical with a classic presentation in the form of a "big red painful leg, acute, febrile and unilateral".
Necrotizing fasciitis is the main differential diagnosis, as initial presentation of both may sometimes be similar, but whose severity requires urgent medical and surgical management.
Management of erysipelas can be done on an outpatient basis or require hospitalization when parenteral treatment and/or close monitoring is required.
Recommended treatment is antibiotherapy with penicillin or macrolides or related in case of allergy, associated with lesions related to skin infection (edema, bubbles) and risk factors (portal of entry and lymphedema) management.


Abstract
Iodine deficiency during pregnancy.
Iodine is a necessary element to thyroid hormones synthesis, and is essential in neurological development.
Iodine needs increases during pregnancy.
In developed countries, iodine deficiency is the second cause of mental delay avoidable after foetal alcoholization syndrome.
In France, there is a moderate iodine deficiency, according to World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds.
The marker used in studies is 24h urinary iodine excretion, but this marker is not applicable at the individual level.
European substitution policy is hard to establish considering alimentary customs for each population.
Salt fortification has a limited impact because its use has to be limited during pregnancy.
Prophylaxis is recommended systematically by WHO in moderate deficiency areas like in France: 150 μg/ day for women of childbearing-age and 250 μg/ day during pregnancy and breast feeding.
Side effects may seem bearable considering benefit/ risk ratio providing not exceeding 500 μg/day.

Abstract
Evidence-based medicine criticism.


Abstract
Clinical inertia, or the defeat of evidence - based medicine.
Often doctors do not follow good practice guidelines that have been widely disseminated, that they know and even approve.
But sometimes this is not the case, and this is referred to as clinical inertia.
This phenomenon, recently described, seems to defeat evidence-based medicine (EBM).
The aim of this article is to propose that it is at least in part caused by a difference in logic: the purely rational logic of EBM, and the complex thought of patients and doctors, which combines rationality and irrationality, linked to the presence in the mental functioning of human beings of rapid circuits of reasoning called heuristics and of emotions.


Abstract
An example of clinical controversy related to EBM.
The DCCT study for type 1 diabetes (1993) and UKPDS for type 2 (1998) had demonstrated the benefit of the hypoglycemic treatment with, for 1 point of HbA1c less, 30% less microangiopathy events.
The cardiovascular benefit was less obvious, as these studies were performed in patients with primary prevention.
The benefit became significant only during the follow-up, 10 years after the end of the study.
After these results, it became unethical to consider randomized studies in which patients in the control group would have HbA1c greater than or equal to 8%.
More recent studies in type 2 diabetics with a very high cardiovascular risk therefore compared "intensive" treatment to "good" treatment.
The "super intensive" treatment of the ACCORD study, with an objective of HbA1c lower than 6%, resulted in increased mortality leading to premature discontinuation of the study.
The excess cardiovascular mortality was correlated with the occurrence of very severe hypoglycaemia, three times more frequent in the "super intensive" group.
In contrast to the concept "the lower is the better", patients with high cardiovascular risk should avoid the risk of severe hypoglycaemia secondary to treatment.
In addition, the drug industry was asked to demonstrate the cardiovascular safety of the new antidiabetic molecules, regardless of their hypoglycemic effect, by conducting randomized double-blind studies with an identical target of HbA1c between the two groups.
The adaptation of glycemic targets to cardiovascular risk in case of risk of hypoglycemia on the one hand, and the poor understanding of the methodology of cardiovascular safety studies on the other hand, have led to a radical questioning of the benefit of treating hyperglycemia with potentially serious consequences for patients.


Abstract
Alternatives to evidence based medecine.
The evolution of patient-physician relationships, in addition to beneficence, implies to consider patient's autonomy as a relevant ethical factor.
This infers to associate to the physician's scientific expertise, patient's wishes and preferences in a genuine personcentered medicine.

METHODS
Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from each eligible patient were tested for susceptibility to anti-TB drugs.
Sociobehavioural information was gathered in interviews based on a structured questionnaire.

FINDINGS
MDR-TB was found in 32.3% and 75.6% of the new and previously treated patients, respectively, and, 11.9% of the 612 patients found to have MDR-TB had extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
A history of previous treatment for TB was the strongest independent risk factor for MDR-TB (odds ratio, OR: 6.1; 95% confidence interval, CI: 4.8-7.7).

CONCLUSION
MDR-TB is very common among TB patients throughout Belarus.


OBJECTIVES
A secondary objective was to determine factors associated with positive serological screens.
Results of serological screens for parasites and relevant laboratory data were collected.

RESULTS
The patients' mean CD4(+) count was 0.45×10(9)/L, median viral load was undetectable and 68% were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Most originated from Africa (37%) and South America (35%).
Of the 97 patients, 10.4% and 8.3% had positive or equivocal screening results for strongyloidiasis, respectively, 7.4% and 4.2% had positive or equivocal screening results for schistosomiasis and 5.5% and 6.8% had positive or equivocal screens for filariasis.
All patients were asymptomatic.
Eosinophilia was not associated with positive screening results.

CONCLUSIONS
Using symptoms and eosinophilia to identify parasitic infection was not reliable.


METHODS
Stimuli received and emitted by pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were counted before (2010) and after (2012) implementation of corrective measures designed to limit interruptions.
The effect of corrective measures on targeted stimuli was measured with a t test.

RESULTS
Data were collected during a total of 93 randomly scheduled 30-min observation periods: 62 periods in 2010 (n = 2663 stimuli) and 31 periods in 2012 (n = 1217 stimuli).
The average hourly stimulus rate (± standard deviation) was unchanged after implementation of corrective measures: 85.9 ± 22.2 in 2010 and 78.5 ± 20.1 in 2012 (p = 0.06).

CONCLUSION
Other studies are needed to better characterize the nature and repercussions of stimuli, distractions, and interruptions.


METHODS
Two rural counties/districts in each of three provinces where NEMS had been implemented were surveyed.
The results were compared with the corresponding data recorded before NEMS was introduced.

FINDINGS
Following the introduction of NEMS, drug procurement in each study location was systematized.
Total drug costs declined.
This, and improved prescribing, reduced the costs of outpatient and inpatient care and led, apparently, to increased uptake of health services.
However, the prices of some drugs had increased and the availability of others had declined.
The compensation of health-care providers for NEMS-related reductions in their incomes had been largely ineffective.
As a result of the introduction of NEMS, health facilities relied more on public financing.
Many health-care providers complained about higher workloads and lower incomes.

CONCLUSION
It has highlighted the problems associated with attempts to modernize health care and health financing for patients' benefit.


METHODS
A competing risk regression model was used.

FINDINGS
The probability of ART initiation within 4 and 8 weeks after tuberculosis diagnosis rose from 23% and 65%, respectively, before implementation, to 62% and 90% after implementation.
A non-significant increase in 6-month retention and antiretroviral substitution was seen after implementation.

CONCLUSION
Implementation of 2010 WHO recommendations in a routine clinical setting shortens delay to ART.


METHODS
Data on 484 obstetric emergencies (242 deaths and 242 near-misses) were collected in 2008-2011.
Catastrophic expenditure for emergency obstetric care was assessed at different thresholds and its associated factors were explored through logistic regression.

FINDINGS
Despite the fee exemption policy for Caesareans and the maternity referral-system, designed to reduce the financial burden of emergency obstetric care, average expenses were 152 United States dollars (equivalent to 71 535 Communauté Financière Africaine francs) and 20.7 to 53.5% of households incurred catastrophic expenditures.
High expenditure for emergency obstetric care forced 44.6% of the households to reduce their food consumption and 23.2% were still indebted 10 months to two and a half years later.
Living in remote rural areas was associated with the risk of catastrophic spending, which shows the referral system's inability to eliminate financial obstacles for remote households.
Women who underwent Caesareans continued to incur catastrophic expenses, especially when prescribed drugs not included in the government-provided Caesarean kits.

CONCLUSION
The poor accessibility and affordability of emergency obstetric care has consequences beyond maternal deaths.


METHODS
PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Libraries were searched for literature assessing adverse pregnancy outcomes among untreated women with seroreactivity for Treponema pallidum infection and non-seroreactive women.
Adverse pregnancy outcomes were fetal loss or stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity or low birth weight, clinical evidence of syphilis and infant death.

FINDINGS
Of the 3258 citations identified, only six, all case-control studies, were included in the analysis.
Of the infants of mothers with untreated syphilis, 15% had clinical evidence of congenital syphilis.
The single study that estimated infant death showed a 10% higher frequency among infants of mothers with syphilis.

CONCLUSION
Untreated maternal syphilis is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.


STUDY DESIGN
Secondary outcomes were compared among the subgroups.

RESULTS
The final study population consisted of 196 extremely premature infants with a PDA.
The rate of surgical ligation in the 88 infants who received more than one course of indomethacin was 64%.
The PDA closed following the first course of indomethacin in only 20% of infants.

CONCLUSIONS
Ligation appears to have potential risks and benefits.


PROBLEM
During the 1980s, Spain had very strict laws limiting access to opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OAMT).
Because of this, mortality among people who used illicit opioids and other illicit drugs was high.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Legal changes facilitated the expansion of OAMT, which has achieved a coverage of 60%.
A parallel reduction in the annual incidence of HIV infection has been reported.
Reductions in morbidity and mortality and improved health-related quality of life have been described in patients undergoing OAMT.

LESSONS LEARNT
The treatment of opioid dependence has been more heavily influenced by moral concepts and prejudices that hinder legislation and interfere with the implementation of OAMT than by scientific evidence.
Longitudinal studies are needed to detect unmet needs and evaluate programme impact and suitability.


PURPOSE
The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is widely used in reconstruction.
The present systematic review summarizes the types of complications and their incidence with this flap.

RESULTS
Of the 2324 flaps, the majority were fasciocutaneous (n=737), and 1303 of the flaps were used in head and neck reconstruction.

CONCLUSION
Lateral thigh paresthesia is the most common complication.
Severe complications such as compartment syndrome and muscle necrosis can occur, but are rare.
Preservation of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, femoral motor nerve branches and deep fascia decreases the risk of complications.
The degree of vastus lateralis disruption did not show a significant impact on musculoskeletal dysfunction.


METHODS
The Medline, Embase and Cinahl databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles examining the effect of TFA policies.
In addition, the first 20 pages of Google searches were examined for articles from the grey literature.

FINDINGS
Overall, the TFA content of food decreased with all types of policy intervention.
In general, saturated fat levels increased or decreased, depending on the product type, and total fat content remained stable.

CONCLUSION
Such policies are feasible, achievable and likely to have an effect on public health.


PROBLEM
In the north-eastern Indian states of Manipur and Nagaland, the epidemic of HIV infection is driven by the injection of illicit drugs, especially opioids.

LOCAL SETTING
The prevalence of HIV infection among people injecting drugs was 24.5% in Manipur and 8.4% in Nagaland.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Opioid agonist maintenance treatment coverage was 13.7% and retention 6 months after enrolment was 63%.
Antiretroviral treatment coverage for HIV-positive participants was 81%.

LESSONS LEARNT
Project ORCHID has influenced national harm reduction policy in India and contributed to the development of harm reduction guidelines.


METHODS
Lists of residents and project titles for the period of interest were obtained from residency coordinators.
The library holdings of the University of Toronto were reviewed to determine study characteristics of the Ontario residency projects.

RESULTS
For the objective of this study relating to publication rate, 518 projects were included.
The overall publication rate was 32.2% (60 [35.9%] as abstracts and 107 [64.1%] as full-text manuscripts).
Publication in pharmacy-specific journals (66 [61.7%] of 107 full-text manuscripts) was more frequent than publication in non-pharmacy-specific journals.
The publication rate of projects as full-text manuscripts remained stable over time.
Of the 202 Ontario residency projects archived in the University of Toronto's library, most were cohort studies (83 [41.1%]), and the most common topic was efficacy and/or safety of a medication (46 [22.8%]).

CONCLUSIONS
Most projects were observational studies.


METHODS
Semi-parametric growth modeling was used to identify sex-specific trajectories of depressive symptoms.

RESULTS
Trajectory group was a statistically significant independent predictor of depression, stress, and self-rated mental health in young adulthood in boys and girls.
Boys, but not girls, in the high trajectory group had a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of seeking psychiatric care.

CONCLUSIONS
Substantial heterogeneity in changes in depressive symptoms over time was found.


METHODS
Age-specific smoking prevalence among cohorts born between 1897 and 1985 were determined for the period 1949-2010.

FINDINGS
Recent cohorts of females showed relatively high prevalences of smoking and relatively high percentages of early initiation.
In both sexes, lung cancer mortality was generally low but increased over the study period.

CONCLUSION
Lung cancer mortality in Japanese males was relatively low given the high prevalence of smoking, perhaps because early initiation was fairly uncommon.
Over the last four decades, however, early initiation of smoking has become more common in both sexes.


METHODS
Contingency tables and multivariate analysis were used to compare risk factors and pregnancy outcomes in women who did or did not have an episiotomy.

FINDINGS
The episiotomy rate in 12 208 Vietnamese-born women was 29.9%, compared with 15.1% in Australian-born women.
In these women, having an episiotomy was associated with postpartum haemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 1.26; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.08-1.46) and postnatal hospitalization for more than 4 days (aOR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.00-1.29).
Among multiparous women only, episiotomy was positively associated with a third- or fourth-degree perineal tear (aOR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.31-3.06); in contrast, among primiparous women the association was negative (aOR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.37-0.60).

CONCLUSION
A lower episiotomy rate should be achievable in Viet Nam.


Title
Evolution of the determinants of chronic liver disease in Quebec.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) are a worldwide problem.

RESULTS
The overall hepatitis B and C incidence and CLD mortality rates are falling.
However, liver cancer and mortality rates, especially among men and the elderly, are on the rise.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A nineteen year old male presented to an orthopaedic surgeon with a long history of back pain.
He was initially diagnosed with soft tissue injuries and discharged.
The patient did not present to the surgeon until two years after his symptom profile changed.
At that point, MRI examinations revealed a large myxopapillary ependymoma extending from T12 to L4 that was confirmed by a pathologist.

INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
The tumour was surgically resected with subsequent adjuvant radiotherapy.
Follow-up MRI examinations revealed no disease progression or new spinal lesions at 4 years after the initial diagnosis.

CONCLUSION
The clinical presentation of primary spinal cord tumours is non-specific and can easily be missed.
In cases of chronic back pain, signs and symptoms should be regularly monitored for changes indicative of progressive neurological compromise such as sensory, motor and bowel/bladder dysfunction.
If there is deterioration of clinical signs and symptoms, a spinal tumour should be considered in the list of differential diagnoses.


METHODS
For responses to this question, 2 raters established response categories, obtained acceptable inter-rater agreement, and independently scored the responses.

RESULTS
Four global categories of responses were obtained, each having multiple subcategories.
Of the 703 responses (from 325 respondents), 445 (63.3%) were related to the category "information about medications", including purpose, adherence, and side effects.
The second most common response category was "self-disclosure" (167 [23.8%]), including experiences with pharmacies, medications, or hospitals.

CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that many patients are unaware of other potential clinical services that pharmacists can provide.


METHODS
The main outcomes of interest were rates of common perinatal mental disorders (CPMDs), primarily postpartum depression or anxiety; measures of the quality of the mother-infant relationship; and measures of infant or child health, growth and cognitive development.
Meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a summary measure of the clinical effectiveness of the interventions.

FINDINGS
Thirteen trials representing 20 092 participants were identified.
In all studies, supervised, non-specialist health and community workers delivered the interventions, which proved more beneficial than routine care for both mothers and children.
The pooled effect size for maternal depression was -0.38 (95% confidence interval: -0.56 to -0.21; I (2) = 79.9%).
Where assessed, benefits to the child included improved mother-infant interaction, better cognitive development and growth, reduced diarrhoeal episodes and increased immunization rates.

CONCLUSION
In LAMI countries, the burden of CPMDs can be reduced through mental health interventions delivered by supervised non-specialists.


OBJECTIVE
We outline a rational approach to psychiatric treatment of a patient with a complex medical condition.

RESULTS
A 14-year-old female began rapidly gaining weight as a preschooler, developed hormonal imbalance, and mixed sleep apnea.
Consultation was requested after a month of ROHHAD exacerbation, with severe anxiety, insomnia, and auditory hallucinations.
Olanzapine and citalopram were helpful in controlling the symptoms.
Following discharge, the patient gained weight and olanzapine was discontinued.
Lorazepam was started in coordination with pulmonary service.
Relevant pharmacologic considerations included risk of respiratory suppression, history of paradoxical reaction to hypnotics, hepatic isoenzyme interactions and side effects of antipsychotics.

CONCLUSIONS
Core symptoms of ROHHAD may precipitate psychiatric disorders.
A systematic evidence-based approach to psychopharmacology is necessary in the setting of psychiatric consultation.


Title
Chronic bronchitis in Aboriginal people--prevalence and associated factors.

RESULTS
CB prevalence was 6.6% among First Nations, 6.2% among Métis and 2.4% among Inuit.
Prevalence was higher among females than males (7.2% versus 5.0%).
Smoking status and body mass index were also significantly associated with CB, but their effect differed by sex.

CONCLUSION
These findings identify factors associated with CB among Aboriginal people.


METHODS
A panel of four slides was delivered to diagnostic laboratories in all provinces of the country.

FINDINGS
Of 356 laboratories contacted, 277 (77.8%) responded.
Overall, 35.0% of the laboratories reported all four slides correctly but 14.1% reported correct results for 1 or 0 slides.
Malaria rapid diagnostic tests were used by 44.3% of laboratories, almost double the proportion observed in the previous quality assessment.

CONCLUSION
The overall quality of blood film microscopy was poor but was improved by participation in external quality assessments.
The failure to recognize trypanosomes in a country where sleeping sickness is endemic is a concern.


METHODS
A surgeon in a rural centre was credentialed to perform endovascular aortic aneurysm repair through collaboration with a university centre and was proctored locally for the first 5 abdominal aneurysm repairs.
Referred patients were screened for multiple aneurysms and underwent long-term monitoring.

RESULTS
In all, 160 patients were evaluated for 176 aortic pathologies.
Twenty-five patients (17 men) aged 55-89 years underwent 26 endovascular abdominal (n = 23) or thoracic (n = 3) aortic procedures.
Emergent endovascular procedures were not performed.
There were no operative deaths, requirements for dialysis or conversions to open repair.
Two endoleaks required early reintervention.
The median length of stay in hospital for endovascular procedures was 2.5 days.
Chronic endoleaks were observed in 7 patients.
An additional 8 patients underwent open abdominal aneurysm repair locally and 15 patients were referred to the university program.

CONCLUSION
Creation of an endovascular aortic surgery program in a rural hospital is feasible through collaboration with a high-volume centre.


METHODS
We reviewed NRs for patients undergoing a pancreaticoduodenectomy over a 1-year period.

RESULTS
We analyzed 74 NRs.
The median number of variables reported was 43.5 (range 13-54).
Process of care and oncology-related variables were often omitted.

CONCLUSION
The NRs were often incomplete and of poor quality.
Thus, the NR is an inadequate data source for QI.


INTRODUCTION
The objective of this study was to examine the safety of small perinatal surgical services.

METHODS
We accessed perinatal data for singleton births that occurred in British Columbia between Apr. 1, 2000, and Mar. 31, 2007.

RESULTS
A total of 87 294 births occurred during the study period.


LOCAL SETTING
The communication tools that were available were generally inadequate.

RELEVANT CHANGES
The team also collaborated with public health nurses in rebuilding communication networks.
Public health nurses alerted evacuation centres to epidemics of communicable disease.

LESSONS LEARNT
Modern health-care systems are highly vulnerable to the loss of advanced technological tools.


OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to determine the cause of opioid incidents requiring administration of naloxone, an opioid reversal agent.

METHODS
A retrospective chart analysis was conducted using records from 2 acute care centres in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.
Cases were classified as preventable or nonpreventable.
Preventable cases were analyzed to determine the phase of the medication-use process during which the incident occurred.
These cases were also grouped thematically by the type of incident.
The drug most likely responsible for opioid toxicity was determined for each case.
The proportion of cases documented by occurrence reporting was also noted.

RESULTS
Thirty-six cases involving administration of naloxone were identified, of which 29 (81%) were deemed preventable.
Morphine was the drug that most frequently resulted in toxic effects (18 cases [50%]).
Only two of the cases (5.6%) were documented by occurrence reports.


OBJECTIVES
To determine whether the recommended nutritional intake of moderately to severely neurologically impaired children is congruent with current growth parameter expectations.
Observation
al cross-sectional study at a children's hospice and a tertiary care children's hospital.
Intakes, guidelines and recommendations were compared.

RESULTS
Intakes were less than recommended.

CONCLUSIONS
Recommended dietary intakes were not achieved by these children.
Low weight values may reflect diagnosis-related growth stunting or decreased muscle mass and bone density from immobility.


METHODS
We then compared these records with the corresponding patients' hospital charts to assess the level of agreement for procedure coding.
We calculated the PPV and sensitivity to estimate the validity of vascular injury diagnosis coding.

RESULTS
The overall PPV for vascular injury coding was estimated to be 95% (95% confidence interval [CI] 92.3-96.8).

CONCLUSION
Observation
al Study Level III.


METHODS
Statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan software.

RESULTS
Five worldwide RCTs with 196 patients in the LRYGB group and 200 in the LSG group were included in our analysis.
There was no difference in the reoperation rate between the groups.
However, patients treated with LRYGB had a higher incidence of complication than those treated with LSG.

CONCLUSION
Our meta-analysis demonstrates that LRYGB is more effective than LSG for the surgical treatment of T2DM and control of metabolic syndrome.
However, LSG is safer and has a reduced rate of complications.


CLINICAL FEATURES
The differential diagnosis of tear of the medial head of the gastrocnemius was confirmed by physical examination and diagnostic ultrasound imaging.

INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
The patient was treated over a 6 week period.

SUMMARY
With an accurate diagnosis and comprehension of classification of muscle injuries, management of gastrocnemius tears is straightforward.


PROBLEM
The local health infrastructure was especially weak.

APPROACH
To ensure service accessibility, financial risk protection schemes were expanded.

LOCAL SETTING
In Thailand, district hospitals were practically non-existent in the 1960s.
Expansion of primary health care (PHC), especially in poor rural areas, was considered essential for attaining universal health coverage (UHC).
Nationwide reforms led to important changes in a few decades.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Between 1980 and 2000 coverage with maternal and child health services increased substantially.
By 2002, Thailand had attained UHC.
Overall health system development, particularly an expanded health workforce, resulted in a functioning PHC system.


METHODS
In each of 10 states, the largest district and the one most distant from the state capital were selected for study.

FINDINGS
In shake tests conducted at the end of the study, two thirds of the vaccine vials in the boxes showed evidence of freezing.

CONCLUSION
Systematic efforts are needed to improve temperature monitoring in the cold-chain system in India.


METHODS
Modified Poisson regressions were used to estimate relative risks (RRs).

FINDINGS
At the time of the survey, nearly 40% of Chinese people aged 45 years or older had a hypertensive disorder.

CONCLUSION
A reduction in the costs of outpatient care to patients would probably improve the management of hypertension in China.


BACKGROUND
Approximately 26% of Canadians living with HIV are unaware of their status.

RESULTS
In total, 501 adults participated in the study.
The majority of participants were younger than 40 years of age, approximately one-half (48.5%) were women and 53% self-identified as Aboriginal.
Nearly one-half (49.1%) of the participants had undergone previous HIV testing, although 63% of these tests were performed more than a year earlier.
Nearly all of the participants (96%) reported satisfaction with the test and believed it belonged in the ED (93%).

CONCLUSIONS
Furthermore, all individuals were linked to timely care.
The present study demonstrated that this particular busy tertiary care ED is an important and feasible location for HIV POC testing.


METHODS
We analyzed the responses to develop a standardized handover checklist.

RESULTS
Of the 1106 COA members, 247 responded to the questionnaire.

CONCLUSION
Our main recommendations for safe handover are to use standardized checklists specific to the patient and site needs.


METHODS
For patients older than 8 months, a CV cutdown was tried initially.
We recorded information on age, weight, outcome of the CV cutdown and complications.

RESULTS
During the study period, 143 patients underwent a venous cutdown for implantation of a TICVP: 25 younger and 118 older than 8 months.
The CV cutdown was successful in 73 of 118 trials.
The 25th percentile and median body weight for 73 successful cases were 15.4 kg and 28.3 kg, respectively.
There was a significant difference in the success rate using the criterion of 15 kg as the cutoff.
The overall complication rate was 8.2%.

CONCLUSION
The CV cutdown was an acceptable procedure for TICVP in children.


METHODS
We compared quality indicators and outcomes between patients transferred from a peripheral hospital and those directly admitted to the trauma centre.

RESULTS
Of the 1191 patients retrospectively reviewed, 890 met our inclusion criteria: 175 who were transferred and 715 admitted directly to the trauma centre.
Transfer patients' median delay from admission to operation was 93 hours, whereas nontransfer patients waited 44 hours (p < 0.001).
The median length of stay in hospital was 20 days for transfer patients compared with 13 days for nontransfer patients (p < 0.001).
Regional policy changes enacted in 2011 decreased the median transfer delay from regional hospital to tertiary care centre from 47 to 27 hours (p = 0.005).

CONCLUSION
Policy changes can have a significant impact on patient care.


METHODS
Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria.
Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated.
Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed.

FINDINGS
Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34 706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific).
Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up.

CONCLUSION
Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts.


OBJECTIVES
The purpose of this study was to optimize the treatment of patients with pneumonia under hospitalist care by focusing on best practice and local antibiogram data.

METHODS
Review of pneumonia guidelines and the local antibiogram assisted in identifying the study strategy.
A presentation to the hospitalists outlined antimicrobial stewardship principles and described the findings of the baseline audit.
Pre- and post-intervention audit results were compared.

RESULTS
Local best-practice treatment algorithms were developed for community-acquired pneumonia and for hospital-acquired and health care-associated pneumonia.
The post-intervention audit covered the period December 2012 to January 2013.
Adherence to the treatment algorithms increased from 10% (2/21) in the pre-intervention audit to 38% (5/13) in the post-intervention audit.
There was a trend to reduced duration of therapy in the post-intervention group.


METHODS
We used the patients' medical records and the Alberta Trauma Registry.

RESULTS
Among 1000 patients (mean age 48 yr, male sex 70%, mean injury severity score 23, mortality 10%), 627 underwent BAL testing at admission; 221 (35%) had a BAL greater than 0 mmol/L, and 189 (30%) had a BAL above the legal limit of 17.4 mmol/L.
The mean positive BAL was 41.9 mmol/L.
More than 4% had a known history of alcohol abuse.
More patients were assaulted (20% v. 9%) or hit by motor vehicles (10% v. 6%) when intoxicated (both p < 0.05).
Most injuries occurred after falls (37%) and motor vehicle collisions (33%).
Overall, 17% of patients received thiamine prophylaxis.
Of the 221 patients with elevated BAL, 44% received thiamine prophylaxis.
Of those with a history of alcohol abuse, 77% received thiamine prophylaxis.

CONCLUSION
Furthermore, a minority of intoxicated patients received adequate prophylaxis against WE.
Given the low risk and cost of BAL testing and thiamine prophylaxis and the high cost of delirium, standard protocols for prophylaxis are essential.


METHODS
To remove the migrated band, we used an endoscopic approach with a Gastric Band Cutter.

RESULTS
Band or tube erosion occurred in 14 patients (12.7%).
The median time interval from the initial gastric band placement to the diagnosis of band erosion was 32 (range 18-52) months.
Upper abdominal pain, port site infection, loss of restriction and weight regain were the most common symptoms.
We used the Gastric Band Cutter to remove the band endoscopically.
In 2 patients, the band, after being cut, was locked in the gastric wall and required laparotomic removal.
In 1 patient, we performed surgery for intragastric penetration of the connecting tube broken close to the band.

CONCLUSION
Endoscopic removal seems to be effective and safe for band erosion.


METHODS
Usernames and passwords were assigned to general surgery residents at the University of Alberta.
Afterwards, they were able to access the interactive modules.
We used paired t tests to assess the difference between pre- and postcourse scores.

RESULTS
Out of 34 residents who agreed to participate in the project, 12 completed the project (35.3%).
For these 12 residents, the precourse mean score was 50 ± 17.3 and the postcourse mean score was 67 ± 14 (p = 0.020).

CONCLUSION
Most residents who participated in this study recommended using the iBIMs as a study tool for bariatric surgery.


METHODS
We searched PubMed and Embase using a strategy developed in collaboration with an expert librarian.
We extracted data using a standardized form and assessed study quality using the QUIPS tool.

RESULTS
Nine cohort studies representing 2958 patients satisfied our selection criteria.
All studies focused on postoperative mortality.
Thirty-four prognostic factors were examined, with significant variability across studies.
There was limited or conflicting evidence for most prognostic factors.

CONCLUSION
Further research is needed to help guide patient care and potentially improve outcomes.


METHODS
We conducted a qualitative research study in rural Quebec.
We used purposeful sampling to recruit study participants.
We conducted thematic analysis to identify themes.
This included interview debriefing, transcript coding, data display and interpretation.

RESULTS
Saturation was reached after 15 interviews.
Five main themes emerged from the interviews: rural idyll, perceived oral health, access to oral health care, cues to action and access to dental information.
However, they criticized the limited access to dental care in rural communities and voiced concerns about the impact on their oral health.

CONCLUSION
Residents' satisfaction with the rural lifestyle may be affected by unsatisfactory oral health care.


METHODS
In an observational study using a difference-in-differences design, the relationship between the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme and the probability of delivery in health-care institutions, the probability of obstetric complications and mean household expenditure for deliveries was subsequently examined.
In multivariate regressions, individual and household characteristics as well as district and year fixed effects were controlled for.
Data from the most recent District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS-3) wave conducted in Gujarat (n = 6484 households) were used in parallel analyses.

FINDINGS
Between 2005 and 2010, the Chiranjeevi Yojana programme was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of institutional delivery (2.42 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI: -5.90 to 10.74) or of birth-related complications (6.16 percentage points; 95% CI: -2.63 to 14.95).
Estimates using DLHS-3 data were similar.

CONCLUSION
The Chiranjeevi Yojana programme appears to have had no significant impact on institutional delivery rates or maternal health outcomes.
The absence of estimated reductions in household spending for private-sector deliveries deserves further study.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in Bangladesh using national survey data and to identify risk factors.

METHODS
Risk factors for diabetes and prediabetes were identified using multilevel logistic regression models, with adjustment for clustering within households and communities.

FINDINGS
The overall age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes was 9.7% and 22.4%, respectively.
Among urban residents, the age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 15.2% compared with 8.3% among rural residents.
In total, 56.0% of diabetics were not aware they had the condition and only 39.5% were receiving treatment regularly.
The likelihood of diabetes in individuals aged 55 to 59 years was almost double that in those aged 35 to 39 years.
Study participants from the richest households were more likely to have diabetes than those from the poorest.
In addition, the likelihood of diabetes was also significantly associated with educational level, body weight and the presence of hypertension.
The prevalence of diabetes varied significantly with region of residence.


APPROACH
This institute provided a year-long training programme for clinicians that focused on research methods in population health and sociocultural anthropology.
The programme included didactic experiences in Guatemala and the United States as well as applied training in which participants developed research protocols responsive to Guatemala's cancer needs.

LOCAL SETTING
INCAN is thus a resource for capacity building within the context of cancer prevention and control.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Trainees increased their self-efficacy for the design and conduct of research.

LESSONS LEARNT
A training programme for clinicians can build cancer research capacity in low- and middle-income countries.
Training in population-based research methods will enable countries such as Guatemala to gather country-specific data.


METHODS
The interviews incorporated standardized psychometric measures of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief (CG).
Social support was also assessed.
An adjusted model taking potential confounders into account was used to explore any association between psychological symptoms and the birth of a subsequent child.

FINDINGS
The prevalence of psychological symptoms was higher in mothers who did not have a child after losing the first one.
More than two thirds of the mothers with new infants had clinically important psychological symptoms.

CONCLUSION
Research should focus on developing and evaluating interventions designed to provide women with psychosocial support and reproductive services.


METHODS
We compared patients who had surgery for morbid obesity with healthy, nonobese controls.

RESULTS
We included 20 patients who had surgery for morbid obesity (8 men, 12 women, mean body mass index [BMI] 46.82 ± 4.47) and 20 healthy, nonobese people (10 men, 10 women, mean BMI 22.52 ± 2.08) in our study.
There was no significant difference in serum 8-OHdG levels between the groups, whereas urinary 8- OHdG levels were significantly higher in morbidly obese patients than in controls.
Weight, BMI and serum and urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly decreased in morbidly obese patients 6 months after LAGB.

CONCLUSION
The LAGB provides efficient weight loss in patients with morbid obesity.


METHODS
We reviewed the cases of patients with periprosthetic femoral fractures treated between January 2004 and June 2009.
We used the Vancouver classification to assess fracture types, and we identified the surgical interventions used for these fracture types and the associated complications.

RESULTS
We treated 45 patients with periprosthetic femoral fractures during the study period (15 men, 30 women, mean age 78 yr).

CONCLUSION
Periprosthetic fractures are difficult to manage.
However, patients should be counselled on the high risk of complications when presenting with this problem.


OBJECTIVE
This study describes patient and treatment characteristics of such children/youth.

METHODS
Socio-demographic and ED visit data were analyzed descriptively.

RESULTS
During the study period, 365 consecutive presentations made by 325 children/youth.
The most common presenting complaints were related to depression/self-harm (45.8%) and violent behaviours (28.8%).
Many children/youth had a previously diagnosed psychiatric disorder (59.4%) and identified being under the care of a child psychiatrist (42.2%).
The majority of ED visits were triaged as urgent or emergent (51.5% and 41.1%, respectively) and included mood and suicidality assessments (84.7% and 80.8%, respectively).
Follow-up with various services was made for all visits.


INTRODUCTION
Parental satisfaction may improve long-term adherence to physician recommendations.

OBJECTIVE
To explore parental satisfaction with a PCC.

RESULTS
The majority of parents stated they were either somewhat satisfied (49/122, 40.2%) or very satisfied (49/122, 40.2%) with the PCC.

CONCLUSIONS
Parents were satisfied overall with an urgent care service model.


INTRODUCTION
Understanding the characteristics of experimental smoking among youth is critical for designing prevention programs.

RESULTS
Experimental smoking rates varied between schools (p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION
Schools located in rural settings may require additional resources.


INTRODUCTION
The recruitment and retention of physicians in rural communities is a challenge throughout Canada and across the globe.
In 1976, a group of medical students profiled rural communities with medical practices and produced a summary report entitled Medical Practice in Saskatchewan.

METHODS
Physicians practising in rural Saskatchewan were interviewed in 2011 and 2012.

RESULTS
Sixty-two physicians were interviewed and 105 communities profiled.


INTRODUCTION
Recently, invasive illness from this common pathogen has become a serious clinical problem in the region.
We sought to better understand this trend of invasive CA-MRSA.

METHODS
We examined genetic typing, comorbidities and outcomes.

RESULTS
Twenty-three cases of CA-MRSA bacteremia were treated during the 2-year study period.
One death and 2 cases of endocarditis occurred.


METHODS
We prospectively reviewed the cases of consecutive patients undergoing total or completion thyroidectomy.

RESULTS
We reviewed the cases of 149 patients.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of a low PTH-1 were 89%, 100%, 97% and 100%, respectively.

CONCLUSION
We found that PTH-1 levels were predictive of symptomatic hypocalcemia 24 hours after thyroidectomy.


METHODS
Demographic, operative and oncologic data were collected to compare outcomes between HLAPD and OPD.

RESULTS
Our analysis included 33 patients (HLAPD: n = 13; OPD: n = 20).
There were no differences in patient demographics, comorbidities or surgical indications.
The HLAPD group had significantly lower intraoperative blood loss (450 mL v. 1000 mL, p = 0.023) and shorter length of hospital stay (8 v. 12 d, p = 0.025) than the OPD group.
Duration of surgery did not differ significantly between the groups.
There were no differences in postoperative analgesic requirements, Clavien grade I/II or grade III/IV complications or 90-day mortality.
Oncologic outcomes showed no significant differences in tumour size, R1 resection rate or number of lymph nodes harvested.

CONCLUSION
In select patients, HLAPD is a safe and effective procedure with comparable outcomes to conventional open surgery.


METHODS
Chinese economic development indicators were obtained from the World Bank.
Trends in body weight, height, economic data and diet were examined.
Regional differences in physical growth were assessed.

FINDINGS
Between 1975 and 2010, the growth of children and adolescents improved in tandem with economic development.
The largest increment in height was observed during the period of puberty.
Regional inequalities in nutritional status were correlated with disparities in economic development among regions.
A large increase in obesity was observed in both urban and rural areas, but especially in large cities and, more recently, in small and medium-sized cities and affluent rural areas.

CONCLUSION
The average weight of children and adolescents has been increasing progressively since the 1970s.


METHODS
Combination antiretroviral regimens were offered to pregnant and breastfeeding, HIV-infected women, irrespective of immunological status, at four rural health facilities.
Twenty-four-month HIV-free survival among children born to HIV-infected mothers was determined before and after PMTCT programme implementation using community surveys.
Households were randomly selected and women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were asked to participate.
Multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with child HIV infection or death.

FINDINGS
In the first survey (2008-2009), 335 of 1778 women (18.8%) tested positive for HIV.
In the second (2011), 390 of 2386 (16.3%) tested positive.
Maternal knowledge of HIV status, use of HIV tests and use of combination regimens during pregnancy increased between the surveys.

CONCLUSION
Maternal utilization of HIV testing and treatment in the community also increased.


PROBLEM
However, large-scale use of a new technology calls for preparation and adaptation.

APPROACH
A pilot implementation study was conducted in two Brazilian cities to explore the replacement of sputum smear microscopy with Xpert.
The laboratories included covered 70% of the tuberculosis cases diagnosed, had no overlap in population catchment areas, handled different workloads and were randomly shifted to Xpert.
Sputum samples were collected through the same routine procedures.
Before the study the medical information system was prepared for the recording of Xpert results.
Laboratory technicians were trained to operate Xpert machines and health workers were taught how to interpret the results.

LOCAL SETTING
However, co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and multidrug resistance are relatively infrequent (10% and < 2%, respectively).

RELEVANT CHANGES
Of the tested sputum samples, 7.3% were too scanty for Xpert and had to be examined microscopically.

LESSONS LEARNT
Ensuring cartridge availability is also essential.
The capacity to perform smear microscopy should be retained.
The medical information system needs updating to allow efficient use of Xpert.


METHODS
A prospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was conducted over a 7-month period.

RESULTS
Thirty (62%) of the 48 patients experienced symptoms of "red man syndrome", and 7 (15%) experienced some degree of nephrotoxicity.
Two of 3 patients with laboratory-reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for identified pathogens had a calculated area under the curve to MIC ratio greater than or equal to 400.

CONCLUSION
A substantial number of adverse drug reactions were observed.


METHODS
We measured HRV by frequency domain parameters.

RESULTS
We included 29 surgeons in our analysis.
Increased high-frequency (HF) activity was found precall (median 199, IQR 75-365 ms2) compared with on call (median 99, IQR 48-177 ms2, p < 0.001).
We found no correlation between the LF:HF ratio and performance in laparoscopic simulation.

TRIAL REGISTRATION
NCT01623674 (www.clinicaltrials.gov).


INTRODUCTION
Northwestern Ontario is a large rural area with a high concentration of remote First Nations communities.
In Ontario, the highest hospital admission rates for pneumonia are reported from northern and rural regions.
However, data are lacking on the epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia in northwestern Ontario.
We sought to characterize cases of community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission at the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre, which serves a primarily First Nations population of 28,000.

RESULTS
The annual incidence of hospital admissions related to community-acquired pneumonia was 3.42 per 1000 population.
Of the 287 patients, 87% were First Nations and 52% were female.
There was a high prevalence of diabetes, and chronic cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary diseases.
Adverse outcomes included 10 deaths (3%) and 35 transfers to an intensive care facility (12%).

CONCLUSION
Our findings emphasize the importance of preventing pneumonia in First Nations communities in northwestern Ontario.


OBJECTIVE
Cognitive training entails the repeated exercise of a specific cognitive process over a period of time to improve performance on the trained task as well as on tasks that were not specifically trained (transfer effect).
We discuss evidence from studies that have produced broad, limited, or no transfer effects with the goal of identifying factors that may be responsible for this heterogeneity.

RESULTS
We identify these implicit assumptions and their weaknesses.
We also draw attention to design limitations that may be contributing to lack of transfer.

CONCLUSION
We hypothesize several suggestions that may improve training effects and summarize the evidence which led to our hypotheses.


METHODS
The survey contained questions to identify factors that could predict students' intentions to migrate.
Primary outcomes were the likelihoods of migrating to work abroad or working in rural areas in the country of training within five years post-training.

FINDINGS
Among respondents, 28% (870/3156) expected to migrate abroad, while only 18% (575/3158) anticipated a rural career.
More nursing than medical students desired professions abroad (odds ratio, OR: 1.76; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.25-2.48).
Career desires before matriculation correlated with current intentions for international (OR: 4.49; 95% CI: 3.21-6.29) and rural (OR: 4.84; 95% CI: 3.52-6.66) careers.

CONCLUSION
A significant proportion of students surveyed still intend to work abroad or in cities after training.
These intentions could be identified even before matriculation.


METHODS
We did a cross-sectional population-based survey in five municipalities of Kathmandu Valley between November 2011 and January 2012.
For each household surveyed, out-of-pocket spending on health in the previous 30 days that exceeded 10% of the household's total expenditure over the same period was considered to be catastrophic.
We estimated the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure.
We identified the illnesses most commonly associated with such expenditure using a Poisson regression model and assessed the distribution of expenditure by economic quintile of households using the concentration index.

FINDINGS
Catastrophic expenditure by households in the poorest quintile were associated with at least one episode of diabetes, asthma or heart disease.

CONCLUSION
Throughout Nepal, interventions for the control and management of noncommunicable diseases and the prevention of road traffic accidents should be promoted.
A phased introduction of health insurance should also reduce the incidence of catastrophic household expenditure.


LOCAL SETTING
There was no early warning disease surveillance system.

RELEVANT CHANGES
By 25 February, an EWARN was operational in five health facilities that served 90% of the displaced population.
Eight priority diseases or syndromes were reported weekly; unexpected health events were reported immediately.
Between 25 February and 19 May, 1177 target diseases or syndrome cases were reported.
Seven alerts were investigated.
No sustained transmission or epidemics were identified.
Reporting compliance was 85%.
The EWARN was then transitioned to the routine four-syndrome early warning disease surveillance system.

LESSON LEARNT
Local capacities and available resources should be considered in planning EWARN implementation.


METHODS
Data came from demographic surveillance sites, randomized trials and an extended Demographic and Health Survey.
The type of diarrhoea was classified as acute watery, acute bloody or persistent and risk factors were identified.
Deaths in children aged 1 to 11 months and 1 to 4 years were analysed separately.

FINDINGS
Among children aged 1-4 years, acute watery diarrhoea accounted for 31-69% of diarrhoeal deaths, acute bloody diarrhoea for 12-28%, and persistent diarrhoea for 12-56%.
At most sites, more than 40% of children who died from persistent diarrhoea were malnourished.

CONCLUSION
Persistent diarrhoea remains an important cause of diarrhoeal death in young children in low- and middle-income countries.


APPROACH
This paper describes the strategy deployed, the uptake of services and the key lessons learnt in the first 18 months of implementation.

LOCAL SETTING
In 2012, Namacurra´s adult population was estimated to be 125,425, and of those 15,803 were estimated to be HIV infected.

LESSONS LEARNT
The clinics best serve as a transition to improved capacity at fixed-site services.


PROBLEM
In 2010, dengue virus (DENV) serotype-4 was detected during a dengue outbreak in the Amazonian city of Boa Vista.
At that time Brazil was already endemic for DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3.

APPROACH
To hinder the spread of DENV-4 throughout Brazil, standard vector control measures were intensified.
Water storage containers were treated with the larvicide diflubenzuron, and deltamethrin was sprayed for adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
Fifteen days later, a second larvae survey and additional deltamethrin applications were performed.

LOCAL SETTING
Educational dengue control campaigns in communities are scarce, especially between outbreaks.

LESSONS LEARNT
There is a need to redesign all levels of dengue control.
Public consultation and engagement, behaviour change and actions that go beyond technical impositions are required.


PROBLEM
The longitudinal demographic surveillance systems often used as sampling frames are difficult to create in many resource-poor settings.

APPROACH
We used Google Earth imagery and geographical analysis software to develop a sampling frame.
A random sample was then generated from the list of households.

LESSONS LEARNT
In the development of a geographical sampling frame, the use of Google Earth satellite imagery and geographical software appeared to be an efficient alternative to the use of a demographic surveillance system.
The use of a complete list of household coordinates reduced the time needed to locate households in the random sample.


METHODS
We reviewed Manitoba Cancer Registry data on patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosed between 2004 and 2006.

RESULTS
Twenty rural patients with rectal cancer participated in interviews.

CONCLUSION
A substantial proportion of rural patients with rectal cancer undergo surgery at urban centres.
The reasons are complex and only partly related to patient choice.


APPROACH
Between 2007 and 2013, 14 workshops were conducted in China, Myanmar and the Russian Federation.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Clinicians learnt how to do binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy and to diagnose CMV retinitis.
In China and the Russian Federation, the success rates were lower, with 10/15 and 3/5 trainees, respectively, providing follow-up data.

LESSONS LEARNT
Successful implementation depends on institutional support, ongoing training and technical support.
The next challenge is to scale up this approach in other countries.


METHODS
For the remaining 129 countries, we used multinomial logistic models to estimate these distributions.
We applied cause-specific proportions to neonatal death estimates from the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, by country and year, to estimate cause-specific risks and numbers of deaths.

FINDINGS
Over time, neonatal deaths decreased for most causes.
Preterm birth complications were the leading cause of death in all regions of the world.

CONCLUSION
The neonatal cause-of-death distribution differs between the early and late periods and varies with neonatal mortality rate level.


METHODS
Information from a wide range of other sources, including the grey literature, was also analysed.
Two independent reviewers extracted data on treatment adherence and study characteristics.
Study data on the association between being employed and adhering to ART were pooled using a random-effects model.
Between-study heterogeneity and sources of bias were evaluated.

FINDINGS
The overall pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between being employed and adhering to ART was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.04-1.55).
The association was significant for studies from low-income countries (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.58-2.18) and high-income countries (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.74) but not middle-income countries (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.62-1.42).

CONCLUSION
Employed HIV-infected individuals, particularly those in low- and high-income countries, were more likely to adhere to ART than unemployed individuals.


PROBLEM
Ghana's population is ageing.

APPROACH
We applied WHO's knowledge translation framework on ageing and health to assist evidence based policy-making in Ghana.
Second, we gathered evidence on effective health systems interventions in low- middle- and high-income countries.
Third, key stakeholders were engaged in a policy dialogue.
Fourth, policy briefs were developed and presented to the Ghana Health Services.

RELEVANT CHANGES
The key stakeholders drafted evidence-based policy recommendations that were used to develop policy briefs.
The briefs were presented to the Ghana Health Service in 2014.

LESSONS LEARNT
The framework can be used to build local capacity on evidence-informed policy-making.
However, knowledge translation tools need further development to be used in low-income countries and in the field of ageing.
The terms and language of the tools need to be adapted to local contexts.
Evidence for health system interventions on ageing populations is very limited, particularly for low- and middle-income settings.


METHODS
Data are reported as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) and proportions.

RESULTS
Over a 1-year period, 192 patients presented a total of 266 times with acute exacerbation of COPD.
Overall, short-acting β-agonists (63.5%), anticholinergic agents (53.4%), corticosteroids (54.5%) and antibiotics (71.1%) were prescribed more commonly to discharged patients (p < 0.05 for all).

CONCLUSION
Moreover, we identified gaps in both diagnostic and therapeutic care.


INTRODUCTION
We sought to assess the economic contribution of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) to northern Ontario communities participating in NOSM's distributed medical education programs.

METHODS
We developed a local economic model and used actual expenditures from 2007/08 to assess the economic contribution of NOSM to communities in northern Ontario.

RESULTS
Communities might realize an economic contribution of $7300-$103 900 per pair of medical learners per placement.


INTRODUCTION
The RHOXF2 candidate gene belongs to the RHOX family clustered in Xq24 and is specifically expressed in the testis.

METHODS
The four exons in each of RHOXF2 and RHOXF2B were sequenced in 47 patients with oligospermia or non-obstructive azoospermia.
Given that exons 2 and 3 were found to harbour most of the SNPs, only these two exons were sequenced in the remaining 280 subjects.

RESULTS
CONCLUSION/OUTLOOK
RHOXF2 is a good candidate for rapid evolution by positive selection.
Analysis of the polymorphism frequency in exons 2 and 3 did not allow us to correlate the identified SNPs with male infertility.
However, a single nucleotide insertion was identified only in men with impaired spermatogenesis.


MEASUREMENTS AND METHODS
Responses were obtained using a 9-point Likert scale.
The survey was designed and pre-tested to evaluate duration and ease of administration.

RESULTS
One hundred and forty one (25% response rate) physicians participated in the survey.
The majority were from urban, academic centres and practiced in regionally administered renal programs.
Very few respondents had a formal policy regarding the timing of dialysis initiation or formally reviewed new dialysis starts (N = 4, 3.1%).
The majority of respondents were either neutral or disagreed that late compared to early dialysis initiation improved outcomes (85-88%), had a negative impact on quality of life (89%), worsened AVF or PD use (84-90%), led to sicker patients (83%) or was cost effective (61%).

LIMITATIONS
25% response rate.


MEASUREMENTS
A 75% agreement threshold was required for consensus.

RESULTS
The literature review produced 31 patient safety parameters.
Individual review by panelists reduced the list to 25 parameters, followed by further reduction to 19 at the in-person consensus meeting.
Revision using human factors principles incorporated the 19 patient safety parameters with greater than or equal to 75% consensus into a final checklist of 17-items.

LIMITATIONS
The literature review was not systematic.


INTRODUCTION
We undertook this study to understand the indications and duration of intravenous vancomycin in a rural setting.

RESULTS
Vancomycin was used intravenously in 180 patients during the study period.

CONCLUSION
Further study on clinical severity and antibiotic choice is needed.


METHODS
For both tuberculosis and HIV, we implemented mass screening of inmates and community-based screening of those residing in encampments adjacent to prisons.
We improved infection control measures, increased diagnostic capacity and promoted awareness of tuberculosis in Zambia's prisons.

FINDINGS
In a period of 9 months, we screened 7638 individuals and diagnosed 409 new patients with tuberculosis.
We tested 4879 individuals for HIV and diagnosed 564 cases of infection.
An additional 625 individuals had previously been found to be HIV-positive.
Overall, 22.9% of the inmates and 13.8% of the encampment residents were HIV-positive.

CONCLUSION
Both tuberculosis and HIV infection are common within Zambian prisons.
We enhanced tuberculosis screening and improved the detection of tuberculosis and HIV in this setting.


METHODS
We extracted data from prospective controlled trials and assessed the risk of bias.
We narratively synthesized evidence.

FINDINGS
However, the reductions only represented marginal changes in the total expenditures of patients.

CONCLUSION
In general, interventions designed to reduce the complex household economic burden of illness and injury appear to have had little impact on household economies.
We only found a few relevant studies using rigorous study designs that were conducted in defined patient populations.
The studies were limited in the range of interventions tested and they evaluated only a narrow range of household economic outcomes.


APPROACH
The national tuberculosis programme and Health Alliance International introduced rapid testing of smear-negative sputum samples.
Samples were tested using a polymerase-chain-reaction-based assay that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid and a mutation indicating rifampicin resistance; Xpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert®).
Four machines were deployed in four public hospitals along with a sputum transportation system to transfer samples from selected health centres.
Laboratory technicians were trained to operate the machines and clinicians taught to interpret the results.

LOCAL SETTING
Of tuberculosis patients, 58% are HIV-infected.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Rifampicin resistance was detected in 58/1081 (5%) of the samples.
However, treatment was started in only 82% of patients diagnosed by microscopy and 67% of patients diagnosed with the rapid test.

LESSONS LEARNT
Using rapid tests to diagnose tuberculosis is promising but logistically challenging.
More affordable and durable platforms are needed.


METHODS
A meta-analysis of study results was performed using a random-effects model to take account of heterogeneity.

FINDINGS
The analysis included 103 studies evaluating 135 cohorts of participants.
Most participants, 62.4%, had no therapeutic misconceptions and 54.9% could name at least one risk.

CONCLUSION
The proportion of participants in clinical trials who understood different components of informed consent varied from 52.1% to 75.8%.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey of hospital pharmacists from across Canada was conducted intermittently over the period August 2012 to September 2013.
All data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially.

RESULTS
In total, 401 surveys were returned.
Descriptive analyses from the Organizational Culture Profile revealed that most respondents perceived value in the factors of supportiveness, competitiveness, and stability.

CONCLUSIONS
The results from this survey provide preliminary insight into the professional culture and personality traits of Canadian hospital pharmacists.


INTRODUCTION
Resting heart (pulse) rate (RPR) monitoring may be a useful neurological assessment tool in chiropractic practice.
However, the clinical significance of short-term changes in RPR remains unknown.

RESULTS
Mean RPR change in the low baseline group was -0.3 BPM (95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.7 to 2.1 BPM) whereas in the high baseline group, it was +4.4 BPM (95% CI = 1.2 to 7.6).

CONCLUSION
In this pilot study, a higher RPR at baseline was associated with increased RPR change, whereas a lower baseline RPR was associated with a stable or reduced RPR change.


INTRODUCTION
The centre's service area includes 4 rural municipalities and 28 First Nations communities.

RESULTS
Overall, 81% of the clients successfully completed the program.
Two weeks after discharge, 48% of clients reported continued abstinence.
At 3-month follow-up, 32% were abstinent, and at 6 months, 30% were abstinent.

CONCLUSION
The MWSS shows positive outcomes for many clients, their families and communities.


METHODS
We reviewed HIV policies as part of a multi-country study on adult mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.
A policy extraction tool was developed and used to review national HIV policy documents and guidelines published in Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe between 2003 and 2013.
Key informant interviews helped to fill gaps in findings.
We also compared the national policies with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance.

FINDINGS
Malawi was particularly advanced in promoting rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy.
However, no country had a consistently enabling policy context expected to increase access to care and prevent attrition.
Countries went beyond WHO guidance in certain areas and key informants reported that practice often surpassed policy.

CONCLUSION
Certain policies will exert more influence than others and official policies are not always implemented.


METHODS
Poisson regression models were used to assess trends in smoking behaviour before and after the policy changes.

FINDINGS
The decline in the target group was 2.9% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.18 to 5.00) greater.

CONCLUSION
Further interventions targeting older individuals and frequent smokers may be needed.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the absolute wealth of households using data from demographic and health surveys.

METHODS
Using data from 156 demographic and health surveys in 66 countries, we calculated absolute wealth estimates for households.
We validated the method by comparing the proportion of households defined as poor using our estimates with published World Bank poverty headcounts.
We also compared the accuracy of absolute versus relative wealth estimates for the prediction of anthropometric measures.

FINDINGS
Absolute wealth estimates were better predictors of anthropometric measures than relative wealth indexes.


APPROACH
We customized training in rabies control methods for African professionals and students from different disciplines.
Trainees and mentors continued to interact through an online forum up to one year after the workshop.

RELEVANT CHANGES
An online forum facilitated further progress for a year after the workshop.

LESSONS LEARNT
Participation in this course enabled trainees to advocate for the development of national disease-control strategies.
Mentoring is needed to develop a strong network of experts in similar settings.


METHODS
We compared several models for imputing missing country-level incidence rates for two foodborne diseases - congenital toxoplasmosis and aflatoxin-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
Missing values were assumed to be missing at random.
Predictor variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression.
We compared the predictive performance of naive extrapolation approaches and Bayesian random and mixed-effects regression models.
Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to evaluate model accuracy.

FINDINGS
The predictive accuracy of the Bayesian mixed-effects models was significantly better than that of the naive extrapolation method for one of the two disease models.

CONCLUSION
Several approaches are available for imputing missing data at national level.
Strengths of a hierarchical regression approach for this type of task are the ability to derive estimates from other similar countries, transparency, computational efficiency and ease of interpretation.
The inclusion of informative covariates may improve model performance, but results should be appraised carefully.


METHODS
Data on funding of the facility were also collected.

FINDINGS
Quality-assured tuberculosis drugs supplied by the Global Drug Facility were generally priced lower than drugs purchased in the private sector.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria provided 73% (US$ 32.5 million of US$ 44.5 million) and 89% (US$ 57.8 million of US $65.2 million) of funds for first- and second-line drugs, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The price of tuberculosis drugs supplied through the facility was generally less than that on the private market.


METHODS
We calculated age-specific and age-standardized mortality rates for external causes of death.

FINDINGS
Postmortem reports revealed 52,493 injury-related deaths in 2009 (95% confidence interval, CI: 46,930-58,057).
Almost half (25,499) were intentionally inflicted.

CONCLUSION
This is the first nationally representative sample of injury-related mortality in South Africa.


METHODS
We documented sampling methods at the level of clusters, households and individual children.
We also assessed the length of training for field teams at national and regional levels, the composition of teams and the supervision provided.

FINDINGS
The surveys were conducted in Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Swaziland, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

CONCLUSION
For surveys conducted after supplementary immunization, a standard protocol is required.


METHODS
We conducted multistage stratified random face-to-face surveys of patients visiting community health centres in Shanghai in 2011 and 2013, and Shenzhen in 2012 and 2013.
Quality of primary care was measured using an assessment tool.
Difference-in-difference analyses based on multiple linear regressions were used to compare the changes over time, after controlling for potential confounders.

FINDINGS
The mean total scores for quality of primary care were similar for Shanghai and Shenzhen at baseline.
In Shenzhen, the mean total scores for all participants and those on low incomes had worsened by 0.922 (95% CI: 0.629 to 1.215) and 1.203 (95% CI: 0.397 to 2.009), respectively.

CONCLUSION
The quality of primary care improved in Shanghai but not in Shenzhen.


METHODS
The study was conducted in 2014.
Hospitals with at least 50 acute care beds were invited to participate.
The samples were analyzed for the presence of cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and methotrexate by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technology.
The limits of detection were 0.36 pg/cm(2) for cyclophosphamide, 0.95 pg/cm(2) for ifosfamide, and 0.97 pg/cm(2) for methotrexate.
Descriptive statistical analyses were performed to determine the median, 75th percentile, and maximum levels.

RESULTS
Fifty-one hospitals participated in this descriptive study, and a total of 584 samples were quantified.
Overall, 294 (50%) of the samples were positive for cyclophosphamide, 125 (21%) for ifosfamide, and 54 (9%) for methotrexate.
The 75th percentiles for surface concentration were 10.8 pg/cm(2) for cyclophosphamide, 1.59 pg/cm(2) for ifosfamide, and below the limit of detection for methotrexate.

CONCLUSIONS
Relative to 3 other multicentre studies conducted in Quebec over the past few years, the proportion of positive samples remained constant.
Nonetheless, the 75th percentile surface concentration of antineoplastic drugs has been decreasing and seems to have reached a plateau.


OBJECTIVE
Few studies have addressed the links between sedentary behaviour (SED) and mental health in youth.
Most studies on physical activity (PA) and SED examine their independent effects on mental health, or fail to account for PA in this relationship.

METHODS
Self-reported variables of demographics, PA, screen time, and mental health indicators were also collected.

RESULTS
Using logistic regression, screen time was inversely associated with all mental health indicators (p<.05).
An interaction between screen time and PA with low self-esteem was found only in males.

CONCLUSION
High screen time was associated with poorer mental health and academic outcomes.
These results confirm the value in distinguishing the independent and interactive effects of PA and SED on mental health.
Future research should promote PA and reduce screen time to improve mental health outcomes among youth.


OBJECTIVE
The core features of DMDD are temper outbursts (manifested by either verbal rages and/or physical aggression) and unrelenting irritability or anger.
Currently, the literature is lacking a thorough review of the possible treatment options for the cardinal symptoms constituting DMDD.
The objective of this article is to provide a thorough review of peer-reviewed studies on the subject of pharmacological treatment options for children and adolescents with the cardinal symptoms of DMDD.

METHODS
A total of 823 studies were generated; only English studies focusing on pharmacological treatment were retained.

CONCLUSION
Further studies and clinical trials are warranted to determine efficacious and safe treatment modalities.


METHODS
We conducted an interpretive phenomenology study of young people with recent experience of taking antipsychotics.
Youth were interviewed and a staged approach was used for data analysis of transcriptions.
We collected approximately 13 hours of audio from 18 youth aged 13 to 26 years between January and August of 2010.

RESULTS
Ambivalence was significant and antipsychotic adverse effects frequently tempered benefits.

CONCLUSIONS
The lived experience of youth taking antipsychotics is complex and the benefits (e.g., symptom improvement) and consequences (e.g., adverse effects) associated with antipsychotics affect all facets of life.


OBJECTIVES
Canadian Frailty Observation and

Interventions
Trial (CanFIT).

MEASUREMENTS
Location of dialysis initiation: in-center dialysis, home dialysis; or peritoneal dialysis outcomes: death, refusal or loss to follow-up.


OBJECTIVE
Maternal stress during pregnancy (MSDP) has been linked to a decrease in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in the general population.

METHODS
IQ was assessed using the WISC III and IV.
Symptom severity was evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Connor's Global Index for Parents (CGI-P) and Teachers (CGI-T).

RESULTS
No significant effect of MSDP on full scale IQ was observed, but MSDP had a significant effect on CBCL and CGI scores.


OBJECTIVE
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and disability in children and adolescents.
Psychopathology is an established risk factor for, and a frequent consequence of, TBI.
This paper reviews the literature relating psychopathology and TBI.

RESULTS
The risk of sustaining a TBI is increased by pre-existing psychopathology (particularly ADHD and aggression) and psychosocial adversity.
Few individuals receive treatment for mental illness following TBI.

CONCLUSION
TBI has substantial relevance to mental health professionals and their clinical practice.
Available evidence, while limited, indicates that the risk for TBI in children and adolescents is increased in the presence of several, potentially treatable mental health conditions and that the outcome of TBI involves a range of mental health problems, many of which are treatable.
Prevention and management efforts targeting psychiatric risks and outcomes are an urgent priority.
Child and adolescent mental health professionals can play a critical role in the prevention and treatment of TBI through advocacy, education, policy development and clinical practice.


OBJECTIVE
ADHD and asthma are prevalent conditions in childhood, with complex pathophysiology involving genetic-environmental interplay.
The study objective is to examine the prevalence of asthma in our ADHD population and explore factors that may increase the risk of developing asthma in children with ADHD.

RESULTS
Chi-square analysis indicated significant higher presence of asthma in our ADHD sample compared to Quebec children, χ(2)(1, N = 201) = 15.37, P<0.001.

CONCLUSION
Children with ADHD have a higher prevalence of asthma than the general Quebec pediatric population.
Children with ADHD born prematurely and/or those whose mothers experienced stress during pregnancy have a significantly increased risk of developing asthma.
The study highlights the importance of potentially offering social and psychological support to mothers who experienced stress during pregnancy and/or are at risk of delivering prematurely.


DESIGN
A retrospective cohort study including children aged <13 years diagnosed with culture-confirmed TB at Tygerberg Children's Hospital from July 2007 to June 2009.
Data on demographic, clinical and referral factors were collated from hospital data sources.
Electronic matching was used to identify children in the provincial ETR.Net.

RESULTS
Only 166 of 267 (62%) children were registered in ETR.Net.

CONCLUSIONS
Routine surveillance of childhood TB should include linkage of hospital data.


METHODS
A representative sample of 30 treatment units was randomly selected.

RESULTS
Treatment was successful in 89.4%.
Prescriptions of tablets/vials conforming to recommendations were found for respectively 91.2%, 89.9%, 92.3% and 94.6% of the patients for RMP/isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin.

CONCLUSIONS
Adherence to national recommendations was high.


DESIGN
SAM was defined as weight for height < -3 Z scores of the median and/or MUAC <115 mm.
SCM was defined as height for age < -3 Z scores of the median.
World Health Organization growth standards were used as reference.

RESULTS
Among the 322 children with SAM, 162 (50%) also had SCM.

CONCLUSION
In an urban Bangladesh slum, SAM and SCM co-exist, with a predominance of SCM.


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE
In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) published revised dosage recommendations for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in children.
In addition, countries were asked to provide 2010 surveillance data on childhood TB.

RESULTS
Among the 34 countries that responded to the survey, the proportion of total national TB caseload reported in children in 2010 ranged from 0.67% to 23.6%.
Most countries had childhood TB guidelines in place, and half had adopted the new dosage recommendations.
Countries reported a number of challenges related to the implementation of the new recommendations and general management of childhood TB.

CONCLUSIONS
Despite the adoption of the new dosage recommendations, their implementation is complicated by the lack of appropriate fixed-dose combinations.
Technical assistance and support to countries is needed to improve childhood TB activities.


METHODS
In a prospective nested case-control study, relapse cases were recruited from a cohort of pulmonary TB patients registered between July 2007 and June 2008.
Four controls per case were randomly selected from the list of non-relapse patients.
Three forms were used for data collection, which included interviews with the participants and review of their medical cards and TB registers.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for relapse.

RESULTS
A relapse rate of 5.7% was found.

CONCLUSION
Reinforcing the implementation of the DOTS strategy and strengthening the anti-smoking campaigns are important actions.
Using rifampicin-based regimens in the treatment of cavitary TB and bi-directional screening in TB and diabetes patients are recommended.


DESIGN
The study included 1068 TB patients registered for treatment at 10 laboratories from May 2010 to December 2011, and 910 healthy neighbourhood controls.
Weight (in kg), height (in cm) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC; in cm) were measured before, at 2 months and immediately after completion of treatment.
Body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m(2) and MUAC < 22.0 cm were taken as cut-offs for defining malnourishment.

RESULTS
MUAC < 22.0 cm was higher among patients before (42%), at 2 months (39%) and immediately after completion of treatment (34%) compared to the control group (9%).

CONCLUSIONS
Malnutrition is a serious problem among TB patients in peri-urban areas of Dhaka City.


OBJECTIVE
To identify TB exposed children through the implementation of a child contact register (CCR).

METHODS
Data were retrospectively analyzed.

RESULTS
In 12 months, the CCR revealed 580 children exposed to TB.
Of these, 58% were exposed to smear-positive TB and 30% were aged <5 years.
Of those exposed to smear-positive TB, 15% may have qualified for IPT initiation.
Only 6 (1%) child contacts were screened for TB disease.
More than 50% of the children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive mothers had not been HIV tested.


OBEJCTIVE
To assess the feasibility and results of TB-DM bidirectional screening.

RESULTS
Of 510 TB patients, 32 (6.3%) had been previously diagnosed with DM.
Screening among the remaining 478 patients yielded 15 (2.9%) with pre-diabetes and 15 (2.9%) newly diagnosed cases of DM.
A higher prevalence of DM was found among patients aged ≥40 years, patients with pulmonary TB and smokers.
Of the 47 TB-DM patients, 45 were enrolled in DM care.
Of 1670 DM patients followed up in DM clinics, 45 already had TB.
Among the remaining 1625 patients screened, 152 (9%) had symptoms suggestive of TB; two of these were found to have the disease.

CONCLUSION
Bidirectional screening for DM and TB is feasible and produces a high yield for DM among TB patients.


DESIGN
From January to September 2012, all TB patients were assessed for DM.
Those with fasting blood glucose (FBG) ≥ 126 mg/dl (≥7 mM) were diagnosed as DM-positive.

RESULTS
All new DM patients were enrolled into DM care.
Higher DM prevalence was found among TB patients aged ≥40 years, smokers and those with smear-positive pulmonary TB.
To detect a new case of DM, the number needed to screen (NNS) among TB patients was 40.

CONCLUSION
Screening of TB patients for DM was feasible and effective in a peripheral setting.
The study has contributed towards a national policy decision in this regard.


METHODS
We used laboratory data over a 2-year period to identify inpatient and outpatient cases of C. difficile infection.
Data were collected from 3 local catchment areas for rural hospital laboratories in Sioux Lookout, Mount Forest and the South Huron Hospital Association in Exeter.

RESULTS
During the study period, 34 cases of C. difficile infection occurred in 29 patients, with an estimated crude annual rate of 24.3/100,000 population.
Of the cases, 47.1% were diagnosed in outpatients.
Most patients (76.5%) had taken antibiotics within the previous 90 days, and antibiotic use and hospital admission accounted for 47.1% of cases.
Clindamycin was more commonly associated with C. difficile infections at the northern site and ciprofloxacin at the southern sites.
There were 2 deaths from comorbidities.

CONCLUSION
The estimated annual incidence of C. difficile infection in our study is similar to urban-based estimates.


METHODS
We performed a cross-sectional, analytic study at a Honduran medical school.
We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals.

RESULTS
Of 868 surveys distributed, 564 were completed.
The mean age of the participants was 21 (standard deviation 3) years, and 62.2% were female.
Of the respondents, 16.6% intended to emigrate to work and 11.2% intended to work in a rural setting.
Higher paternal education (i.e., technical, university and postgraduate training) was associated with a higher rate of intention to emigrate.
Students whose fathers underwent postgraduate education were less likely to intend to work in a rural setting.
For maternal education, only the postgraduate level was associated with the outcomes in some of the tested models.

CONCLUSION
The frequency of students intending to emigrate was relatively low.
However, the frequency of students being willing to work in rural settings was also low.
Students whose parents had higher levels of education were more likely to intend to work abroad and less likely to intend to work in a rural area.


METHODS
Descriptive statistics were used for all outcomes assessed.

RESULTS
For the remaining 11 patients, dabigatran therapy did not meet prescribing restrictions for use because of valvular disease or presence of prosthetic valve (10 patients [14% of the total sample]) and impaired renal function (1 patient [1%]).
Stroke and bleeding risk were documented for only 27 patients (47%) and 10 patients (17%), respectively.

CONCLUSION
However, greater consideration of cardiac history (including valvular disease and presence of prosthetic valves), drug interactions, and documentation of risks and benefits is warranted.


METHODS
Factors associated with adequate monitoring were analysed using regression methods.
The costs of the tests were estimated.

FINDINGS
The cost of one CD4+ cell count ranged from 7.37 United States dollars (US$) in Argentina to US$ 64.09 in Chile; the cost of one viral load measurement ranged from US$ 20.34 in Brazil to US$ 186.28 in Haiti.

CONCLUSION
The laboratory costs of monitoring varied greatly.


METHODS
The following parameters were measured: free and total residual chlorine, temperature, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity and oxidation reduction potential.
We documented water handling practices with spot checks and respondent self-reports.
We analysed factors affecting residual chlorine concentrations using mathematical and linear regression models.

FINDINGS
Regression models showed that the decay of residual chlorine was related to initial chlorine levels, electrical conductivity and air temperature.

CONCLUSION
According to our findings, this would ensure a free residual chlorine level of 0.2 mg/L for at least 10 hours after distribution.


METHODS
We also obtained reports from Abt Associates, through contacts in individual countries and through an online search.
We combined and adjusted data to conform with OECD's first edition of A system of health accounts manual, (2000).

FINDINGS
All study data are publicly available at http://vizhub.healthdata.org/nha/.

CONCLUSION
Data from NHA reports on health expenditure are often incomplete and, in some cases, of questionable quality.


METHODS
The analyser performs a series of checks to ensure that all steps of the analysis are completed successfully; if not, an invalid result is reported.
We calculated the proportion of invalid results by device and by operator.
Regression analyses were used to investigate factors associated with invalid results.

FINDINGS
The median proportion of errors per device and operator was 12.7% (interquartile range, IQR: 10.3-19.9) and 12.1% (IQR: 7.1-19.2), respectively.
The proportion of invalid results varied widely by country, setting, user and device.
Errors were not associated with settings, user experience or the number of users per device.
Tests performed on capillary blood samples were significantly less likely to generate errors compared to venous whole blood.

CONCLUSION
The Alere Pima CD4+ analyser generated a high proportion of invalid test results, across different countries, settings and users.


METHODS
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the three programmes were estimated from a government perspective.
Cost data were collected for 2012.
Life years gained were estimated based on coverage of reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health services.
For Ethiopia and Kenya, estimates of coverage before and after the implementation of the programme were obtained from empirical studies.
For Indonesia, coverage of health service interventions was estimated from routine data.
We used the Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of lives saved from changes in reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health-service coverage.
Gross domestic product per capita was used as the reference willingness-to-pay threshold value.

FINDINGS
The estimated incremental cost per life year gained was 82 international dollars ($)in Kenya, $999 in Ethiopia and $3396 in Indonesia.

CONCLUSION
Community-based practitioners may be most appropriate in rural poor communities that have limited access to more qualified health professionals.


METHODS
We included studies reporting the development or use of data collection tools concerning the health of women and children in humanitarian emergencies.
We used narrative synthesis to summarize the studies.

FINDINGS
We identified 100 studies: 80 reported on conflict situations and 20 followed natural disasters.
Most studies (76/100) focused on the health status of the affected population while 24 focused on the availability and coverage of health services.
Sixty-nine studies were done for monitoring and evaluation purposes, 18 for advocacy, seven for operational research and six for needs assessment.

CONCLUSION
Practical and effective means of data collection are needed to inform life-saving actions in humanitarian emergencies.


METHODS
Observers recorded the use of uterotonic medicines, controlled cord traction and uterine massage.
Facility infrastructure and supplies needed for active management were audited and relevant guidelines reviewed.

FINDINGS
Most (94%; 2173) of the women observed were given oxytocin (2043) or another uterotonic (130).
Of the women given a uterotonic, 1640 (76%) received it within three minutes of the birth.
Uterotonics and related supplies were generally available onsite.

CONCLUSION
In the study countries, quality and coverage of the active management of the third stage of labour were high.
Training on the use of new clinical guidelines and implementation research on the best methods to update such training are also needed.


METHODS
Health-care providers were trained to use the cards to record details of contraception given to women.
After one year, the family planning cards were collected for analysis.

FINDINGS
Of the 7393 eligible women, 6861 (92.8%) received a family planning card and 4678 (63.3%) returned it after one year.

CONCLUSION
The involvement of health-care providers was key to the success of this approach.


METHODS
We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, from a societal perspective, that included probabilistic uncertainty.
We measured early treatment outcomes based on three-month culture results and modelled longer-term outcomes to facilitate estimation of the comprehensive programme's cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted.

FINDINGS
The comprehensive programme cost 8837 United States dollars (US$) per patient treated.
Low enrolment rates meant that some fixed costs were higher, per patient, than expected.

CONCLUSION
To support post-2015 global heath targets, the comprehensive programme should be expanded to non-residents and other areas of China.


APPROACH
However, in 2011, a national eHealth policy was implemented.

LOCAL SETTING
Bangladesh has made substantial improvements to its health system.

RELEVANT CHANGES
A government operated telemedicine service was initiated and by 2014, 43 fully equipped centres were in service.
These centres provide medical consultations by qualified physicians to patients visiting rural and remote community clinics and union health centres.

LESSONS LEARNT
Despite early pilot interventions and successful implementation, progress in adopting eHealth strategies in Bangladesh has been slow.
Limited internet bandwidth and the high cost of infrastructure and software development are barriers to adoption of these technologies.


METHODS
We enrolled patients with achalasia in a research ethics board-approved pilot study.
All patients underwent gastrograffin swallow on postoperative day 1.

RESULTS
Ten patients underwent POEM.
Seven patients had previous endoscopic treatments: 6 had balloon dilatation and 1 had botulinum toxin injection.
Mean preoperative Eckhardt score was 8.1 ± 2.4.
Mean preoperative lower esophageal sphincter resting and residual pressure was 32.3 ± 9.2 and 20.8 ± 5.3, respectively.
Mean duration of surgery was 141.3 ± 43.7 minutes.
Mean length of hospital stay was 1 day.
No major perioperative complications occurred.
On postoperative day 14, the mean Eckhardt score was 1 ± 1.2.

CONCLUSION
Our approach to POEM introduction was systematic and deliberate.
Our early results are consistent with current literature.


METHODS
We obtained a list of new molecular entities (new pharmaceutical products) approved by the FDA in 2011 and 2012.
FDA medical reviews indicated the countries where pivotal clinical trials had been conducted.
Information on safety and efficacy was gathered from independent drug bulletins.

FINDINGS
Eight products were registered and commercialized in all countries but 10 had not been registered in any of the countries.

CONCLUSION
Many pharmaceutical products tested in Latin America are unavailable and/or unaffordable to most of the population.
Finally, clinical trials have opportunity costs that need to be assessed.


PROBLEM
Before 2003 there was substantial underreporting of deaths in Jordan.

LOCAL SETTING
Approximately 20 000 deaths were registered per year between 2005 and 2011.

RELEVANT CHANGES
In 2001, the ministry of health organized the first meeting on Jordan's mortality system, which yielded a five-point plan to improve mortality statistics.
Mortality information is now submitted to WHO following international standards.


APPROACH
We created an international partnership between Zambian clinicians, the Zambian Government and a pharmaceutical company to address shortcomings in asthma treatment.
We did two studies, one to estimate prevalence in the capital of Lusaka and one to assess attitudes and practices of patients.
Based on the information obtained, we educated health workers and the public.
The information from the studies was also used to modernize government policy for paediatric asthma management.

LOCAL SETTING
Comprehensive services for noncommunicable diseases are lacking.
Asthma management relies on treatment of acute exacerbations instead of disease control.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Seven percent of children surveyed had asthma (255/3911).
Of the 120 patients interviewed, most (82/120, 68%) used oral short-acting β2-agonists for symptom control; almost half (59/120, 49%) did not think the symptoms were preventable and 43% (52/120) thought inhalers were addictive.
These misconceptions informed broad-based educational programmes.
We used a train-the-trainer model to educate health-care workers and ran public awareness campaigns.

LESSONS LEARNT
Joint activities were required to change paediatric asthma care in Zambia.


METHODS
The 17 questions were designed to gather information on preceptors' demographic characteristics and their expectations and evaluations of the combined-program students.
Responses were analyzed qualitatively for common themes and quantitatively using sums and means.
Survey responses were compared to identify alignment and discrepancies between preceptors' expectations and evaluations of students.

RESULTS
The survey response rate was 48% (63/132).
Most respondents (46 [73%]) were from a teaching hospital, and the same proportion (46 [73%]) reported being preceptors for a direct patient care rotation.
According to survey responses, 31% of respondents (18/58) ranked students at the corresponding level of performance on the faculty's assessment form, while 62% (36/58) ranked students at a higher level (5 respondents did not complete the question).
Only one-third of respondents felt that they personally had received adequate training before taking on preceptor duties for combined-program students.

CONCLUSIONS
There was a disconnect between preceptor-specific expectations and preceptors' final evaluations of students.


METHODS
We assessed the national civil registration and vital statistics system's legal framework, administrative structure and design through document review.
We interviewed registrars, medical officers and coders in Punjab state to assess their knowledge and practice.

FINDINGS
A medically certified cause of death was only recorded for 965,992 (16.8%) of the 5,735,082 deaths registered.

CONCLUSION
The data recorded by India's civil registration and vital statistics system in 2011 were incomplete.
If improved, the system could be used to reliably estimate mortality.


METHODS
We extracted information on cause of death, age, sex, ethnicity and place of residence from the nationwide mortality information system at the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
We selected deaths in which the underlying cause of death was a neglected tropical disease (NTD), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and based on its International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes.
For specific NTDs, we estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and mortality rate ratios by age, sex, ethnicity and geographic area.

FINDINGS
Over the 12-year study period, 12 491 280 deaths were recorded; 76 847 deaths (0.62%) were caused by NTDs.
Chagas disease was the most common cause of death (58 928 deaths; 76.7%), followed by schistosomiasis (6319 deaths; 8.2%) and leishmaniasis (3466 deaths; 4.5%).

CONCLUSION
NTDs are important causes of death and are a significant public health problem in Brazil.


METHODS
We extracted data on iodized household salt from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys conducted in 2000 and 2010.
We explored associations between these indices and socioeconomic variables, both within and between countries.

FINDINGS
Improvements in coverage were higher in rural areas and among the poorest households, but within-country socioeconomic disparities remained.
There were weak associations between changes in salt iodization and national level socioeconomic indicators.

CONCLUSION
However, the changes varied widely among countries.


METHODS
We included programmatic reports and hand-searched references of published reviews and articles.
Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data on carers, health system characteristics and contextual factors.
We developed a conceptual model to analyse the integration of kangaroo mother care in health systems.

FINDINGS
We screened 2875 studies and included 112 studies that contained qualitative data on implementation.
Kangaroo mother care was applied in different ways in different contexts.
Barriers within health systems included organization, financing and service delivery.
In the broad context, cultural norms influenced perceptions and the success of adoption.

CONCLUSION
Success of implementation requires high user engagement and stakeholder involvement.


PROBLEM
New drugs for infectious diseases often need to be evaluated in low-resource settings.

APPROACH
We carried out a capacity-building programme during a multi-centre randomized controlled trial of delamanid, a new drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

LOCAL SETTING
Eight of the 10 sites in low-resource settings had no experience in conducting the requisite clinical trials.


METHODS
In regression analyses, we investigated associations between the normalized rates of change in population access and national socioeconomic indicators: gross national income per capita, government effectiveness, official development assistance, freshwater resources, education, poverty, Gini coefficient, child mortality and the human development index.

FINDINGS
However, only about a third showed a level of progress that was at least half the maximum achievable level.
The normalized rates of change did not appear to be correlated with any of the national indicators that we investigated.

CONCLUSION
In many countries, the progress being made towards universal access to improved drinking water and sanitation is falling well short of the maximum achievable level.
Progress does not appear to be correlated with a country's social and economic characteristics.


INTRODUCTION
Primary Care Physicians (PCP) play a key role in the recognition and management of child/adolescent mental health struggles.

METHODS
From a Canadian national needs assessment survey, PCPs' narrative comments were examined using quantitative and qualitative approaches.

RESULTS
Out of 909 PCPs completing the survey, 39.38% (n = 358) wrote comments.


MEASUREMENTS
The primary outcome was the 30-day risk of hospitalization with hyponatremia.

RESULTS
A total of 104 baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two matched groups.
The limited number of events precluded some additional analyses to confirm if the association was robust.

CONCLUSIONS
The association was less pronounced than that described with other psychotropic drugs.


METHODS
We pooled records from 42 demographic and health surveys in 29 countries.
We used logistic regression models to determine the association between intimate partner violence and child stunting and wasting.

FINDINGS
Prior exposure to intimate partner violence was reported by 69 652 (34.1%) of the 204 159 ever-married women included in our analysis.
We also found a small negative association between wasting and intimate partner violence (aOR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.90-0.98).

CONCLUSION
Policy and programme efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence and impact of such violence.


OBJECTIVES
The secondary objectives included a comparison of the risk factors associated with major bleeding and thrombosis.

METHODS
Adult patients who received a renal transplant at St Paul's Hospital between January 2008 and July 2013 were included in this retrospective cohort study.
The Fisher exact test was used for the primary outcome analysis, and descriptive statistics were used for all other outcomes.

RESULTS
A total of 547 patients were included in the analysis.
Thrombosis occurred in 1 (0.4%) and 3 (1.1%) of these patients, respectively (p = 0.62).


OBJECTIVE
To estimate the population prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in Gambia.

METHODS
Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting were used to estimate tuberculosis prevalence.

FINDINGS
Of 100 678 people enumerated, 55 832 were eligible to participate and 43 100 (77.2%) of those participated.
A majority of participants (42 942; 99.6%) were successfully screened for symptoms and by chest X-ray.
The estimated prevalence of smear-positive and bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis were 90 (95% confidence interval, CI: 53-127) and 212 (95% CI: 152-272) per 100 000 population, respectively.
Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in males (333; 95% CI: 233-433) and in the 35-54 year age group (355; 95% CI: 219-490).


METHODS
We used data from a large, population-based vitamin A trial in 2010-2013, with 22 955 enrolled infants.

FINDINGS
Similar results were observed for DTP3.

CONCLUSION
Low-birth-weight infants are a high-risk group for delayed vaccination in Ghana.


METHODS
In a cross-sectional, retrospective study we used data from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) in 2012.
This contained self-reported information about antenatal care use by 6494 women during their last pregnancy ending in live birth.
We used multivariate ordinal logistic regression to identify correlates of adequate antenatal care and predicted coverage.

FINDINGS
Significant geographic differences in coverage of care were identified among states.

CONCLUSION
While basic antenatal care coverage is high in Mexico, adequate care remains low.


APPROACH
By 2005, the target coverage was 80% of households and the Global Fund financed the scale-up.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Between 2002 and 2012, 18 248 206 LLINs had been distributed.
The coverage of at least one LLIN per household increased from 27% (3689/13 664) to 58% (1974/3404).
Indoor residual spraying coverage increased from 28 227 to 653 592 structures between 2007 and 2011.
Malaria cases increased from 2 853 315 in 2002 to 6 748 535 in 2010, and thereafter dropped to 4 922 596 in 2012.

LESSONS LEARNT
A resistance management plan is essential for effective and sustainable vector control.


OBJECTIVE
Emerging technologies represent a promising new approach to deliver suicide prevention interventions to these populations.
The current systematic review aims to identify online and mobile psychosocial suicide prevention interventions for young people, and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions.

RESULTS
Two relevant protocol papers of studies currently underway were also identified.

CONCLUSIONS
There is a paucity of current evidence for online and mobile interventions for suicide prevention in youth.


OBJECTIVE
Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids have been shown to be deficient in individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder compared to controls (Hawkey & Nigg, 2014).
Clinical trials of omega-3 and omega-6 supplements as treatment for ADHD have demonstrated minimal efficacy (Bloch & Qawasmi, 2011; Gillies, Sinn, Lad, Leach, & Ross, 2011; Hawkey & Nigg, 2014; Puri & Martins, 2014; Sonuga-Barke et al.
, 2013).
Existing trials have analyzed omega-3 and omega-6 separately although the tissue ratio of these fatty acids (n6/n3) may be more important than absolute levels of either.
The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between blood n6/n3 and arachidonic acid to eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA), to ADHD symptoms.

RESULTS
Five articles met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
Children and youth with ADHD have elevated ratios of both blood n6/n3 and AA/EPA fatty acids compared to controls.
Thus an elevated n6/n3, and more specifically AA/EPA, ratio may represent the underlying disturbance in essential fatty acid levels in patients with ADHD.
These findings have implications for the development of future interventions using essential fatty acids to treat ADHD, and for the use of these ratios as biomarkers for titrating and monitoring ADHD treatment with essential fatty acids.


METHODS
The first initiative was to restrict the performance of biopsies to a smaller group of radiologists and to include a comment on biopsy adequacy in every pathology report.
The second initiative was to introduce on-site adequacy assessment by a medical laboratory technologist.
A subset of native renal biopsies was examined to determine if there was a relationship between adequacy and number of passes.

RESULTS
These changes in adequacy were not statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS
This improvement appeared unrelated to an increase in the number of passes taken with a biopsy needle.
Neither initiative improved the low adequacy of allograft biopsies.


METHODS
We identified institutions offering health policy and systems research training worldwide.
In 2014, we recruited participants from identified institutions for an online survey on the characteristics of the institutions and the courses given.
Survey findings were explored during in-depth interviews with selected key informants.

FINDINGS
The study identified several important gaps in health policy and systems research training.
There were few courses in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa or Latin America.
Most (116/152) courses were instructed in English.
Moreover, the lack of alternatives to on-site teaching may preclude certain student audiences such as policy-makers.

CONCLUSION
Training in health policy and systems research is important to improve local capacity to conduct quality research in this field.
We provide six recommendations to improve the content, accessibility and reach of training.
First, create a repository of information on courses.
Second, establish networks to support training.
Third, define competencies in health policy and systems research.
Fourth, encourage multidisciplinary collaboration.
Fifth, expand the geographical and language coverage of courses.
Finally, consider alternative teaching formats.


METHODS
The intervention in 2012-2013 was based on four components: awareness-raising; improved access to screening; standardized clinical management of hypertension; and long-term retention in care.
We also estimated the costs associated with implementation, using a top-down costing approach.

FINDINGS
The total intervention cost per patient with blood pressure controlled was US$ 3205.

CONCLUSION
However, retention in care and blood pressure control were challenges in this slum setting.
For patients, the costs and lack of time or forgetfulness were barriers to retention in care.


METHODS
We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis and estimated pooled rates of road traffic injuries and deaths.

FINDINGS
We identified 39 studies from 15 African countries.

CONCLUSION
The burden of road traffic injury and death is high in Africa.


METHODS
Document scores were rescaled using the Martin-Vanberg transformation to improve comparability.

FINDINGS
There was a small shift in transformed Wordscores score between the draft and final guidelines, from 0.25 to 0.24, towards the industry position.
The change was linked to increased use of the word "low" to describe the quality of the evidence, consistent with industry arguments.
There was also a shift from use of the word "consumption" to "intake", irrespective of policy position.

CONCLUSION
The main change was linked to emphasizing the low quality of the evidence on sugar's adverse effects.


METHODS
The data were combined to calculate new disability weights for each common injury classification and for each type of diagnosis covered by the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems.
Weights were calculated separately for hospital admissions and presentations confined to emergency departments.

FINDINGS
There were 29 770 injury cases with at least one EQ-5D score.
The mean age of the participants providing data was 51 years.
Most participants were male and almost a third had road traffic injuries.
Long-term disability was common in most categories of injuries.

CONCLUSION
Injury is often a chronic disorder and burden of disease estimates should reflect this.


METHODS
We contacted 21 maternity centres belonging to a paediatric cardiology network, with access to information regarding more than 100 000 neonates born between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2015.

FINDINGS
Between 1 and 31 December 2015, nurses obtained data for 16 208 neonates.
Two per cent (316) of the neonates fulfilled all three criteria.
We observed temporal fluctuations of microcephaly prevalence from late 2012.

CONCLUSION
More studies are needed to understand the epidemiology and the implications for the Brazilian health system.


METHODS
We collated data from administrative reports, population-based surveys and other sources and used them to produce annual estimates of vaccination coverage.
We investigated bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine, the first and third doses of vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, the third dose of oral polio vaccine and the first dose of vaccine against measles.
We obtained relevant data covering the period 1999-2013 for each of 16 states and territories and the period 2001-2013 for the state of Jharkhand - which was only created in 2000.
We aggregated the resultant state-level estimates, using a population-weighted approach, to give national values.

FINDINGS
The rest were based on interpolation between - or extrapolation from - so-called anchor points or, more rarely, on administrative data.

CONCLUSION
The delivery of routine vaccination services to Indian children appears to have improved between 1999 and 2013.


METHODS
We compared seven published real-time RT-PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed.
Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays.

FINDINGS
The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction.
Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples.
The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 × 104 RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 × 104 RNA copies/mL of urine.

CONCLUSION
We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains.


METHODS
In 2015, we used the Google search engine to investigate the 196 States Parties to the 2005 IHR.

FINDINGS
We collected relevant and non-conflicting data for each of 187 States Parties.

CONCLUSION
We identified 58 (31.0%) States Parties that exceeded or disregarded the recommendations.
There is a need for more research to understand and minimize deviations from such recommendations.


INTRODUCTION
The number of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been rapidly rising in the past decade.
The etiology of this disorder, however, is largely unknown, although the environmental relative to the genetic contribution is substantial.

RESULTS
We identified over 50 000 publications, but after ineligible studies were screened out, 315 articles remained.
Most of these studies examined physiological factors, followed closely by chemical factors, and to a much lesser extent, nutritional and social factors, associated with ASD.
Despite extensive research on vaccines, findings overwhelmingly demonstrate no support for an association with ASD.

CONCLUSION
More robust research is required to resolve inconsistencies in the literature.
Future research should explore underlying mechanisms of associations between the risk factors that we identified and ASD.


METHODS
Criteria used to select articles for detailed review included use of antegrade and retrograde entry point or use of trochanteric and piriformis entry point for IM nailing of the femur in adult patients.
Functional and technical outcomes were extracted from accepted studies.

RESULTS
We identified 483 potential studies, of which 52 were eligible.
Of these, we included 13 publications and 2 abstracts (2 level I, 7 level II and 6 level III studies).
Trochanteric entry significantly reduced operative duration by 14 min compared with piriformis entry (p = 0.030).
Retrograde nailing had a greater risk of postoperative knee pain than antegrade nailing (p = 0.05).
On the other hand, antegrade nailing had significantly more postoperative hip pain (p = 0.003) and heterotopic ossification (p < 0.001) than retrograde nailing.
No significant differences in functional outcomes were observed.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE
Level III therapeutic.


METHODS
We searched the Complex Emergency Database for nutrition surveys carried out in Ethiopia over the period 2000-2013.
Data on any conflict events (irrespective of magnitude or impact) and episodes of seasonal drought affecting the survey areas were extracted from publicly available data sources.
Random-effects Bayesian meta-analysis was used to synthesize the evidence from 231 small-scale surveys.

FINDINGS
From the total sample of 175 607 children analysed, the pooled number of children wasted was 21 709.
The posterior median prevalence of wasting was 11.0% (95% credible interval, CrI: 10.3-11.7) over the 14-year period.

CONCLUSION
Despite an overall declining trend, a wasting problem persists among children in Ethiopia.


APPROACH
Tuberculosis screening and testing were carried out in accordance with national guidelines.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Of those with tuberculosis, 270 (94%) initiated treatment.

LESSONS LEARNT
Follow-up during treatment was difficult in this highly mobile group and needs more attention in future interventions.


METHODS
We obtained data on drowning deaths and population statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and its predecessors for the period 1861 to 2000.
From these data, we calculated drowning death rates per 100 000 population per year, by gender and age.

FINDINGS
From 1861 to 2000, at least 18 070 people drowned in Victoria.

CONCLUSION
These findings may have relevance to current developing communities.


METHODS
We obtained data on the number of notified and confirmed microcephaly cases in each Brazilian state between November 2015 and October 2016 from the health ministry.
For Pernambuco State, one of the hardest hit, weekly data were available from August 2015 to October 2016 for different definitions of microcephaly.
The absolute risk of microcephaly was calculated using the average number of live births reported in each state in the corresponding time period between 2012 and 2014 and assuming two infection rates: 10% and 50%.
The relative risk was estimated using the reported background frequency of microcephaly in Brazil of 1.98 per 10 000 live births.

FINDINGS
For a 10% infection rate, the probability was 88-635 folds higher.

CONCLUSION
A large variation in the estimated risk of microcephaly was found in Brazil.


PROBLEM
Many countries have weak disease surveillance and immunization systems.

APPROACH
In 2003, the active surveillance system of Nepal's polio eradication programme began to report on measles and neonatal tetanus cases.
Japanese encephalitis and rubella cases were added to the surveillance system in 2004.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Staff have also assisted in responding to other health events in the country.


RESULTS
There were 47 responses, including almost every Canadian adult transplant program.
Most (81%) reported the use of a body mass index limit for access to the waiting list.
However, only 40% reported a strict enforcement.
The body mass index limit was most commonly 40 kg/m2 (62%), followed by 35 kg/m2 (36%).

LIMITATIONS
This national survey provides a broad assessment of clinical practice.
The distinction between an official policy and informal clinical tendencies is difficult.

CONCLUSIONS
Several inconsistencies suggest a lack of official policy.
To achieve equity in access, clear guidelines for obesity should be established and enforced.
Bariatric surgery has the promise of rapid weight loss.
Resource allocation to study obesity in transplant patients will be essential.


PRESENTING CONCERNS OF THE PATIENT
Chronic kidney disease resulted after the acute episode.

DIAGNOSES
Hemodialysis was started in 2012.

INTERVENTIONS
The patient underwent kidney transplantation from an HIV-positive donor in January 2016.
The recipient's antiretroviral regimen consisted of abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir.


METHODS
We confirmed the double substitution by the butyric groups using infrared spectrometry.
The fibrous scaffolds were obtained using the electrospinning method.
A polypropylene net was implanted subcutaneously in the rat and served as a wound model.

RESULTS
Both DBC and PCL increased granulation tissue weight in the wound.
In contrast to PCL, DBC did not abolish glycosaminoglycan changes in wounds.
The tested samples did not impair total collagen synthesis or induce excessive fibrosis.
In both PCL- and DBC-treated wounds, we observed a lower level of soluble collagen (compared with controls).
The results show better hydration of the wounds in both the DBC and PCL groups.
The implants increased the blood vessel number in a wound.

CONCLUSION
Both PCL and DBC could be used as scaffolds or dressings for wound treatment.
The materials were safe and well tolerated by animals.


OBJECTIVES
The aim of the present study was to describe the use of ECT in youth in Quebec City and obtain Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists' (CAP) perceptions in the province of Quebec.

METHODS
Data was also collected on CAP perceptions and experience of ECT use in youth by means of a survey (part 2).

RESULTS
The main diagnoses were: mood disorders and schizoaffective disorder.

CONCLUSION
Our results are consistent with the notion that ECT use in youth with a refractory and complex disease is a safe and effective treatment, although rarely used.


METHODS
Four interviews were also carried out with caregivers (three females and one male).
Thematic analysis of the focus group and interview transcripts was conducted.

RESULTS
Three key themes were identified in the focus group and interview data: Relationship as locus of change, Group process, and Psychoeducation-based content.
That the TAG program provides psychoeducation about the effects of trauma to caregiver/child dyads in a group setting appears important in supporting the effectiveness of the program.
Structured parent-child play and sensory activities together ("kit-time") were also highly valued.

CONCLUSIONS
Further evaluation may help to identify other components that contribute to the success of the program.


OBJECTIVE
Children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have some problems in social relationships which may be related to their deficit in recognizing emotional expressions.
It is not clear if the deficit in emotion recognition is secondary to core symptoms of ADHD or can be considered as an independent symptom.

METHODS
Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and Continuous Performance Test II (CPT II) were also administered to assess the severity of inattention and impulsivity.

RESULTS
The percentages of angry, happy and sad faces detected by children with ADHD were significantly lower (p<0.05) compared to the control group.
The time spent in recognizing happy faces was higher in the ADHD group (p=0.04).

CONCLUSION
This deficit may be related to inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.


INTRODUCTION
CANRISK was developed using data collected in seven Canadian provinces.

RESULTS
A total of 303 individuals participated in the study.
Half were aged less than 45 years, two-thirds were female and 84% were Inuit.
A total of 18% had prediabetes, and an additional 4% had undiagnosed diabetes.
The odds of having dysglycemia rose exponentially with age, while the relationship with BMI was U-shaped.
Compared with lab test results, using a cut-off point of 32 the CANRISK tool achieved a sensitivity of 61%, a specificity of 66%, a positive predictive value of 34% and an accuracy rate of 65%.

CONCLUSION
We found the CANRISK tool to be adaptable to the Kitikmeot region, and more generally to Nunavut.


RESULTS
Of 1512 included patients, 151 developed kidney failure over the 5-year follow-up period.
At a 3% threshold over 5 years, the KFRE had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 62%.
At 10% risk, sensitivity was 86%, and specificity was 80%.

LIMITATIONS
Only 11.7% of stage 3-5 CKD patients had simultaneous ACR measurement.

CONCLUSIONS
Thresholds of 3% and 10% over 5 years are sensitive, specific, and can be used in clinical decision making.


PROBLEM
Underutilization of mental health services is a major barrier to reducing the burden of disease attributable to mental, neurological and substance-use disorders.

APPROACH
In two districts in Nepal, we trained lay community informants to use a tool to detect people with mental, neurological and substance-use disorders during routine community service.
Informants referred people they identified using the tool to health-care facilities.

LESSONS LEARNT
The introduction of the tool increased the utilization of mental health services in a low-income country with few health resources.


METHODS
The secondary outcomes were length of stay, frequency of warfarin resistance, incidence and duration of bridging anticoagulation, incidence of thromboembolism and major bleeding, and death.

RESULTS
No statistically significant differences in any other outcomes were observed.

CONCLUSIONS
No significant differences were found in clinically important outcomes.


METHODS
Demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes and readmissions were analyzed using standard statistical methods.
All readmissions were categorized as per the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support 2015 guidelines.

RESULTS
Of the 103 patients who received LVADs during the study period, 37 received LVAD support for more than 1 year, with 18 receiving support for more than 2 years.
Average support time was 786 ± 381 days, with total support time reaching 80 patient-years.
During a median follow-up of 2 years, 27 patients died, with 1-year conditional survival of 74%.
Median freedom from first readmission was 106 days (range 1-603 d), with an average length of stay of 6 days.
Readmissions resulted in an average of 41 ± 76 days in hospital per patient.
Reasons for readmission were major infection (24%), major bleeding (19%) and device malfunction/thrombus (13%).
There were a total of 112 procedures completed during the readmissions, with 60% of procedures being done in 13% (n = 5) of patients.

CONCLUSION
Continuous-flow LVADs provide excellent long-term survival.


METHODS
Primary outcome measures were the incidence of staple line leaks and the results of Gastrografin swallow tests.

RESULTS
The sensitivity of Gastrografin swallow in this study was 33%.
For 200 patients, the total direct cost of the Gastrografin swallows was $35 000.

CONCLUSION
We recommend selective use of CT instead.


METHODS
Xpert® MTB/RIF (Xpert®), an automated polymerase-chain-reaction-based assay, was rolled out between 2011 and 2013.
Data were available on 102 007 adults treated for pulmonary tuberculosis between 2010 and 2014.

FINDINGS
Between 2010 and 2014, the proportion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients treated empirically for tuberculosis declined from 23% (2445/10 643) to 11% (1149/10 089); in HIV-positive patients, it declined from 42% (4229/9985) to 27% (2364/8823).
These changes occurred gradually following the test's introduction and stabilized after 3 years.

CONCLUSION
More than a quarter of HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis were still treated empirically, highlighting the diagnostic challenge in these patients.


APPROACH
In a project led by the health ministry, we adapted existing technologies to create an electronic platform for rabies surveillance.
Information is entered by trained clinical staff, and both aggregate and individual patient data are visualized in real time.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Laboratories rapidly communicated the results of rabies virus tests on dead mammals (328/907 positive).
In two pilot districts SMS reminders were sent to 1376 (71.2%) of 1933 patients whose contact details were available.

LESSONS LEARNT
Existing technologies in low-resource countries can be harnessed to improve public health surveillance.


PROBLEM
Lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis are the major causes of tropical lymphoedema in Ethiopia.

APPROACH
To establish health-care services for integrated lymphoedema morbidity management, the health ministry and partners used existing governmental structures.
Integrated disease mapping was done in 659 out of the 817 districts, to identify endemic districts.
To monitor the integration, an indicator on the number of lymphoedema-treated patients was included in the national health management information system.

LESSONS LEARNT
The processes used could be applicable in other settings where these diseases are co-endemic.


METHODS
A link to a web-based survey was posted in e-newsletters of provincial, territorial, and national pharmacy associations in Canada.
The survey was open from October to December 2015.
One response per practice or organization was allowed.

RESULTS
Although 12 (71%) of the respondents collected data for evaluative purposes, collection of clinical or health system outcome data was rare.

CONCLUSIONS
Few Canadian pharmacy practices that provide in-home patient care at least once a week could be identified.
Such evidence is needed to justify the expansion of this service nationally, including consistent and adequate remuneration from governments or other payers.


METHODS
Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between each of the four pregnancy desire categories and use of modern contraceptives.

RESULTS
Overall, 12% of women were classified as ambivalent, 32% as indifferent, 44% as antinatal and 12% as pronatal.

CONCLUSIONS
Ambivalent and indifferent pregnancy desires are common in Malawi and are associated with modern contraceptive use in different ways.
Understanding the complex nature of pregnancy desires may be valuable in improving family planning programs.


PURPOSE
Single-suture nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is diagnosed using clinical assessment and computed tomography (CT).

RESULTS
In total, 41 pairs of CTs and 3D photographs were analyzed.
The 95% confidence interval was 198.16 to 264.18 mm2 and the mean was 231.17 mm2.
Although statistically significant difference between the modalities was found, they can be attributable to the dampening effect of soft tissue.

CONCLUSION
However, a dampening effect can be attributable to the soft tissue.


OBJECTIVES
This study examined the effects of adjunctive trazodone on depression outcome in adolescents in a naturalistic treatment environment.

RESULTS
Exposure to trazodone was significantly associated with non-response to treatment in our sample (n= 35; β1= -7.76; 95% CI -0.52 to - 15.0; p<0.05; R2 = 0.13).

CONCLUSION
In keeping with previous research, we found that trazodone exposure was associated with treatment non-response in adolescents taking SRIs.
The findings should be interpreted cautiously since they are limited by small sample size.
Future randomized controlled trials of trazodone in samples of adolescents taking SRIs for depression are warranted.


Methods
This cross-sectional survey consisted of clinical scenarios for emergency prescribing, adapting or renewing a prescription, and initial-access prescribing for a chronic disease.

Results
Thirteen pharmacists representing Canadian provinces other than Alberta were surveyed in late 2015, for comparison with Alberta.
With specific reference to the scenarios presented, pharmacists were able to prescribe in an emergency in 9 of the 10 provinces, renew prescriptions in all provinces, and adapt prescriptions in 6 provinces.
Pharmacists were allowed to administer vaccines in 9 provinces, and 5 provinces allowed pharmacists to administer drugs by injection.
Three provinces had systems in place for pharmacists to access laboratory test results, and 2 allowed pharmacists to order laboratory tests.
Five provinces had government-reimbursed programs in place for select prescribing services; however, all 9 provinces with public vaccination programs reimbursed pharmacists for this service.

Conclusions
Pharmacist prescribing differs among Canadian provinces.


Background
However, this type of therapy can promote selection of resistant organisms and may necessitate venous access.
Fosfomycin is an orally administered, single-dose antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Methods
Urinary isolates were collected prospectively from November 2015 to April 2016 at 3 hospitals in southwestern Ontario.

Results
A total of 137 urinary isolates were tested: 106 positive for ESBL-or AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (95 Escherichia coli, 11 Klebsiella spp.) and 31 positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.


Methods
The search used subject headings and keywords with no language restrictions.
Quality was assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.
We performed the meta-analysis using a random effects model.
Subgroup analysis and meta-regression was done for heterogeneity and the Egger test was used to assess publication bias.

Findings
Thirty-eight studies involving 20 043 women were analysed.
Studies had a high degree of heterogeneity (I  = 96.8%) and there was evidence of publication bias (Egger bias = 2.58; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.83-4.33).
The overall pooled estimate of the prevalence of postpartum depression was 22% (95% CI: 19-25).
Small, but non-significant differences in pooled prevalence were found by mother's age, geographical location and study setting.
Reported risk factors for postpartum depression included financial difficulties, presence of domestic violence, past history of psychiatric illness in mother, marital conflict, lack of support from husband and birth of a female baby.

Conclusion
The review shows a high prevalence of postpartum depression in Indian mothers.


Methods
We recruited symptomatic travellers consulting our clinic and we confirmed infection with either reverse-transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or virus neutralization test.
Using RT-PCR, we monitored Zika virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads in semen until we obtained two negative results.

Findings
The longest duration of viral shedding in semen before obtaining the first negative RT-PCR result was 144 days after symptom onset.
All of the 11 participants, for whom we microscopically analysed their semen, had presence of leukocytes, 10 showed haematospermia and six showed oligospermia.
These abnormalities occurred irrespective of Zika virus detection in semen.

Conclusion
The majority of men in our study had detectable Zika virus RNA in their semen.


Methods
Absolute decrease in TFA consumption (g/day) was the main outcome measure.
We excluded studies reporting only on the TFA content in food products without a link to intake.
We included trials, observational studies, meta-analyses and modelling studies.
We conducted a narrative synthesis to interpret the data, grouping studies on a continuum ranging from interventions targeting individuals to population-wide, structural changes.

Results
Worksite interventions achieved reductions averaging 1.2 g/day.

Conclusion
Multicomponent interventions including legislation to eliminate TFAs from food products were the most effective strategy.


Methods
The continent-wide prevalence of exposure was estimated using random-effects meta-analysis.

Findings
Of the 904 articles identified, 65 studies from 21 African countries were included.
Exposure was largely due to percutaneous injury, which had an estimated 12-month prevalence of 36.0% (95% CI: 31.2-40.8).
The pooled 12-month prevalence of occupational exposure among medical doctors (excluding surgeons), nurses (including midwives and nursing assistants) and laboratory staff (including laboratory technicians) was 46.6% (95% CI: 33.5-59.7), 44.6% (95% CI: 34.1-55.0) and 34.3% (95% CI: 21.8-46.7), respectively.
The risk of exposure was higher among health-care workers with no training on infection prevention and those who worked more than 40 hours per week.

Conclusion
However, a lack of data from some countries was a major limitation.


Methods
In this pilot study, specific areas of 2 biological safety cabinets (class II, type B2) were deliberately contaminated with a defined quantity of cyclophosphamide (10 μg or 107 pg).
Three cleaning solutions were tested: quaternary ammonium, sodium hypochlorite 0.02%, and sodium hypochlorite 2%.
After cleaning, the cyclophosphamide remaining on the areas was quantified by wipe sampling.
Each cleaning solution was tested 3 times, with cleaning and wipe sampling being performed 5 times for each test.

Results
A total of 57 wipe samples were collected and analyzed.
The average recovery efficiency was 121.690% (standard deviation 5.058%).

Conclusions
All of the cleaning solutions reduced contamination of biological safety cabinet workbenches exposed to a defined amount of cyclophosphamide.
Quaternary ammonium and sodium hypochlorite (0.02% and 2%) had mean efficacy greater than 97% for removal of the initial quantity of the drug (107 pg) after the first cleaning session.
When sodium hypochlorite 2% was used, fewer cleaning sessions were required to complete decontamination.


Background
Infectious diseases consultant (IDC) pharmacists work within an IDC service to care for inpatients with complex infections.

Methods
A survey of IDC and AMS pharmacists at Canadian tertiary care academic hospitals was conducted between February and April 2015.

Results
The survey response rate was 77% (68/88).
The 68 respondents self-identified as IDC pharmacists (14 [21%]), AMS pharmacists (34 [50%]), or dual-role IDC and AMS pharmacists (20 [29%]).
The 3 groups of pharmacists described similar educational responsibilities.
The AMS pharmacists performed more of the following administrative and research duties: development of antibiograms and preprinted orders, collection of antimicrobial metrics, and drug-use evaluations for antimicrobials.


Background
Documentation of information in the health record by pharmacists is vital to patient care.

Methods
This study used prospective audit methodology.
Four of the elements of chart note documentation were assessed on a yes/no basis, and Bloom's taxonomy was used to define the level of competency for the other 14 elements.
Values were assigned to each level and were then used to calculate mean scores.

Results
A total of 115 pharmacist notes, created by 29 of the 35 pharmacists included in the study, were assessed.
The mean competency score per pharmacist was 2.2 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3; maximum score 3).
The level of competency was not significantly affected by additional clinical training or years of hospital experience.


Background
Many patients experience adverse events at the time of discharge from hospital, and most of these events are medication-related.
To improve patient safety, Health PEI (the health authority for Prince Edward Island) has made medication reconciliation a priority.
The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown is one of the few Canadian hospitals with an electronic discharge process.

Methods
The study was conducted on 4 nursing units offering medical and surgical services.

Results
During the study period, data were compiled for the 72 of 154 eligible patients who provided consent.
Of these, 69 (96%) had a change in medications.
Fifty-four patients were discharged home, of whom 50 presented to the community pharmacy after discharge, 37 (74%) of these on the day of discharge.


Objective
Anxiety-based school refusal in adolescence is a complex, sometimes difficult to treat disorder that can have serious academic and psychiatric consequences.
The objective of this qualitative study was to explore how teens with this problem and their parents experience the psychiatric care received.

Methods
Data collection by purposive sampling continued until we reached theoretical sufficiency.
Data analysis was thematic.

Results
This study included 20 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years and 21 parents.

Conclusion
Our results show a divergence between parents and teens in their representations of care and especially of its goals.


METHODS
Hospital-associated costs were calculated only for the surgical group.

RESULTS
Of 784 injured children, 258 (33%) required surgery, 40% of whom underwent orthopedic interventions.
These patients were older and more severely injured, and they had longer lengths of stay than their nonsurgical counterparts.
There was no difference in mortality between the groups.
Seventy-four surgical patients required intervention within 4 hours of admission; 45% of them required neurosurgical intervention.
The median cost of hospitalization was $27 571 for the surgical group.

CONCLUSION
Despite the associated costs, the surgical treatment of children was associated with comparable mortality to nonsurgical treatment of less severely injured patients.


Methods
We obtained data from four national consumer expenditure surveys and three health-care utilization surveys conducted between 1993 and 2014.
Households were divided into five groups by age composition.
We defined catastrophic health expenditure as out-of-pocket payments equalling or exceeding 10% of household expenditure.
Factors associated with catastrophic expenditure were identified by multivariable analysis.

Findings
The proportion increased more in the poorest than the richest quintile: 3.00-fold versus 1.74-fold, respectively, across the utilization surveys.

Conclusion
The proportion of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure in India increased over the past two decades.


Methods
We included identified studies and reports summarizing national experience in implementing any of the IHR (2005) core capacities or their components.
We excluded studies that were theoretical or referred to IHR (1969).
Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative synthesis.

Findings
We analysed 51 articles from 77 countries representing all WHO Regions.

Conclusion
These lessons learnt could be adapted by countries in the process of meeting IHR (2005) requirements.


Background
Interaction between alcohol and certain medications can lead to adverse consequences.

Methods
Attendees of an adult mental health day hospital program were invited to participate.

Results
A total of 131 participants answered the questionnaire between July 2014 and February 2015; 31 of the questionnaires were incomplete and were excluded from analysis.
Serious adverse effects, such as worsening of a psychiatric condition, admission to hospital, and increased drowsiness, were reported by 23 participants.
Sixty-nine participants considered physicians to be the best source of information about these interactions.

Conclusions
Nevertheless, consumption of alcohol occurred, and almost one-quarter of participants reported a serious adverse effect related to consuming alcohol.
These self-reported data indicate that patients do not necessarily follow the advice of their health care providers.
Future studies should explore reasons for the gap between advice and action and how to minimize it.


Background
However, few studies have examined clinical outcomes in the general population.

Methods
The primary outcome (clinical success), the secondary outcomes (30-day in-hospital mortality, time to defervescence, duration of therapy, and length of stay), and drug costs were compared between cohorts.

Results
The 2 cohorts did not differ significantly in terms of baseline characteristics.
Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference in any of the secondary outcomes.


Methods
A total of 150 normal and 250 PE + DM subjects were enrolled in this study.
Ward's minimum variance cluster analysis and principal component analysis were used for evaluation of dependence between genetic, clinical, and demographic parameters.

Results
These repeats have positive correlation with PEDT (r = 0.28, p = 0.0001: r = 0.24, p = 0.0001, whole model) and inversely correlated with BDI-II (r = - 0.25, p = 0.0001).

Conclusion
This study indicates that androgen receptor polymorphism modulates the endocrine effect on ejaculatory reflex and depends strongly on its "cofactors".
However, endocrine regulation of PE reflex is a complex phenomenon that requires further investigation.


METHODS
Hospital-associated costs were calculated only for the surgical group.

RESULTS
Of 784 injured children, 258 (33%) required surgery, 40% of whom underwent orthopedic interventions.
These patients were older and more severely injured, and they had longer lengths of stay than their nonsurgical counterparts.
There was no difference in mortality between the groups.
Seventy-four surgical patients required intervention within 4 hours of admission; 45% of them required neurosurgical intervention.
The median cost of hospitalization was $27 571 for the surgical group.

CONCLUSION
Despite the associated costs, the surgical treatment of children was associated with comparable mortality to nonsurgical treatment of less severely injured patients.


METHODS
We collected demographic and clinical data including mechanism of injury, location and severity of the injury, concurrent injuries, physiologic parameters and clinical outcome.

RESULTS
We identified 110 patients with IAVIs, of whom 98 had sustained penetrating injuries (55 gunshot wounds and 43 stab wounds).
There were 84 arterial injuries (including 21 renal and 17 mesenteric) and 74 venous injuries (including 21 renal and 17 inferior vena caval).
Combined venous and arterial injuries were found in almost one-third of patients (34 [30.9%]).
Fifty-seven patients (51.8%) required intensive care admission.
The overall mortality rate was 28.2% (31 patients); the rate was 62% for aortic injuries and 47% for inferior vena cava injuries.
Liver injury, large bowel injury, splenic injury and elevated lactate level were all associated with a statistically significantly higher mortality rate.

CONCLUSION
Integration of endovascular techniques may provide an alternative strategy to improve outcomes.


Background
Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as the loss of at least three pregnancies in the first trimester.
Although the most common cause is embryo aneuploidy, and despite female checkup and couple karyotyping, in about 50% of cases RPL remain unexplained.
Male implication has little been investigated and results are discordant.

Methods
A total of 33 cases and 27 controls were included from three university hospitals.
The Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon or Fisher exact tests were used.
A non-parametric Spearman correlation was performed in order to analyze the relationship between various sperm parameters and FISH and sperm DNA fragmentation results.

Results
We found significant differences between cases and controls in time to conceive, body mass index (BMI), family history of infertility and living environment.
In cases, total sperm motility and the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa were significantly decreased.
No difference was found between cases and controls in sperm DNA fragmentation or chromatin integrity.
In cases, spermatozoa with aneuploidy, hyperhaploidy and chromosome 18 disomy were significantly increased.

Conclusions
The originality of our study lies in the comprehensive andrological examination and search for risk factors and fertility history.
Further studies are needed to confirm the links between unexplained RPL and a male family history of infertility or miscarriages.
The increased sperm aneuploidy observed in unexplained RPL supports a male etiology.
These data pave the way for further studies to demonstrate the value of preimplantation genetic screening in men with increased sperm aneuploidy whose partners experience unexplained RPL.


Objective
To perform a needs assessment of journal club in plastic surgery residency programs.

Results
Three-quarters of residents indicated that there was no tool provided to aid them in their analysis of the literature.
Finally, most residents also responded that they were not assessed objectively with regard to their performance.

Conclusions
Future study should focus on the best way to meet these objectives.


Methods
This study was conducted in 2013-2014.
The NCD risk factors examined were: current daily smoking, eating fewer than 5 servings of fruits/vegetable a day, low physical activity, overweight and obesity.
A total of 7 710 households were selected and 1 adult was enrolled from each household.

Results
The prevalence of tobacco use was 19.7%.
The majority of the respondents (96.5%) consumed fewer than 5 servings of fruits/vegetables a day, 41.5% had a low level of physical activity, 26.3% were overweight and 14.9% were obese.
The prevalence of stage I and stage II hypertension, including those on medication, was 37% and 15.9% respectively.
The prevalence of NCD risk factors differed significantly by sex and occupation (P = 0.0001) but not by age group (P = 0.118), level of education (P = 0.668) and province (P = 0.056).
Only 0.6% of the sample had none of the 5 NCD risk factors while 40% had 3-5.

Conclusion
The high prevalence of NCD risk factors in Punjab and Sindh provinces is of concern.


Objective
Exploratory hypotheses were formulated for regional variability in adolescent suicide rates over time in Canada.

Results
Ontario and British Columbia have had non-significant fluctuations since 2001.
The trends remained similar overall when excluding undetermined deaths from the analyses.

Conclusions
Variations in adolescent suicide trends across provinces were found.


Methods
We included controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time-series studies published up to December 2017.

Findings
We found a medium (11 studies) or high risk (13 studies) of bias.
However, the studied interventions and reported outcomes varied widely.
The most frequent intervention was procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment (8 of 27 studies, all randomized controlled trials).
The intervention was associated with a relative risk for patients receiving antibiotics ranging between 0.40 and 0.87.

Conclusion
The majority of studies reported a positive effect of hospital antibiotic stewardship interventions.
To strengthen the evidence base, action needs to be taken to address these shortcomings.


Background
A compelling body of evidence supports the notion that transfer of accountability (TOA) improves communication, continuity of care, and patient safety.
TOA involves the transmission and receipt of information between clinicians at each transition of care.
Without a notification system alerting pharmacists to patient transfers, pharmacists' ability to seek out and complete TOA may be hindered.
A standardized policy and process for TOA, with automated workflow, was implemented at the study hospital in 2015, to ensure consistency and timeliness of documentation by pharmacists.

Methods
A retrospective audit was conducted, using a random sample of individuals who were inpatients between June 2014 and February 2016.
Transition points for TOA were identified, and the computerized pharmacy system was reviewed to determine whether TOA had been documented at each transition point.

Results
Before the TOA workflow was implemented, TOA documentation by pharmacists ranged from 11% (10/93) to 43% (48/111) of transitions.
Eight months after implementation of the workflow, the rate of TOA documentation was 87% (68/78), exceeding the institution's target of 70%.
Of the 32 pharmacists surveyed, most were satisfied with the TOA policy and agreed that the standardized workflow was simple to use, increased the number of TOAs provided and received, and improved the quality of completed TOAs.
Respondents also indicated that the TOA workflow had improved patient care (mean score 4.09/5, standard deviation 0.64).


Background
Pharmacists in the intensive care unit (ICU) provide pharmaceutical care to critically ill patients.
Identification and resolution of drug therapy problems improves outcomes for these patients.

Results
Thirteen of the pharmacists completed the survey.
All 13 pharmacists (100%) were satisfied with usability; 12 (92%) were satisfied with training, organization, and accuracy of the process; and 11 (85%) were satisfied with completeness and efficiency.
Most pharmacists conducted 1 or 2 handovers per week, with each having a duration of 3-5 min.

Conclusions
Respondents were highly satisfied with the handover tool and process.


Background
Identification of risk factors for ESBL infection may facilitate the selection of appropriate empiric therapy.

Objectives
The secondary objective was to characterize the outcomes of patients with ESBL urosepsis.

Methods
A single-centre retrospective nested case-control study was conducted from January 2011 to June 2013.
Multivariate analysis was then used to determine risk factors for ESBL urosepsis.

Results
The cumulative incidence of ESBL urosepsis at the study site was 19.4% (58/299) over 2.5 years.
The 58 cases of ESBL urosepsis were compared with 118 controls (patients with urosepsis caused by non-ESBL Enterobacteriaceae).

Conclusions
However, findings from this single-centre study may not be generalizable to other institutions.


Background
Medication reconciliation at transitions of care increases patient safety.
Collection of an accurate best possible medication history (BPMH) on admission is a key step.
National quality indicators are used as surrogate markers for BPMH quality, but no literature on their accuracy exists.
Obtaining a high-quality BPMH is often labour- and resource-intensive.

Methods
A panel of experts reviewed the errors and ranked their severity.

Results
BPMHs were prepared for a total of 40 patients.
Those prepared by nurses were more likely to contain an error than those prepared by pharmacy students (171 versus 43 errors, p = 0.006).
There was a nonsignificant trend toward less severe errors in BPMHs completed by pharmacy students.

Conclusions
The surrogate marker (number of BPMH sources) may not reflect BPMH quality.


Background
Medication use during pregnancy is common.

Methods
A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted over a period of 6 months in 2010.
Questionnaires were distributed to 400 of 800 licensed pharmacists employed in Qatar (in government and private sectors).

Results
Of the 400 questionnaires distributed, 207 were returned (52% response rate).
Most pharmacists (71%) had not participated in any educational activities on medication use in pregnancy.
About 50% reported that < 10% of their workload involved dispensing medications to pregnant women.
A lack of available resources and unknown pregnancy status were the main concerns about dispensing medication to pregnant women.
The majority of the respondents had average knowledge about medication use in pregnancy.
There was a significant association between knowledge, and continuing education and years of experience (P < 0.05).


Background
To provide effective mental health services, the World Health Organization emphasizes the integration of mental health into primary health care (PHC).

Methods
Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide.
Data were collected until theoretical saturation was achieved and conventional content analysis was carried out.

Results
First was the perceived lack of support within the system in terms of resource allocation and acceptance from the community.
Second was the lack of human resources in the field of mental health.
In addition, resistance at the PHC level is likely as staff are already burdened with other preventive care services.


Background
Data from Turkey show that sense organ diseases were the second leading cause of years lost due to disability in 2015.
However, there are no reliable data on either the baseline causative disorders of visual impairment or the burden of these disorders on the population in Izmir region.
Izmir is the third most populated city of Turkey with a population of approximately 4.2 million.

Methods
We evaluated the ophthalmologic reports of 20 790 people in Izmir, Turkey.
Age- and sex-specific causes of low vision and blindness were identified.

Results
Bilateral low vision and blindness was detected in 347 people, 172 males and 175 females.
For those aged 18-50 years, retinal dystrophies (37%), congenital eye anomalies (14%) and myopic degenerations (13%) were the most common causes.
For those aged 50+ years, age-related macular degeneration (21%) was the leading cause.
Diabetic retinopathy (17%), corneal opacities (14%), cataract (12%) and glaucoma (9%) were also important.
Sex was not a significant determinant.


Methods
The applied methods were situation analysis and a mixed qualitative-quantitative method.

Results
The outcomes of the Iranian food and nutrition security system in the past three decades include development of management infrastructure and improvement in food and nutrition security status.
However, analysis of current programmes showed that there were some overlapping, intertwining and parallel works in the responsibilities of related organizations in the field of supervision of food safety (from production to supply).
The national document produced as the outcome of this paper was communicated by the Iranian Ministry of Health in 2012 and has been running for 2 years.
Selected ministries are responsible for implementation of 20 national programmes by the end of the 5th Economic, Social and Cultural Development Programme (2016-2011).

Conclusion
The most important challenge in establishing national documents is to make them operational.


Background
Tooth brushing twice a day using a fluoridated toothpaste is a crucial preventive measure.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the yearly use of 6 tubes of toothpaste of 170g each and 4 toothbrushes per individual.

Results
Guidelines governing the quality of toothpastes are regulated by LIBNOR and follow European Standards.

Conclusion
The yearly consumption of both toothpaste tubes and toothbrushes was below WHO recommendations.


METHODS
Surgeons and medical oncologists involved in the management of colorectal cancer at 2 academic institutions and affiliated community hospitals were surveyed.
Case scenarios were selected to illustrate critical aspects of assessment of resectability, best therapeutic approaches and specialty referral.
Standard statistical analyses were performed.

RESULTS
Of the 75 surgeons contacted, 64 responded (response rate 85%; 372 resectability assessments completed).
Hepatic metastases were more often considered resectable by hepatobiliary surgeons than all other respondents (92% v. 57%, p < 0.001).
Upfront systemic therapy was most commonly prioritized by surgical oncologists (p = 0.01).

CONCLUSION
Assessment of resectability varied significantly between specialties, and resectability was often underestimated by nonhepatobiliary surgeons.
Hepatobiliary referral was not considered in a substantial proportion of cases erroneously deemed unresectable.


METHODS
For 2-group comparisons, we used a 2-group test of proportions.

RESULTS
The response rate was 34.3% (361/1051); 205/698 staff surgeons (29.4%) and 156/353 surgical trainees (44.2%) responded.

CONCLUSION
Rates of double gloving leave room for improvement.
Surgical trainees were more likely than staff surgeons to double glove.


METHODS
We systematically searched Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL and the grey literature for studies comparing NAAP and AAP.
We reported treatment effects using random-effects models.

RESULTS
Of 602 articles identified, 5 met the inclusion criteria.
Most studies included only patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of I or II.
However, NAAP neither compromised patient willingness to repeat the procedure (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.83; 2367 patients) nor lengthened total procedure time (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -3.51 to 3.34; 2367 patients).

CONCLUSION
The results of this meta-analysis are limited by a lack of available high-quality studies.
Further, large-scale studies are needed for definitive conclusions.


METHODS
We collected demographic and clinical data including mechanism of injury, location and severity of the injury, concurrent injuries, physiologic parameters and clinical outcome.

RESULTS
We identified 110 patients with IAVIs, of whom 98 had sustained penetrating injuries (55 gunshot wounds and 43 stab wounds).
There were 84 arterial injuries (including 21 renal and 17 mesenteric) and 74 venous injuries (including 21 renal and 17 inferior vena caval).
Combined venous and arterial injuries were found in almost one-third of patients (34 [30.9%]).
Fifty-seven patients (51.8%) required intensive care admission.
The overall mortality rate was 28.2% (31 patients); the rate was 62% for aortic injuries and 47% for inferior vena cava injuries.
Liver injury, large bowel injury, splenic injury and elevated lactate level were all associated with a statistically significantly higher mortality rate.

CONCLUSION
Integration of endovascular techniques may provide an alternative strategy to improve outcomes.


Methods
We developed a method to assist decision-makers with constrained resources and insufficient knowledge about a society's preferences to choose between policies with unequal, and at times opposing, effects on multiple outcomes.
We tested the method against three previously published analyses of health policies in low-income settings.

Results
When applied to previous analyses, our new method performed better than traditional cost-effectiveness analysis and standard data envelopment analysis.

Conclusion
Health-system-adapted data envelopment analysis allows any quantifiable attribute or determinant of health to be included in a calculation.


Methods
Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to explore Syrian refugee health needs and services in camp and urban settings in Jordan.

Results
Focus group discussions and key informant interviews revealed a many different problems.
Cost, limited resources, changing policies, livelihoods and poor health literacy impeded delivery of public and clinical health services.
Respondent Type 1 emphasized the importance of policy changes to improve Syrian refugee health.
Type 2 highlighted access to fresh foods and recreational activities for children.
For Type 3, poor quality drinking-water was the primary concern, and Type 4 believed the lack of good, free education for Syrian children exacerbated their mental health problems.

Conclusions
Syrian refugees identified cost as the main barrier to health care access.


Methods
This was a cross-sectional study in 32 governmental primary schools during November 2014-February 2015.

Results
Of 800 questionnaires distributed, 706 (88.3%) were completed; 58.4% were from women.
The prevalence of burnout was 24.5% (95% CI: 21.5-27.8).
A statistically significant association was found between burnout and age, sex and marital status.

Conclusion
Burnout is an important health problem among primary school teachers in Basrah.


Title
Seroprevalence and social determinants of varicella in Turkey.

Background
However, there is limited information on the morbidity (incidence and seroprevalence), mortality and burden of disease of varicella in the overall Turkish population.

Results
The overall seroprevalence was 92.8% and the seroprevalence was > 90% among all age groups except 2-9 years (55.7%).

Conclusion
High seroprevalance depends on natural exposure to the infectious agent itself and is not associated with social determinants.


Background
Growth faltering in early life can adversely affect health in later childhood and adulthood.

Methods
This retrospective cohort study was conducted in 2014 in 10 randomly selected primary health care clinics in 5 governorates of Gaza.

Results
A total of 2 632 children's cards were included at the beginning of the study.
Weight-for-age and weight-forlength decreased from birth to 6 months to about -0.40 SD but increased afterwards to -0.11 SD and 0.34 SD at 24 months respectively.
Length-for-age declined after 6 months, reaching -0.85 SD at 24 months.
At 6 months, the prevalence of underweight and stunting were 5% and 9% but at 24 months, the prevalence was 4% and 20% respectively.
Wasting was highest at 6 months (10%) but decreased to 3% at 24 months.
Significantly more girls were stunted at 9, 12 and 18 months (P < 0.001), underweight at 24 months (P < 0.05) and wasted at 12 months (P < 0.05).
Early life faltering in length was more pronounced than weight, with stunting occurring in one fifth of boys and girls by 2 years of age.


METHODS
The diagnosis of therapeutic failure was defined according to the WHO criteria.

RESULTS
the population of study was 311 infected patients, 53.8 % were male.
Prevalence of the failure was at 19.6 %.

CONCLUSION
prevalence of therapeutic failure was high for the children being followed at the Sanou-Sourô University Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso.


Background
Anemia is a common health issue for elderly patients.

Results
A total of 144 patients were included in the study, of whom 76 had iron-deficiency anemia.
No serious, life-threatening adverse reactions were reported.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting.
The mean increase in hemoglobin count was 13.5 g/L, a statistically significant change from baseline.

Conclusions
Use of FGC led to increased hemoglobin count within 60 days.


Study Selection
and Data Extraction

Data Synthesis
The search identified 8 studies evaluating the potential interaction between SSRIs and the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline.
The largest, a retrospective cohort study of 1504 patients with Parkinson disease, found no cases of serotonin syndrome with coadministration of rasagiline and an SSRI.
A survey of 63 investigators in the Parkinson Study Group identified 11 potential cases of serotonin syndrome among 4568 patients treated with the combination of selegiline and antidepressants (including SSRIs).

Conclusions
Among the SSRIs, citalopram and sertraline may be preferred.


Objectives
The effect of other factors on pulmonary function, including obesity, breastfeeding and parental atopy, was also examined.

Methods
Children aged 7-12 years from rural Shibin El-Kom and urban Cairo were enrolled in the study.
Factorial repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the differences in the rate of change in FEV1 predicted%, FVC predicted% and PEFR between the children in Cairo and Shibin El-Kom.
Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyse factors associated with pulmonary function test results.

Conclusions
The findings could be used to help in the development of policies in Egypt and other developing countries to improve respiratory health, including promoting breastfeeding and reducing outdoor air pollution.


Background
Unsafe injection practices put patients and providers at risk of infectious and noninfectious adverse events.

Methods
We conducted a national cross-sectional survey in 2007 using the World Health Organization tool to evaluate injection safety practices.

Results
There was no shortage of injection equipment nor evidence of attempts to sterilize disposable devices.
Care providers immediately disposed of the used needle/syringe in sharps containers.
Phlebotomy devices were taken from sealed packets in 96% of facilities.
In private facilities, 66.3% of the care providers were fully immunized against hepatitis B. Wearing a new pair of gloves for phlebotomy was observed in only 46% of government and 38% of private health facilities.
Many health facilities lacked alcohol-based handrub.

Conclusions
Many injection safety aspects were satisfactory.


Methods
This cross-sectional study included 1 202 high-school students in Khorramabad in the 2015-2016 academic year.
Students were selected using stratified and multistage cluster random sampling.
Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics of the students, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used to assess symptoms of mental disorders.
Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the presence of symptoms of mental disorder and sociodemographic characteristics.

Results
The mean age of the students was 16.1 (SD 0.9) years and 52.7% were girls.
Overall, 481 (40%) students (34% of males, 46% of females) had symptoms of mental disorders.
Most had mild symptoms; 5% had severe symptoms.
Female students, those in higher school grades, and those whose fathers were unemployed and mothers were housewives were significantly more likely to have symptoms of mental disorders (P < 0.05).

Conclusions
This study found a high prevalence of symptoms associated with mental disorders in the adolescents in Khorramabad.


Introduction
We wished to update the data.

Methods
PubMed was used to identify original articles published between 1998 and May 2017 describing the association between TML and testicular tumor.
Studies were only included if TML was diagnosed by US.
A Z-Test was used to identify differences within these subgroups.
In addition, we identified prospective cohorts of TML patients.
Numbers, duration of follow-up, and occurrence of the "testicular tumor" event were recorded for each of them.

Results
One hundred and seventy-five articles were identified, 40 of which were included.
Our review has not showed a clear evidence that cryptorchidism associated with TML is a risk factor for testicular tumor.
However, there seems to be a correlation between infertility associated with TML and a higher tumor risk.
There were not enough studies to confirm a relationship between family or personal history associated with TML and the tumor risk.
However, these groups are assumed to contain bias and caution must be taken regarding conclusions.

Conclusion
In the absence of risk factors, the occurrence of testicular cancer in patients with TML is similar to the risk of the general population.


Objective
This paper describes a feasibility project to develop one overall detailed strategy with specific adaptations for each of the three crises for adolescents in intensive services.
It is a contribution to the discussion and joint service/parent management of these crises.

Results
Since the purpose was to develop and evolve the strategy, it did not lend itself to a clear research outcome.
Parents regained skills, hope and improved relationships with their adolescents.
They developed the confidence, specific knowledge and skills to manage for the future.

Conclusions
The successful development and evolution of the strategy demonstrated feasibility of the concept.


Methods
A household cluster survey was conducted in Mansheiet Nasser, a large slum area in Cairo.
The study included 984 adult participants.

Results
Smoking, insufficient fruit/vegetable consumption, low physical activity and diabetes were reported by 43.4%, 92.2%, 98.4% and 8.7% of the sample respectively.
The prevalence of hypertension and overweight/obesity were 31.2% and 73.0% respectively.
Most of the participants (83.8%) had ≥ 3 cardiovascular risk factors.
A significantly higher proportion of men smoked, engaged in less physical activity, had diabetes and had multiple risk factors.

Conclusions
Measures are needed to improve their lifestyles and reduce their risk of cardiovascular diseases.


Background
Hospital waste management (HWM) rules in Pakistan were issued in 2005.

Methods
Pretested structured questionnaires based on WHO recommendations were used to survey all teaching hospitals of Peshawar District from January to March 2015.
Besides descriptive statistics, public and private hospitals were compared using Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Results
None of the hospitals followed waste segregation and colour coding.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
It was a cross-sectional study conducted in 2007 in the Fousseyni DAOU Hospital of Kayes.
The variables studied were knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding HIV/AIDS, the notion of traveling outside of Mali and emigration.
Pearson Chi2 and Fisher test were used for a bivariate analysis.

RESULTS
The female/male sex ratio was of 2.51.
In this data pool, 32.3% (10/31) of men were emigrants.
More than a third 37.2% (29/78) of women had an emigrant as a sexual partner.
There was no significant difference in the levels of knowledge regarding HIV between emigrants and those who never went abroad.
An emigrant was five times more likely to have at least two sexual partners [OR=5.11, CI 95% (1.37-18.94)].

CONCLUSION
Sensitization of the candidates to emigration must be reinforced.


INTRODUCTION
The cervical disc hernia is uncommon.
Its diagnosis is usually easy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The diagnosis was made on clinical and cervical myéloscanner.
The postoperative decline was between 1 and 5 years.

RESULTS
The average age of patients was 43 years ranging from 20-68 years.
A male prevalence (2/1) was noted.
The majority of hernias was degenerative.
It was mostly soft disc hernia that prevailed on floors C4-C5 and C5-C6.
We always operated on the right side of the patient.
We performed a discectomy of a floor in 8 cases and 2 floors in 1 case.
The vertebral posterior longitudinal ligament was opened routinely.
Graft with osteosynthesis was used in 4 cases.
The outcome was good.
A spontaneous fusion was noted in 7 cases.

CONCLUSION
It is usually associated with good postoperative results.


INTRODUCTION
Albuminuria, an important marker of kidney damage, is still insufficiently studied in sub-Saharan Africa.

METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional study in the town of Kaya.
Selected children or their parents were interviewed.
Anthropometric measurements and urinary samples were performed.

RESULTS
Two hundred six children (113 girls and 93 boys) participated in the study.
Albuminuria was found in 18 children whether 8.7% of cases.
Sociodemographic factors were not associated with the occurrence of albuminuria in children.


INTRODUCTION
Pain is a frequent reason of consultation in traumatological emergencies.
Its management is characterized by oligoanalgesia whose causes are multiple.
The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge and practices of pain management by traumatological emergencies staff of the teaching hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo of Ouagadougou.

RESULTS
A total of 67 health workers participated in the study with a participation rate of 98% and 100%, respectively, for the medical and paramedical staff.
According to their report, 65.3% of medical and 77.7% of paramedical staff had never received training on pain and its management.
For 85.7% of physicians, pain should be assessed before treatment, but 79.6% of them didnot know any conventional pain assessment method.
All the nurses and 40.8% of physicians felt that pain in the emergency services should not be treated immediately to prevent misdiagnosis.
Morphine and regional anesthesia were not used for pain treatment in the emergency room.
10.2% of medical staff and 27.8% of the paramedics said that they systematically search for the analgesicsside effects.

CONCLUSION
The knowledge of health workers about pain and its management is insufficient.


AIMS
This study describes the epidemiological and clinical features of colorectal cancer at a University hospital in Bamako, Mali.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
It included records of patients with colorectal cancer histologically documented in the service.
Were analyzed epidemiological, clinical and biological data stored in files.

RESULTS
One hundred-thirteen (113) cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed representing 15% of all cancers documented over the 7 years.
The time between first the symptom and care is long and the diagnosis is made in 85% of cases at a metastatic stage.
Localization of the cancer is more frequent in the colon (56%) than in the rectum (44%).
Cancer is an adenocarcinoma in 97% of cases.


METHODS
We conducted a qualitative study from May to October 2016 using semistructured telephone interviews (mean duration 29 min) with general surgeons in Ontario.
We analyzed the data using established techniques of thematic analysis.

RESULTS
We interviewed 22 general surgeons.
Preservation of reputation and quality care, commitment and succession planning, and retirement planning were dominant themes.
Logistical barriers and financial insecurity led to retirement delay.

CONCLUSION
Surgeons begin to plan for retirement both early and late in their careers.
Opportunities to support surgeons at all career stages in their retirement planning require further exploration.


METHODS
We systematically searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL and the grey literature for studies comparing NAAP and AAP.
We reported treatment effects using random-effects models.

RESULTS
Of 602 articles identified, 5 met the inclusion criteria.
Most studies included only patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of I or II.
However, NAAP neither compromised patient willingness to repeat the procedure (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.83; 2367 patients) nor lengthened total procedure time (mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -3.51 to 3.34; 2367 patients).

CONCLUSION
The results of this meta-analysis are limited by a lack of available high-quality studies.
Further, large-scale studies are needed for definitive conclusions.


METHODS
For 2-group comparisons, we used a 2-group test of proportions.

RESULTS
The response rate was 34.3% (361/1051); 205/698 staff surgeons (29.4%) and 156/353 surgical trainees (44.2%) responded.

CONCLUSION
Rates of double gloving leave room for improvement.
Surgical trainees were more likely than staff surgeons to double glove.


METHODS
Surgeons and medical oncologists involved in the management of colorectal cancer at 2 academic institutions and affiliated community hospitals were surveyed.
Case scenarios were selected to illustrate critical aspects of assessment of resectability, best therapeutic approaches and specialty referral.
Standard statistical analyses were performed.

RESULTS
Of the 75 surgeons contacted, 64 responded (response rate 85%; 372 resectability assessments completed).
Hepatic metastases were more often considered resectable by hepatobiliary surgeons than all other respondents (92% v. 57%, p < 0.001).
Upfront systemic therapy was most commonly prioritized by surgical oncologists (p = 0.01).

CONCLUSION
Assessment of resectability varied significantly between specialties, and resectability was often underestimated by nonhepatobiliary surgeons.
Hepatobiliary referral was not considered in a substantial proportion of cases erroneously deemed unresectable.


INTRODUCTION
Hemangiomas are regenerative benign vascular tumors of the child, which may be of interest to all organs, most often located on the skin.
The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of haemangiomas on black skin.
It is a descriptive cross-sectional study that took place from November 2015 to August 2016 at CNAM, in the department of dermatology-leprology- Venereology of Mali.

RESULTS
Of 14,810 patients seen in consultation, we received 17 cases of hemangioma, ie 0,11%.
The average age was 5 months with extremes of 1 month and 60 months.
Tuberous angiomas represent 82,35% of clinical forms, subcutaneous angiomas 11,76% and mixed angiomas 5,89%.
In 4/17 of our patients there was an infectious complication, following an ulceration on the first day of the consultation.
The average lesion size was 3,25cm with extreme 0.5cm and 8cm.
The number of lesions per patient was 1 in 16 patients and 2 in 1 patient.
In 10/17 patients the lesions were localized at the cephalic level, 3/17 at the trunk level, and 4/17 at the perineum.

CONCLUSION
Infantile hemangioma is a poorly reported condition on black skin.
The demands for care are motivated either by the character showing lesions or by ulcerative complications.
Sensitization of populations and ongoing training of health workers are needed to detect hemangiomas.


Background
Gingivitis is a risk factor for periodontitis, which is associated with several systemic disorders.

Methods
A sample of Saudi Arabian males (n = 685) aged 13-15 years from Dammam and Khobar were included in a cross-sectional study in 2016.
Clinical examinations recorded plaque and gingival indices on 6 index teeth.
Regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of gingivitis severity with tooth-brushing and smoking adjusted for sugary drinks and foods, socioeconomic factors and dental plaque.

Results
The response rate was 96.2%.
Only 38% of the respondents brushed their teeth twice daily, 10.2% smoked, and 82.8% and 68.3% consumed sugary drinks and sugary foods respectively.
The prevalence of plaque and gingivitis was 87.9% and 73.9% respectively.
Tooth-brushing was not significantly associated with more severe gingivitis (regression coefficient = 0.17; 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.49).


Title
Prevalence of and risk factors for overweight and obesity among adolescents in Morocco.

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2014 and March 2015 in public secondary schools.
Data were collected from a questionnaire.
Weight and height were measured, and body mass index was calculated.
Weight was classified according to the reference curves of WHO (2007).
Data on 1818 adolescents aged 12-18 years were used.

Results
The prevalence of overweight was 7.69% and that of obesity was 3.41%.


Methods
Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the caregivers/parents of the children using a client satisfaction questionnaire.

Results
Based on what was reported by health care providers, most did not adhere to the recommended practices in the care of children with cerebral palsy.
Review of the medical records also showed a lack of compliance with standards.
The mean total satisfaction percentage score of parents/caregivers was 55.43% (SD 18.16).

Conclusions
Moreover, the documentation system in the hospital is poor.
A quality improvement plan is needed for the provision of care to children with cerebral palsy.


Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted on 800 of 8 000 high-school students in Sabzevar.
Stratified sampling was used.
Demographic data and academic information were collected and the parents of the students completed a food frequency questionnaire which included 189 food items.
The students' weight and height were measured using standard methods.

Results
The mean body mass index of female and male students was 20.

Conclusions
Nutrition education and nutritional support strategies are recommended to improve the nutritional status of these students.


Methods
We obtained all data from China's National Maternal Near Miss Surveillance System for 2012 to 2016.

Findings
For the period, 6 970 032 births, including 66 494 stillbirths, were reported to the surveillance system.
The risk was higher in those who had received few antenatal care visits or who were poorly educated.
For singleton pregnancies, the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) for a stillbirth among women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy compared with normotensive women was 3.1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.85-3.37).
The aRR for hypertensive disorder subtypes was: 6.66 (95% CI: 5.57-7.96) for superimposed preeclampsia; 4.15 (95% CI: 3.81-4.52) for preeclampsia or eclampsia; 2.32 (95% CI: 1.87-2.88) for chronic hypertension; and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.08-1.36) for gestational hypertension.
For multiple pregnancies, the association between stillbirths and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy was not significant, except for superimposed preeclampsia (aRR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.28-2.97).

Conclusion
Better quality antenatal care and improved guidelines are needed in China.


Methods
Administrative data were collected on vaccines administered by age group and vaccination coverage surveys were carried out before and after the campaign.

Findings
Overall, 294 054 vaccine doses were administered.
In children aged 6 weeks to 23 months, coverage of the second doses of OPV, DTP-Hib-hepatitis B vaccine and PCV was over 58% and coverage of the third doses of OPV and DTP-Hib-hepatitis B vaccine was over 20%.
Moreover, 61% (5804/9589) of children aged 12 to 23 months had received two PCV doses and 90% (25933/28764) aged 24 to 59 months had received one dose.

Conclusion
To sustain high coverage, routine immunization must be reinforced.


Approach
The National Steering Committee Members designed and implemented a screening process, and local facilitators and health-care workers collected health and lifestyle data.
The WHO/International Society of Hypertension risk assessment was used on villagers older than 40 years to identify people at high risk of noncommunicable disease.

Local setting
Samoa is a small island developing state with increasing morbidity and mortality due to noncommunicable diseases.
A national representative survey indicated that 50.1% (595/1188) of the Samoan adult population is at high risk of such diseases.

Relevant changes
The teams collected data from 2234 adults.
Community members developed an awareness programme to improve understanding of lifestyle risk factors.


Background
Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) replaced unfractionated heparin (UFH) in multiple indications.

Results
We identified 5322 prevalent and incident patients with chronic hemodialysis.

Conclusion
LMWH was not associated with a higher minor, major, or total bleeding risk.
The convenience of use and predictable effect made LMWH a suitable alternative to UFH in hemodialysis.


Background
In this study, we assessed time trends in use of sperm cryopreservation by men with TC from 1990 to 2013 in France.

Methods
Trends in the incidence of sperm cryopreservation were estimated through two statistical models: the commonly used Poisson regression model and the Verhulst model.

Results
However, since 2005, the observed sperm cryopreservation rate seems to be attenuating.


Presenting concerns of the patient
Predating the nausea and vomiting was a history of daily marijuana use.

Interventions
Abstinence from marijuana use resulted in complete resolution of symptoms.

Outcomes
The patient elected to discontinue dialysis and was still alive 7 months later.


Methods
A point prevalence survey was conducted between June and November 2015 for patients admitted to hospitals with at least 30 acute care beds.
Adherence to regional and local treatment guidelines was assessed.

Results
Twelve of the 13 eligible hospitals participated, and a total of 1499 patient charts were examined.
The overall prevalence of antimicrobial use was 30.6% (458/1499).
The prevalence of antimicrobial use differed significantly according to area of specialty, with the highest prevalence occurring in intensive care wards (47.2%, 50/106) and surgical wards (43.4%, 179/412), as compared with medical wards (27.9%, 192/687) and "other" specialty wards (11.1%, 32/289) (p < 0.001).
Among the 520 indications for antimicrobial use, the most common was respiratory tract infection (81 or 15.6%).
In total, 660 antimicrobial agents were prescribed to the 458 patients; a third of these patients (152 or 33.2%) received more than 1 antimicrobial agent.
The class of antimicrobials most frequently prescribed was "other beta-lactam antimicrobials" (31.2%, 206/660).
The majority of antimicrobials (62.0%, 409/660) were prescribed for administration via the parenteral route.
Adherence to regional treatment guidelines was 29.9% (26 of 87 indications analyzed).

Conclusions
Antimicrobial agents were prescribed for about one-third of acute care patients in Nova Scotia.


Background
Medication preparation and administration are higher-risk steps in the medication management process.

Methods
First- and second-year pharmacy students were recruited as participants.
The study was divided into 2 phases: comprehension (Phase 1) and long-term recall (Phase 2).
In Phase 1, a slideshow of the 9 pictograms was presented to participants, who were asked to write the meaning of and required action for each pictogram.
The intended meaning of each pictogram was then presented to the participants.
Four weeks later, long-term recall was assessed in Phase 2 of the study using the same method.
The meaning and required action that participants provided for each pictogram were reviewed by 3 independent raters.

Results
A total of 101 pharmacy students participated in Phase 1 and 67 in Phase 2.
In Phase 1, 4 pictograms met the 67% threshold for comprehension.
In Phase 2, after training, 7 of the 9 pictograms were validated.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of prospective data from networked ISAEC clinics in Thunder Bay, Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario.

RESULTS
Overall 422 patients, representing 10% of all ISAEC patients in the study period, were referred for surgical assessment.
The average wait times for surgical assessment were 5.4, 4.3 and 2.2 weeks at the metropolitan, urban and rural centres, respectively.

CONCLUSION
The greatest reductions were noted in the rural setting.


Methods
We conducted a qualitative study from May to October 2016 using semi-structured telephone interviews (mean duration 29 min) with general surgeons in Ontario.
We analyzed the data using established techniques of thematic analysis.

Results
We interviewed 22 general surgeons.
Preservation of reputation and quality care, commitment and succession planning, and retirement planning were dominant themes.
Logistical barriers and financial insecurity led to retirement delay.

Conclusion
Surgeons begin to plan for retirement both early and late in their careers.
Opportunities to support surgeons at all career stages in their retirement planning require further exploration.


Background
There are currently no validated instruments in the orthopedic literature for assessing the healing of acute surgical wounds.

Methods
The databases MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane reviews and CINAHL were searched.
Articles that described objective assessment of acute incisional wounds were included.
Items for the wound-assessment tool were then extracted from eligible studies based on the frequency of reporting.
A multidisciplinary panel of wound experts compiled the items into an initial tool to assess key domains of wound healing.
The items were reduced through several iterations of panel discussion.

Results
Our search strategy yielded 3743 results, which were screened by title and abstract.
Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review for the development of the wound-assessment tool, and 10 domains were extracted based on frequency of reporting.


METHODS
We reviewed the medical records of all patients with hip fracture in Calgary who received Octaplex between 2009 and 2015.
Timing of admission, Octaplex administration and hip fracture surgery were recorded.
Mortality and cardiac, thrombotic and orthopedic complications were assessed.

RESULTS
The median time from admission to surgery was 22 hours.

CONCLUSION
We caution against administrering both FFP and a PCC in patients for warfarin reversal.
Octaplex is effective for rapidly reversing warfarin anticoagulation and reducing delays to hip fracture surgery.
Further study comparing Octaplex to reversal using only vitamin K is required.


Results
The sample was constituted of 75 boys (93.8%) and 5 girls (6.3%), who spent an average of 55.8 hours (SD = 27.22) per week on internet for non-school or professional activities.
Almost all of these youths (97.5%) presented a co-occurring mental health disorder, and more than 70% had seeked help last year for a psychological problem.
show that 92.6% feel their internet use significantly hinders their family relationships, and 50% feel it impedes their social relationships.

CONCLUSIONS
This study shows the multiple difficulties experienced by adolescents in need of a treatment for their PIU.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
- PIU adolescents are mainly boys who report problematic use of video games.


Methods
The study population was all men and women (36 187) aged over 30 years living in Balcova from October 2007 to May 2009.
Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between socioeconomic characteristics and smoking status.

Results
Of the 36 187 study subjects, 16 080 (44%) agreed to participate and 15 174 (42%) with complete data were evaluated.
The majority were women (66.2%); mean ages of men and women were 53.1 (SD 13.1) and 51.3 (SD 13.2) respectively.
Current smoking was higher in men (41.7% versus 31.2% of women), and more men were ex-smokers (33.1% versus 13.5% of women) but more women had never smoked (55.3% versus 25.2% of men).
For women, being married and having low educational level were associated with current smoking and previous smoking (P < 0.05).
Current smoking was also more frequent among working women (P < 0.05).
For men, low educational level and occupational class were associated with being a current smoker and an ex-smoker (P < 0.05).

Conclusions
Smoking habits were different in men and women.
Socioeconomic factors should always be considered when developing smoking cessation policies.


Title
Adapting life to the reality of diabetes.

Background
Diabetes is one of the most challenging and burdensome chronic diseases of the 21st century.
Adaptation to disease is a mental, multidimensional, interactive process and is influenced by social and cultural factors.
It should be explained in the cultural context of each society with qualitative studies.

Results
The core variable showed the way participants adapted to diabetes.


Background
In 2010, Qatar adopted the target of reducing hepatitis B prevalence to < 1% in children by 2015.
It is estimated that 4.3 million individuals are living with HBV infection in the Region.

Methods
We carried out this cross-sectional study in Qatar during the academic year 2015/16.
Blood was collected by finger prick and tested using the point-of-care test/rapid test.
A self-administered, precoded questionnaire was used to assess parent/guardian knowledge about HBV and collect information on the child's HBV vaccination coverage.

Results
Children were exposed to various hepatitis B risk practices.


Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease with complex causes, manifestations, complications and management.

Methods
This descriptive and analytical study was conducted in 2013.
The latest data available were collected from the Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance System of East Azerbaijan Province (2007).
Data were analysed using SPSS version 19.

Results
To test for generalization, ANN and logistic regression were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
The AUC was 0.726 (SE = 0.025) and 0.717 (SE = 0.026) for logistic regression and ANN, respectively (P < 0.001).


Background
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a commonly prescribed drug class used to inhibit gastric acid secretion.
They are prescribed for both treatment and prophylaxis of several gastrointestinal conditions.
Long-term care home (LTCH) residents represent a population in which the long-term adverse effects of PPIs can be significant and PPI deprescribing should be considered when appropriate.

Methods
This cross-sectional, multisite chart review involved LTCH residents who had an active PPI prescription during October 2016.
A convenience sample of 150 charts was randomly selected, and the appropriateness of PPI deprescribing was determined using Canadian guidelines.

Results
Three of the selected charts were excluded because of missing information.
Of the 147 residents included in the chart review, 93 (63%) were candidates for deprescribing.
PPI use for gastroesophageal reflux disease for more than 8 weeks without a deprescribing attempt in the past year was the most frequently observed opportunity for deprescribing (49/93 [53%]).
Twenty-nine residents (20%) had no documented indication for PPI use.
Thirteen residents (9%) had had a fall within the past 30 days, and 53 (36%) had a prescription for vitamin B12 supplements and/or had low serum vitamin B12 levels.


Background
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have proven clinical efficacy for a variety of indications.
However, there is emerging evidence of adverse events associated with their long-term use.

Methods
The impact of these interventions was assessed using a qualitative survey of health care practitioners.

Results
Of the 258 patients whose charts were reviewed, 175 had a PPI prescription before hospital admission, and 83 were initiated on PPI therapy during their hospital stay.
Overall, 94 (36%) of the patients were receiving PPIs without an appropriate indication.
Community-acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infections were the most common adverse events potentially associated with PPI use.
In-service sessions and educational resources on PPI prescribing were reported to affect the clinical practice of 24 (52%) of the 46 survey respondents.


Study Selection
and Data Extraction

Data Synthesis
Four randomized controlled trials, 4 cohort studies, 3 pre-post studies, and 1 quasi-randomized controlled trial were included in the review, representing a total of 1837 patients.
Improvements to medication adherence (n = 6 studies), morbidity (n = 4), costs (n = 2), and medication errors (n = 2) were reported.

Conclusion
Transplant programs need to invest more in this resource.


Background
Lower torso hemorrhage is a significant cause of death from injuries in combat.

Methods
We designed a novel, balloon-led device using common commercial materials.
Thin latex rubber was reassembled in cylindrical conformation aligned to the shape of the aorta and invaginated into vinyl tubing.
The device was also tested on a perfused human cadaveric model.

Results
Flow was occluded with the balloon up to an average of 561.1 ± 124.3 mm Hg.
The device was effective in occluding the distal aorta of a perfused human cadaver.

Conclusion
This novel, high-volume, low-pressure device can occlude the distal aorta in a simulated human aorta model, cadaveric porcine model and perfused human cadaver.


Background
The Canadian Armed Forces deployed a Role 2 Medical Treatment Facility (R2MTF) to Iraq in November 2016 as part of Operation IMPACT.
We compared the multinational interoperability required of this R2MTF with that of similar facilities previously deployed by Canada or other nations.

Methods
We reviewed data (Nov. 4, 2016, to Oct. 3, 2017) from the electronic Disease and Injury Surveillance Report and the Daily Medical Situation Report.
We reviewed the literature to identify utilization profiles for other MTFs over the last 20 years.

Results
In total, 1487 patients were assessed.
Trauma and disease non-battle injuries accounted for 44% and 51% of patient encounters, respectively.
Other than dental conditions, musculoskeletal disorders accounted for most presentations.
Fifty-seven units of fresh frozen plasma and 64 units of packed red blood cells were used, and the walking blood bank was activated 7 times.
Mass casualty activations involved coordination of health care and logistical resources from more than 12 countries.
In addition to host nation military and civilian casualties, patients from 15 different countries were treated with similar frequency.

Conclusion
The experience of the Canadian R2MTF in Iraq demonstrates the importance of multinational interoperability in providing cohesive medical care in coalition surgical facilities.


Background
The goal of this study was to describe the rate, severity and impact of UAE caused by an AP-IED.

Results
We found that UEA (8 above elbow, 19 below elbow, 1 through elbow, 3 hand, 15 digit(s)) was much more prevalent with AP-IED than with APM (40% v. 6%, p < 0.001).
The fatality rate was higher in patients with UEA than in those without (12 [30%] v. 7 [12%], p = 0.022).

Conclusion
Upper-extremity amputation is more prevalent with AP-IED than APM.
Presence of UEA is associated with more severe injury and increased risk of death in AP-IED victims.


Background
We hypothesized that aerosolized indomethacin may reduce pulmonary inflammation and ALI in a rat model of BCT.

Methods
Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and received a tracheotomy for administration of aerosolized medication through a catheter.
The BCT procedure involved free-dropping a hollow metal weight (200 g) from a height of 25.5, 38.3 or 51.2 cm onto the right thorax.
We administered 1 mg/kg of indomethacin or 1 mL/kg of saline intratracheally 15 minutes after BCT.
The sham group had a similar procedure without the exposure to BCT and treatment.

Results
The rats’ mean arterial pressure and heart rate dropped immediately postimpact but recovered close to that of the sham group after 30 minutes in both control and treatment groups.
Compared to BCT alone, indomethacin significantly reduced the total protein level in the lungs (1.06 ± 0.39 mg/mL v. 3.75 ± 1.95 mg/mL, p = 0.006) and alveolar FD-70 leak (0.23 ± 0.19 μg/mL v. 0.53 ± 0.19 μg/mL, p = 0.02).
Indomethacin also significantly attenuated the acute inflammatory response in percent PMN (13.33 ±7.5% v. 28.0 ± 12.96%, p = 0.04).
Tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 decreased in the indomethacin group, but the decreases were not significant compared with other groups.


Introduction
Little is documented concerning the clinical practice of emergency care in low- and middle-income countries.
The lack of structural models presents serious obstacles to the development of effective emergency care services.
This study provides such a model by describing the clinical practice at the emergency centre of the Centre Hôpitalier Universitaire de Mahajanga in Madagascar.

Methods
Archived chart data were extracted into a computer database.
Data included: age, sex, date, diagnostic investigations, procedures, medications, and diagnosis.

Results
727 charts were reviewed, averaging eight patients per day.
The three most frequent pathologies observed were trauma, gastrointestinal, and infectious disease.
A total of 392 received diagnostic investigations.
These were chiefly complete blood counts (n = 218), blood glucose (n = 155) and ECG (n = 92).
Chest X-rays (n = 83), extremity X-rays (n = 55) and skull/face X-rays (n = 44) comprised the most common imaging.
Ultrasounds were primarily abdominal (n = 9), renal/genitourinary (n = 6), and obstetric (n = 2).
Therapeutic interventions were performed in 564 patients, most commonly intravenous access (n = 452) and wound/orthopaedic care (n = 185).
Medications were administered to 568 patients, mostly anti-inflammatory/analgesics (n = 463) and antibiotics (n = 287).

Conclusion
This is the first descriptive study of the clinical practice of emergency medicine in Mahajanga, Madagascar.
It provides both the Malagasy and international medical communities with an objective analysis of the practice of emergency care in Madagascar from both diagnostic and therapeutic standpoints.
Emergency care here focuses on the management of traumatic injury and infectious disease.
The diagnostic imaging, pharmacologic and procedural therapeutic interventions reflect the burdens placed upon this institution by these diseases.
We hope this study will provide guidance for the further development of Malagasy-specific emergency care systems.


Methods
Data from Trauma Unit patients are entered into a prospective; UKZN approved (BE207-09) Trauma Database.
Data on 65 admissions between April and December 2014 were reviewed to determine the arrival cuff pressure and tube position.
Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and Student's t-test for continuous data.

Results
Most patients had sustained motor vehicle related trauma, with a male predominance.
Equal numbers were intubated pre-hospital versus the in-hospital group.
There were fatal complications related to supra-glottic intubations resulting in aspiration pneumonia, highlighting the need for X-ray confirmation of tube position.

Conclusion
Before inter-facility transfer ETT position should be confirmed radiologically.


Introduction
Emergency care is an essential component of health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
We sought to assess the availability of resources to provide emergency care at a second-level hospital in Ghana.

Methods
Responses to quantitative questions were described.
Qualitative responses were examined by content analysis.

Results
Assessment revealed marked deficiencies in many essential items and services.
However, several successes were identified, such as laboratory capacity.

Conclusion
This study identified opportunities to improve the care of patients with emergency conditions at the Police Hospital in Ghana.


Introduction
Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) have shown benefit for clinical, organisational, and societal outcomes.

Methods
Records from July 2012 to June 2013 were examined.

Results
3488 patients visited the EC in the month of July 2012.
The remaining months of Aug 2012-June 2013 had an average trauma load of 8%.

Conclusion
In the long run, efforts should be made to convert to a complete EMR to avoid the many pitfalls associated with handling paper records.


Introduction
Data from Zambia, adjacent to Botswana, were used for comparison.

Results
The opposite was not observed; annual changes in motor vehicle crash fatality rates did not predict annual GDP changes.

Conclusion
Road crash fatalities increased in recent decades in both Zambia and Botswana.
Evidence-based investments in road safety interventions should be concomitant with economic development.


Introduction
In high-income countries, injury is the most common cause of non-obstetric death among pregnant women.
However, the injury risk during pregnancy has not been well characterized for many developing countries including Ghana.
Our study described maternal and fetal outcomes after injury at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi, Ghana, and identified associations between the prevalence of poor outcomes and maternal risk factors.

Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study to identify pregnant women treated for injury over a 12-month period at KATH in Kumasi, Ghana.
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population.
We identified the association between poor outcomes and maternal risk factors using multivariable Poisson regression.

Results
There were 134 women with documented pregnancy who sought emergency care for injury (1.1% of all injured women).
The leading injury mechanisms were motor vehicle collision (23%), poisoning (21%), and fall (19%).
Assault was implicated in 3% of the injuries.
Eleven women (8%) died from their injuries.
The prevalence of poor fetal outcomes: fetal death, distress or premature birth, was high (61.9%).
One in four infants was delivered prematurely following maternal injury.

Conclusions
Injury is an important cause of maternal morbidity and poor fetal outcomes.
Poisoning, often in an attempt to terminate pregnancy, was a common occurrence among pregnant women treated for injury in Kumasi.


Introduction
Injuries account for 10% of the global burden of disease, resulting in approximately 5.8 million deaths annually.
Trauma registries are an important tool in the development of a trauma system; however, limited resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) make the development of high-quality trauma registries challenging.

Methods
This paper outlines our methods for identifying and locating patients and their medical records using pragmatic and locally appropriate record linkage techniques.
A prehospital database was queried to identify patients transported to University Teaching Hospital - Kigali, Rwanda from December 2012 through February 2015.
Demographic information was recorded and used to create a five-factor identification index, which was then used to search OpenClinic GA, an online open source hospital information system.
The medical record number and archive number obtained from OpenClinic GA were then used to locate the physical medical record for data extraction.

Results
A total of 1668 trauma patients were transported during the study period.


Introduction
Injury accounts for 9.6% of the global mortality burden, disproportionately affecting those living in low- and middle-income countries.
In an effort to improve trauma care in Rwanda, the Ministry of Health developed a prehospital service, Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente (SAMU), and established an emergency medicine training program.
However, little is known about patients receiving prehospital and emergency trauma care or their outcomes.

Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted at University Teaching Hospital - Kigali, the primary trauma centre in Rwanda.
Data was included on all injured patients transported by SAMU from December 2012 to February 2015.
SAMU's prehospital database was linked to hospital records and data were collected using standardised protocols by trained abstractors.
Demographic information, injury characteristics, acute care, hospital course and outcomes were included.

Results
1668 patients were transported for traumatic injury during the study period.
The majority (77.7%) of patients were male.
The median age was 30 years.
48.8% of patients sustained injuries in two or more anatomical regions.
40.1% of patients were admitted to the hospital and 78.1% required surgery.
The overall mortality rate was 5.5% with nearly half of hospital deaths occurring in the emergency centre.

Conclusion
A linked prehospital and hospital database provided critical epidemiological information describing trauma patients in a low-resource setting.
Blunt trauma from motor vehicle collisions involving young males constituted the majority of traumatic injury.
Among this cohort, hospital resource utilisation was high as was mortality.
This data can help guide the implementation of interventions to improve trauma care in the Rwandan setting.


Methods
EC staff were asked about calendar year 2014.
Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics, including proportions and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR).

Results
Sixteen of 17 ECs participated (94% response rate).
Participating ECs were either in hospitals (69%) or health centres (31%).
ECs had a median of 53,399 visits per year (IQR 15,000-97,895).
Fourteen (88%) ECs had a contiguous layout, and the other two (12%) were non-contiguous.
Overall, eight (53%) had access to cardiac monitors and 11 (69%) had a 24/7 clinical laboratory available.
Only 1 (6%) EC had a dedicated CT scanner, while 2 (13%) others had limited access through their hospital.
The typical EC length-of-stay was between 1 and 6 h (44%).
The most commonly available specialists were general surgeons, with 9 (56%) ECs having them available for in-person consultation.
No ECs had a plastic surgeon or psychiatrist available.
Overall, 75% of ECs reported running at overcapacity.

Discussion
Swaziland ECs were predominantly contiguous and running at overcapacity, with high patient volumes and limited resources.
The limited access to technology and specialists are major challenges.
We believe that these data support greater resource allocation by the Swaziland government to the emergency care sector.


Introduction
In South Africa's high injury prevalent setting, it is imperative that injury mortality is kept to a minimum.
The CRASH-2 trial showed that Tranexamic acid (TXA) in severe injury reduces mortality.
Implementation of this into injury protocols has been slow despite the evidence.
The 2013 Western Cape Emergency Medicine Guidelines adopted the use of TXA.
This study aims to describe compliance.

Methods
A retrospective study of TXA use in adult injury patients presenting to Khayelitsha Hospital was done.
A sample of 301 patients was randomly selected from Khayelitsha's resuscitation database and data were supplemented through chart review.
The primary endpoint was compliance with local guidance: systolic blood pressure <90 or heart rate >110 or a significant risk of haemorrhage.
Injury Severity Score (ISS) was used as a proxy for the latter.
ISS >16 was interpreted as high risk of haemorrhage and ISS <8 as low risk.
Linear regression and Fischer's Exact test were used to explore assumptions.

Results
Overall compliance was 58% (172 of 295).
For those without an indication, this was 96% (172 of 180).
Of the 115 patients who had an indication, only eight (18%) received the first dose of TXA and none received a follow-up infusion.
Increased TXA use was associated only with ISS >15 (p < 0.001).

Discussion
TXA is not used in accordance with local guidelines.
It was as likely not to be used when indicated than when not indicated.
Further investigation is needed to understand the barriers to administration.


Introduction
Emergency Centre (EC) crowding has globally been recognised to adversely affect patients, staff and visitors.
Although more reliable, resource restrictions render more detailed flow studies less achievable.

Methods
A prospective, cross-sectional design was used.

Results
A total of 16,353 people were counted during the study period.
On average, 6370 (39%) of the groups were staff, 5231 (32%) were patients and 4752 (29%) were visitors.


Background
We sought to describe surgical care access among homeless patients in a Canadian tertiary care setting.

Methods
We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics.

Results
A surgical referral was initiated in 129 emergency department visits for 97 patients (77 men [79%], mean age 46.7 yr).
Most patients lived in shelters (77 [79%]) and had provincial health insurance (82 [84%]), but only 35 (36%) had a primary care physician.
The mean number visits for any reason was 7.9 (standard deviation 13.7) (range 1–106).
The majority of surgical referrals (83 [64.3%]) were for traumatic injuries, and the most frequently consulted service (52 [40.3%]) was orthopedic surgery.


Background
Bacterial infection and inflammation of the testis impairs fertility, yet an understanding of inflammatory responses of the testis is incomplete.
We are interested in identifying gene pathways involved in the detection and clearance of infectious microbes in the male reproductive tract.
The purpose of this study was to identify hypoxia and inflammatory gene pathways that contribute to antimicrobial protection of the testis and to consider possible cross-talk and interactions between these pathways.
Inflammation was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using P. aeruginosa or E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
Levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1α) protein and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured, and hypoxia and inflammatory gene expression patterns in testis were analyzed by gene expression profiling using real-time quantitative PCR arrays.

Results
In LPS-treated rats, HIF-1α protein increased with no change in Hif-1α mRNA.
Five hypoxia pathway genes (Angptl4, Egr1, Ier3, Pai1, and Glut1), and 11 inflammatory pathway genes (Ccl12, Cc13, Cd14, Cxcl10, Icam1, Il10, Il1b, Il6, Nfkbia, Tlr2, Tnf) up-regulated after 3 h of inflammation.
Angptl4, Ccl12, Cc13, Cd14, Egr1, Nfkbia, Tlr2, and Tnf remained elevated at 6 h.
Six genes were up-regulated at 6 h only (Bhlhe40, C3, Jak2, Nlrp3, Slc11a1, Tlr1).
One gene (Tlr5) was down-regulated after 3 h and no genes at 6 h.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results suggest a decrease in NF-κB binding activity following LPS treatment.

Conclusions
Testicular HIF-1α is up-regulated following LPS-induced inflammation.


INTRODUCTION
Prurigo is one of the most common dermatological conditions during HIV infection and AIDS.
It appears as an immunosuppression marker associated with HIV infection.

RESULTS
We collected 121 cases of prurigo.
The elementary lesions associated with prurigo were seropapules (40.2%), vesiculo-crusts (13%), excoriated papules (33.3%), lichenified papules (10.8%), and cicatricial lesions (2.7%).
The prurigo was generalized in 68.5% of cases and localized in 31.24%.

CONCLUSION
Early detection and rapid antietroviral therapy can reduce the frequency of prurigo in PLHIV.


Methods
A six-month prospective observational study was conducted in the resuscitation unit of Khayelitsha Hospital.

Results
A total of 2324 patient admissions were analysed.
The mean age was 36.9 years with a male predominance (n = 1367, 58.8%).
Most patients were triaged into high-acuity categories (n = 1626, 70%).
HIV infection was the most common comorbidity (n = 530, 22.8%).
Acute medical (n = 1181, 50.8%) and trauma-related patients (n = 928, 39.9%) dominated the cohort.
The median length of stay was 195 min and 502 (21.6%) patients were transferred to higher levels of care.
There were 74 (3.2%) deaths.

Conclusion
This study yields novel epidemiological data of emergency care in a district-level emergency centre.


Methods
We performed a two-stage cluster survey.

Finding
Coverage with two doses was 53.0% (769/1451), 91.1% (1010/1106) and 78.8% (186/236), in the three strata, respectively.
The most common reason for non-vaccination was absence from home during the campaign.
Most interviewees liked the novel distribution strategies.

Conclusion
Community engagement and simplified delivery procedures were critical for success.
Off-label, out-of-cold-chain administration of oral cholera vaccine should be considered as an effective strategy for achieving high coverage in hard-to-reach communities.
Nevertheless, coverage and effectiveness must be monitored over the short and long term.


Objective
To determine the cost of Zimbabwe's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination demonstration project.

Methods
The government of Zimbabwe conducted the project from 2014-2015, delivering two doses of HPV vaccine to 10-year-old girls in two districts.
School delivery was the primary vaccination strategy, with health facilities and outreach as secondary strategies.
A retrospective cost analysis was conducted from the provider perspective.
Financial costs (government expenditure) and economic costs (financial plus the value of existing or donated resources including vaccines) were calculated by activity, per dose and per fully immunized girl.

Results
The mean financial cost per dose was US$ 19.76 and per fully immunized girl was US$ 40.03 (economic costs were US$ 45.00 and US$ 91.19, respectively).


Approach
In 2013, the programme incorporated antivenoms to improve stock management and avoid wastage due to stock expiry.

Local setting
Individual hospitals stocked antivenoms, which often expired before use.

Relevant changes
Today, the National Health Security Office finances and manages the centralized procurement of antidotes and antivenoms and all Thai patients have a right to antidotes regardless of health insurance.
National and subnational stock levels are determined based on demand, treatment urgency and cost.
A web-based system, which incorporates geographical information, was introduced for requesting antidotes and antivenoms.
Poison centres provide training, 24-hour consultation services and outcome monitoring.
Antidotes and antivenoms are now readily available and used correctly and clinical management has improved.


Background
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging accurately and precisely measures left ventricular (LV) mass and function.
The concentration of serum adiponectin, a cardiovascular biomarker, increases in cardiac failure, its production being enhanced by B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and both serum adiponectin and BNP concentrations decline posttransplantation.

Measurements
Subjects underwent CMR with a 1.5-tesla whole-body magnetic resonance scanner using a phased-array cardiac coil and retrospective vectorographic gating.
Serum total adiponectin and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) concentrations were measured at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months.

Results
Changes in LV mass were associated with systolic blood pressure (p=0.0008) and mean LV mass (p=0.0001).
Adiponectin (-7.1 ± 11.3 µg/ml [TR] versus -0.11 ± 7.9 µg/ml [dialysis], p<0.0001) and NT-proBNP (-3,811 ± 8,130 pg/ml [TR] versus 1,665 ± 20,013 pg/ml [dialysis], p<0.0001) were decreased after transplantation.

Limitations
Few biomarkers of cardiac function were measured to fully contextualize their role during changing kidney function.
The CMR timing in relation to dialysis was not standardized.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The Statistics Canada Health Person-Oriented Information Database, consisting of hospital discharge records for seven provinces from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Hospital Morbidity Database, was used.
Times to death in hospital and to revascularization procedures were counted from the admission date of the first AMI visit.
Mixed model regression analyses with random slopes were used to assess the relationship between early revascularization and mortality.
The overall rate of revascularization within 30 days of AMI increased significantly from 12.5% in 1995 to 37.4% in 2003, while the 30-day mortality rate decreased significantly from 13.5% to 10.6%.
There was a linearly decreasing relationship - higher regional use of revascularization was associated with lower mortality in both men and women.


CONCLUSION
Experience in urology was comparable across the distributed sites and was congruent with teaching objectives.
Students were comfortable with the clinical scenarios deemed most important in the literature.


Summary
Granulomatous meningoencephalitis (GME) is an acute, progressive, and often fatal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, affecting mainly small and toy dog breeds.
A definitive diagnosis of GME can only be achieved through histopathologic examination of samples collected after death.
This retrospective study describes transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TDS) findings in dogs with confirmed clinical histopathology of GME.
Eleven dogs were selected for this study.
Sonographic findings in B-mode demonstrated diffuse decreased brain parenchyma echogenicity in 9 dogs, ventriculomegaly in 8 dogs, brain atrophy in 4 dogs, and hyperechoic focal lesions in 6 dogs.
Color Doppler imaging revealed more obvious vessels of the arterial circle in 10 dogs.
Spectral Doppler examination was performed in 10 dogs to detect the 6 major cerebral arteries of interest.
The examination showed normal and high resistive index (RI) values in the outlined arteries.
The TDS findings were consistent with pathology found on postmortem examination.


Summary
The diagnosis and treatment of double intestinal intussusception in 3 pups with persistent vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, anemia, leucocytosis, and electrolyte imbalance are described.
Ultrasonography confirmed intussusception and laparotomy revealed double intussusceptions.
Intussusceptions were corrected by manual reduction in 1 pup and intestinal resection and anastomosis in 2 pups.
Two pups survived and 1 pup died on the 4th day after surgery.


RESULTS
From the total visits through the year (July 15, 2008 to July 15, 2009), 1541 (79.6%) patients were approached for participation; 8 (0.5%) declined.
The final sample size was 1533 patient visits.
Four hundred sixty-nine visits (30.6%) were potentially appropriate for TH based on geography.
According to clinic physicians, only 51 of these 469 visits (10.9%) were appropriate for TH.
The main reasons for being inappropriate were the need for physical examination (n=238, 57.0%), imaging (n=57, 13.6%), or issues regarding sexuality/privacy (n=45, 10.8%).
Of the 51 appropriate visits, 28 patients/families (55.0%) expressed interest in TH.
Of those not interested in TH, the main reasons included the desire for a face-to-face encounter and the need to coordinate with other health care appointments.

CONCLUSION
Currently, TH appears to be appropriate for only a small subset of patients/families.


INTERVENTIONS
Each curriculum component was evaluated with surveys using a five-point Likert scale.


FINDINGS
Institutional arrangements pose significant barriers to PHC reform as envisioned by the WHO.


RESULTS
Mean age was 67 years and 55.3% were female.


RESULTS
Of these patients, 111 (75%) were discharged to an in-patient rehabilitation unit.
Two hundred forty-nine (62.9%) patients were not considered candidates.


RESULTS
Evidence overwhelmingly suggests that BD typically onsets in adolescence and early adulthood, with the depressive polarity of the illness dominating the early course.
Non-specific childhood antecedents have been noted in some high-risk individuals.


METHODS
Thirty-nine children were followed prospectively every two years from 4-6 years to 12-14 years.


METHODS
This focused review is designed to briefly outline three different etiological pathways described in the literature.

RESULTS
CONCLUSIONS


RESULTS
Parental emotional problems predicted the early-adolescence anxiety increase trajectory in girls.
Prevalence of anxiety disorders and depression during adolescence and in early adulthood was higher in both the mid-adolescence limited and the mid-adolescence anxiety increase trajectory.

CONCLUSIONS
The longitudinal course of anxiety symptoms during adolescence was characterized by three distinct gender-specific developmental trajectories.
The most at-risk trajectory in girls was the mid-adolescence anxiety increase trajectory, and in boys the mid-adolescence limited trajectory.
None of the environmental (i.e., child, family and peer) factors distinguished the at-risk trajectories from the other trajectories.


RESULTS
Rates of unipolar depression are low before puberty, but rise from the early teens, especially among girls.
Concurrent comorbidity with both disruptive and emotional disorders is common, especially among younger children; across age, youth depression may be preceded by both anxiety and disruptive behaviour disorders, and increase risk for alcohol problems.
Adolescent depression is associated with a range of adverse later outcomes including suicidality, problems in social functioning and poor physical and mental health.
Across development, a family history of depression and exposure to stressful life events are the most robust risk factors for depression.
Familial transmission involves both psychosocial and heritable processes; genetic and environmental influences also combine to influence risk.
Neurocognitive and neuroendocrine pathways have been established, but contributors to the adolescent rise in risk, and the female preponderance later in development, remain to be clarified.
Depressed youth benefit from psychological therapy or antidepressant medication or their combination; however, treatment effects are moderate.


CONCLUSIONS
Developmental research has contributed significantly to the understanding of aetiology and treatment of substance-use disorders.


METHODS
This is a selective review focusing primarily on prospective follow-up studies.
Relevant publications were selected by searching the MEDLINE and PubMed databases using keywords: ADHD, development, preschool, adolescent, adult, follow up, outcome, long-term, predictors, and treatment.

RESULTS
Presentation of ADHD and associated impairments evolve across development, as do outcome predictors.
In early development, in addition to genetics, some forms of prenatal adversity increase the risk for ADHD.
In preschool years, symptom severity, cognitive function, and family factors become significant predictors of school age outcomes.
These continue to predict long-term outcomes in school aged children, and comorbidity emerges as another significant long-term outcome predictor at this stage.


RESULTS
Two open label studies also reported positive effects in ADHD.
A pilot study in children with enuresis reported significant reduction in wetting frequency.


RESULTS
The patient presented, initially, with tremors, severe urinary retention and constipation.

CONCLUSIONS
Conversion symptoms often occur in cases of severe psychosocial stresses including sexual and physical abuse.


FINDINGS
Rankings were based on overall mean scores derived by averaging the scores for individual criteria.
Experts agreed strongly on the relative importance of the questions in each area.


METHODS
Randomization was blocked, with two clusters in each fieldwork area allocated to vitamin A and two to placebo.
Every 4 weeks, fieldworkers distributed capsules and collected data during home visits.
Verbal autopsies were conducted by field supervisors and reviewed by physicians, who assigned a cause of death.
Analysis was by intention-to-treat, based on cluster of residence, with women eligible for inclusion once they had consistently received the supplement or placebo capsules for 6 months.

FINDINGS
The analysis was based on 581 870 woman-years and 2624 deaths.


METHODS
The outcomes of interest were ART coverage, ART enrolment, ART retention, mortality and transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

FINDINGS
Four studies met the inclusion criteria.
All were conducted in ANC clinics.
Increased ART coverage was also noted in such clinics (RR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.05-1.79; I(2): 83%).
Sensitivity analyses revealed a trend for the national prevalence of HIV infection to explain the heterogeneity in the size of the effect of ART integration on ART coverage (P = 0.13).
Retention in ART was similar in ANC clinics with and without ART integration.


RELEVANT CHANGES
The estimated HIV transmission rate decreased from 9.6% to 2.8%.
Population-based surveys in 2010 and 2011 reported transmission rates of 3.5% and 2.7%, respectively.


RESULTS
A positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result was associated with relatively short hospitalization.

CONCLUSION
The present retrospective study confirms previous reports regarding seasonality and the young age of positive patients.
Factors that indicate nonenteroviral etiology were appropriately also those that influenced hospitalization.


RESULTS
By the end of December 2007, 2263 HIV-positive persons were in care in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and southern Alberta.
Males and females accounted for 1674 (74.0%) and 589 of the cases, respectively.
In 2007, there were 222 new HIV cases to care (37.4% female).


RESULTS
When pregnant women were removed from the analysis, there were no significant differences in the rates of virologic rebound according to sex or immigration status.


CASE
PRESENTAION: A previously healthy 36-year-old woman was admitted with complaints of fever, weakness, night sweats, dry cough and bilateral chest pain.
Her chest auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds and scattered crackles and rhonchi over the inferior zone of the right hemithorax.
Wright and Coombs testing resulted in titres of 1:1280 and 1:640, respectively.
Chest radiography revealed an area of confluent lobar consolidation in the right lower lobe.
Follow-up after one year showed no residual effects from the infection.


RESULTS
Ten studies were reviewed.


OBJECTIVE
Almost all children attained 30 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), and most boys and girls attained 60 min of daily MVPA on weekdays.
Only 60% of fathers and approximately one-half of mothers attained 30 min of daily MVPA on weekdays and weekend days.
Fathers’ involvement in PA with their children was associated with higher MVPA in children.
Parental involvement in PA with their young children, particularly the involvement of fathers, appeared to promote higher levels of MVPA in young children.


RESULTS
There were no dropouts or dose reductions within the first 12 weeks of treatment.


RESULTS
HSV1 was isolated in 73.2% of patients 10 to 39 years of age and in 32% of patients ≥40 years of age.
The difference in rates of HSV1 infection between the 10 to 39 years of age group and the ≥40 years of age group was statistically significant (P<0.001 [χ(2)]).
In a similar Canadian study performed in Nova Scotia, HSV1 was recovered in 53.7% of positive cultures (male, 36.7%; female, 58.1%).
The rates of HSV1 infection reported by this study and the present study were significantly different (P<0.001 [χ(2)] for male, P=0.012 for female).


RESULTS
A total of 591 charts were screened to generate the targeted number of patients.
Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable for the 2 groups, except antibiotic exposure before urine collection was significantly more frequent for the group with negative culture results.
The treatment decision was concordant in 40% (16/40) of the patients with a positive culture result and 85% (34/40) of those with a negative culture result (p < 0.001).
Adverse effects occurred in 2 of the 23 patients with a positive result who received antibiotics that were not indicated.

CONCLUSIONS
Unnecessary days of therapy and adverse effects were more common in patients with a positive culture result.


RESULTS
The mean infusion rate of dexmedetomidine was 0.42 μg/kg per hour (standard deviation 0.17 μg/kg per hour, range 0.05-2 μg/kg per hour).
The median duration of therapy was 20.50 h (range 0.75-854.75 h), and 70 infusions (46%) lasted more than 24 h.
Hypotension (81 [53%]) and bradycardia (38 [25%]) were the most common adverse events and were deemed "probably" attributable to dexmedetomidine in 17 (11%) and 9 (6%) of the treatment courses, respectively.


METHODS
Rates of paediatric hospitalization for empyema and pneumonia (bacterial, viral and all types) were calculated following the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) as a principal diagnosis.
The expected number of hospitalizations after the PCV7 was introduced was estimated on the basis of the observed number of hospitalizations before the introduction of the PCV7.
Incidence rate differences (IRDs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated.
Hospitalization incidence in each study period was expressed as the number of hospitalizations per million (10(6)) person-years.
The population of children aged 0-19 years in Australia from 1998 to 2004 and from 2005 to 2010, as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, was used to calculate the number of person-years in each period.

FINDINGS
Reductions in hospitalizations were observed for all ICD-10 pneumonia codes across all age groups.
The increase in empyema hospitalizations was only significant among children aged 1 to 4 years.


METHODS
Data on cases occurring before and during the national outbreak were obtained from the South African measles surveillance programme, and data on measles immunization and population size, from the District Health Information System.
A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson model was used to investigate the association between the risk of measles in infants in a district and first-dose vaccination coverage, population density, background prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and expected failure of seroconversion.
Model projections were used to identify emerging high-risk areas in 2012.

CONCLUSION
The predictive model developed could be applied to other settings susceptible to sporadic outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.


SUMMARY
Dr. Gitelman was a pioneer in the development of chiropractic science.
He died on October 7, 2012.


RESULTS
112 medical students completed the survey (50% response rate).


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of the spine are most commonly utilized by chiropractors practicing in Ontario.

RESULTS
There were 108 respondents to the survey, giving a response rate of 22.4%.
Diversified technique was the most commonly employed technique used by 90.7% of respondents, followed by trigger point therapy indicated by 57.4% of respondents.


CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review found 13 clinical trials investigating the effect of the menstrual cycle on ACL laxity.
There is evidence to support the hypothesis that the ACL changes throughout the menstrual cycle, with it becoming more lax during the pre-ovulatory (luteal) phase.
Overall, these reviews found statistically significant differences for variation in ACL laxity and injury throughout the menstrual cycle, especially during the pre-ovulatory phase.
Female athletes may need to take precautions in order to reduce the likelihood of ACL injury.
However, the quality of the assessments was low and the evidence is still very limited.
More and better quality research is needed in this area.


SUMMARY
There is currently a paucity of data in the literature regarding the chiropractor's role in the management of symptomatic facet cysts.


METHODS
All the interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.


METHODS
The rats were followed for 24 hours.


RESULTS
Of the children attending appointments, 55% were female and 51% were five years of age or younger.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
During the three years of MCADD surveillance, 46 confirmed cases out of a total of 71 reported cases were found - an average of approximately 15 cases per year.
All cases ascertained by newborn screening were asymptomatic.
There were two deaths, both in jurisdictions without newborn screening for MCADD.
The data support population-based newborn screening for MCADD.


METHODS
Mortality rates and demographic, disease and treatment characteristics were compared in patients who received either ART and MMT or ART only.
Factors associated with mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.


METHODS
Tailored search strings were used to search EMBASE, Medline and PsycINFO.
The grey literature was identified through online grey literature databases.
Experts were consulted to obtain additional studies and data.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled crude mortality rates (CMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).

FINDINGS
Sixty-seven cohorts of people who inject drugs were identified, 14 of them from low- and middle-income countries.
The pooled CMR was 2.35 deaths per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.12-2.58).
SMRs were reported for 32 cohorts; the pooled SMR was 14.68 (95% CI: 13.01-16.35).
It was also higher during off-treatment periods.
Drug overdose and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were the primary causes of death across cohorts.


PROBLEM
In Malaysia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is highly concentrated among people who inject opioids.
For this reason, the country undertook a three-phase roll-out of a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programme.
In Phase 3, described in this paper, MMT was implemented within prisons and retention in care was assessed.


PROBLEM
This has created an enormous demand for trained providers.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Training programmes for individual providers and their trainers were redeveloped and expanded in 2008.


RESULTS
When comparing the total number of axons, the branch to the tibialis anterior had a mean of 3363±1997 axons.
The branch to the popliteus was most similar, with 3317±1467 axons.
When comparing the total number of axons, the branch to the extensor hallucis longus had an average of 2062±2314 axons.
The branch to the lateral gastrocnemius was most similar with 2352±1249 axons and was a suitable donor.


RESULTS
No early or delayed allergic responses were reported.
Overall, a total of 11 patients (14.9%) had minor asymmetries or less than optimal results within the lip augmentation study group.
Among other sites, the most common complaint was undercorrection of the fold or wrinkle.

CONCLUSION
Although the implant is often palpable, rarely does it cause significant visible lumps.
Its use and applications as a semipermanent injectable agent certainly warrant further investigation.


RESULTS
Over the five-year study period, 45.00% of the 888 presentations were published in peer-reviewed journals.
The mean time to publication was 22 months (range 1.00 to 85.90 months).
The Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons had the highest total number of publications (n=161).

CONCLUSIONS
In an effort to improve conversion rates, departments and faculty members must foster a culture that prioritizes publication.


RESULTS
Patient self-efficacy scores ranged from 5 to 9.3 (out of 10).

CONCLUSIONS
Health care providers may need to assume more responsibility in standardizing information dissemination on PMBR.


RESULTS
Of the 307 invitees, 90 surgeons responded, of whom 76 met the inclusion criteria.
Most surgeons (66%) do not perform immediate reconstruction in patients who require postmastectomy radiation.
Expander and implants is their preferred option, followed by free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap.
Thirty-five per cent use the delayed immediate technique in these cases.
For delayed reconstruction of the irradiated patient, the pedicled TRAM is the most common choice.


OBJECTIVE
grip strength and range of motion were compared with the contralateral extremity.

RESULTS
All USO eventually healed.
Overall, pain improved by 47.2% and the mean DASH score after surgery was 37.21.


RESULTS
Forty-two patients (82.4%) completed the survey.


RESULTS
Of the nine patients included in the study, delayed wound healing occurred in 22% of cases.
One patient experienced partial nipple-areolar complex loss on the radiated breast.
Postoperative asymmetry occurred in 77.8% of patients.


METHODS
The yearly costs of training, equipping and deploying CHWs throughout rural sub-Saharan Africa were calculated using data from the literature and from the Millennium Villages Project.
Model assumptions were such as to allow national governments to adapt the CHW subsystem to national needs and to deploy an average of 1 CHW per 650 rural inhabitants by 2015.
The CHW subsystem described was costed by employing geographic information system (GIS) data on population, urban extents, national and subnational disease prevalence, and unit costs (from the field for wages and commodities).
The model is easily replicable and configurable.
Countries can adapt it to local prices, wages, population density and disease burdens in different geographic areas.


METHODS
Demographic, socioeconomic and obstetric data for women aged 15-49 years were extracted from Viet Nam's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey for 2006 (MICS3) and 2010-2011 (MICS4).
These independent variables correspond to the analytical framework of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health.

FINDINGS
Large discrepancies between urban and rural populations were found in both MICS3 and MICS4.
The risk of not giving birth in a health facility increased significantly among ethnic minority women living in rural areas.


METHODS
A retrospective study of patients admitted to the surgical ICU following coronary artery bypass grafting or heart valve replacement was undertaken at the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, a 682-bed tertiary care hospital in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
Management of magnesium, phosphorus, and ionized calcium balance was also compared.
The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was documented, and the safety of the electrolyte repletion protocol was evaluated by determining and comparing proportions of values for serum electrolyte concentration that were above the desired range.

RESULTS
In total, 627 patients were included in the study: 312 in the control group and 315 in the protocol group.
The proportion of patients with 100% of morning values for serum potassium concentration within the normal range was significantly higher in the protocol group than in the control group (66.1% versus 56.8%; p = 0.018).
In the protocol group, significantly more patients received one or more replacement doses of magnesium and phosphorus (p < 0.001).
The proportions of serum electrolyte values above the normal range were similar between the 2 groups, and there was no difference in the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias.


METHODS
Two pharmacists rotated to attend the allo-HCT clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated cancer centre between January and June 2010 (coverage for 1 of 3 clinic days per week).
The pharmacists' primary task was to perform medication reconciliation and to identify and resolve DTPs.
The pharmacists also provided medication education to patients and pharmacy consultations to clinic staff.
Working with the outpatient pharmacy, the pharmacists helped to clarify prescriptions and drug coverage issues.
Medication discrepancies identified and interventions performed by the pharmacists were recorded and were later graded for clinical significance by a panel of clinicians.
Patient and staff satisfaction surveys were conducted at random during the study period.
Barriers to the flow of patient care and other operational issues were documented.

RESULTS
The 2 pharmacists saw a total of 35 patients over 100 visits.
They identified a total of 50 medication discrepancies involving 17 (49%) of the patients and 70 DTPs involving 23 (66%) of the patients.
Thirty-one of the 70 DTPs resulted directly from a medication discrepancy.
Twenty (95%) of the 21 unintentional medication discrepancies and 7 (70%) of the 10 undocumented intentional medication discrepancies were graded as clinically significant or moderately significant.
Satisfaction surveys completed by patients and clinic staff yielded positive responses supporting pharmacists' participation.


METHODS
A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial concentration of propranolol.
Physical compatibility was evaluated in terms of colour, taste, precipitation, and pH.


RESULTS
Four TRALI cases were reported, yielding an incidence rate of 1.8 per 100,000 transfusions.


RESULTS
Of the 214 children in the study, 20 (9.3%, 95% CI 5.3% to 13.4%) had HHA axis suppression.
Odds of HPA axis suppression increased with ICS dose (OR 1.005, 95% CI 1.003 to 1.009, P<0.001).


Results
Responders were more likely to have fewer years in practice than the targeted population in general.


RESULTS
The adjusted risk of suicide was 3 to 18 times higher than age-matched controls.
Affective disorders, borderline personality traits, substance use disorders, impulse control disorders, and anxiety disorders were associated with suicidal thoughts and self-injury.
Screening for suicidal ideation upon entry was associated with a decreased rate of suicide.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the effectiveness of a multimodal afterschool and summer intervention called the Dream-A-World (DAW) Project for a cohort of school-aged Jamaican children from an impoverished, disadvantaged inner-city community in Kingston, Jamaica.
Children were selected by their teachers based on severe disruptive disorders and academic underachievement and compared with a matched control group.
The pilot was a child focused therapeutic modality without parental intervention for disruptive conduct and academic failure.


RESULTS
With exception of the conduct subscale (alpha =.


METHODS
An online questionnaire was distributed to 379 agencies providing child mental health services in Canada.
Spearman's rank correlations were used to determine relationships between variables.

RESULTS
One hundred thirteen agencies returned adequately completed surveys (29.8%).
Collaborating with other agencies/providers and referring families to self-help resources were the most commonly endorsed strategies.
The use of more upstream/ pre-waitlist strategies was related to the ability to meet CPA benchmarks for urgent cases.
No cluster of strategies was related to estimated wait times.
Restriction strategies were most consistently related to agency size.


FINDINGS
Overall, 98.3% of infants had been breastfed.
Breastfeeding was not associated with maternal age or education, ethnicity or household wealth.
Surveyed rates of exclusive and continued breastfeeding were mostly lower than in other nations.

CONCLUSION
Despite efforts to promote breastfeeding in China, rates are very low.


METHODS
The authors used a multivariate hierarchical logistic model to examine the association between the prevalence of childhood stunting over time and certain determinants.


FINDINGS
These trends were found to be largely unaffected by the continent in which the women lived.


FINDINGS
Overall, 49 studies covering 48 cohorts and 30 016 individuals met the inclusion criteria.


RESULTS
Of 932 patients, 621 with hemangiomas and 311 patients with vascular malformations were found in the database.
Hemangiomas were more commonly found in girls (68.5%), and most commonly located on the head and neck (54%), with most patients (72.6%) having only one lesion.
Of the patients with hemangiomas, 14.7% underwent diagnostic imaging investigation and 23.7% received treatment including medications, surgery, pulsed-dye laser or dressings.
The sex distribution among the 311 patients with vascular malformations was almost equal.
Overall, 37.9% of patients underwent diagnostic imaging investigation and 42.4% received treatment - either pulsed-dye laser, surgical excision, sclerotherapy or other treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
Hemangiomas and vascular malformations can occur at any anatomical site.
Vascular anomalies are best managed in a multidisciplinary setting.


RESULTS
Plain 1% lidocaine had a pH of 6.09±0.16, and plain 2% lidocaine had a pH of 6.00±0.27.
Epinephrine-containing solutions were more acidic when they had been previously opened.

CONCLUSION
Lidocaine with epinephrine was approximately 1000 times more acidic than subcutaneous tissue.
The addition of bicarbonate to the local anesthetic solution is simple to perform and is inexpensive.
Surgeons should be more aware of the simplicity and value of buffering with bicarbonate to decrease the pain of injection.


CONCLUSIONS
A high degree of clinical suspicion must be exercised to diagnose this rare condition.
To date, the most successful treatment method is a short course of systemic corticosteroids.


RESULTS
Twenty-five studies reporting on 3207 patients were included in the analysis.
A total of 3576 free-flaps were performed within the following subsites: 1103 head and neck, 2094 breast, 300 limb or body, and 79 nonspecified.
There were only 26 reported flap failures (0.7%).
A total of 3497 venous and 342 arterial coupled anastomoses were performed.
The primary outcome measure was thrombosis rates, and there were 61 venous (1.7%) and 12 arterial (3.6%) thromboses reported.
Mean coupling time was 5 min, and 30 anastomoses (0.8%) were converted to suture.

CONCLUSION
Flap survival and revision-free application of the microvascular coupler occurred in more than 99% of cases.
There is a substantial time savings with coupler use.


RESULTS
The principle pitfall in the form of small neoauricle with or without cupping was reported in five patients (27.77%).
Statistical analysis resulted in χ(2)=4.24 and P=0.04.


INTRODUCTION
Individual institutions govern research ethics applications and each must administer and regulate their own protocols.
Observation
Research ethics applications from the 12 participating centres were compared.

CONCLUSIONS
This may be a more efficient strategy that could help lessen the burden of collaborative research.


INTRODUCTION
Posaconazole prophylaxis in high-risk neutropenic patients prevents invasive fungal infection (IFI).


RESULTS
Positivity was higher among participants who were female, Aboriginal and in contact with children ≤5 years of age.
The overall pH1N1 vaccination rate was 28%.


RESULTS
The cost-effectiveness of vaccination is dependent on the mode of administration, the perspective adopted and the cost of the vaccine.


RESULTS
One hundred forty-two episodes of NVG were found among 133 patients, occurring in 0.48 of 100 admissions.
The median age was two years; 42% were <1 year of age and 41% were immunocompromised.
The most commonly detected pathogen was torovirus (67% of episodes), followed by rotavirus (19%) and adenovirus (9%).
Seventy-five cases (53%) were epidemiologically linked in 32 separate clusters (median cluster size two, range two to four).


RESULTS
In contrast, the expression of PDGF-AA was only stimulated following HCMV infection.


RESULTS
Twelve key informant interviews were performed.
Consensus for questionnaire content was reached through two rounds of the Delphi process.
Eighty-one per cent of respondents would be more comfortable processing specimens if national guidelines existed and were used in their laboratory.


RESULTS
The proportion of newly diagnosed patients who were female increased from 7.5% before 1998 to 21.5% after 1998.
Heterosexual intercourse was the main risk factor for HIV acquisition (43.7%).
Women were less likely than men to have requested HIV testing (20.9% versus 37.8%, P<0.001).
Opt-out pregnancy screening accounted for 12.7% of HIV-positive tests in women, following its introduction in 1998.

CONCLUSIONS
Women, especially vulnerable groups, account for a growing number and proportion of newly diagnosed HIV infections in Alberta.
The implications of expanded screening in this population merit further consideration.


RESULTS
All search patterns noticeably peaked in January 2011.


RESULTS
Children aged 2 to 9 years were the most frequently injured (59.3/100,000 CHIRPP cases), and fractures accounted for 34.5% of all injuries.


RESULTS
Areas west of the river are some of the most deprived areas in the city.
Saskatoon's mean food balance ratio of 2.3 indicates that access favours fast food.

CONCLUSION
This study highlights the importance of contextual studies of food access.


INTRODUCTION
Venous leg ulceration is associated with pain and poor health-related quality of life (HRQL).

RESULTS
Mean age was 66.5 years; 47% were male.
Median NPS score was 2.2 (out of 10) and mean PCS and MCS scores were 38.0 and 50.5, respectively (scores are standardized to a mean of 50 representing average HRQL).
Younger age, living with others, and arthritis were associated with pain.


RESULTS
Outdoor play and sports equipment appear to be associated with the greatest numbers of injuries.


RESULTS
A response rate of 23% was obtained.
The majority of the respondents (90%) reported using the Diversified technique on pregnant patients, followed by soft tissue therapy (62%) and Activator (42%).
Most of the respondents (92%) indicated that they prescribe stretching exercises to pregnant patients and recommend a multivitamin (84%) or folic acid (81%) to pregnant patients.

CONCLUSION
Most respondents indicated prescribing exercise, and making adjunctive and nutritional recommendations frequently for their pregnant patients.


RESULTS
For the entire participant pool, ICC [2,1] = 0.61, judged "good."
Stratification by examiner confidence levels resulted in small subgroups with equivocal results.


OBJECTIVE
In Part 1 of this study (published previously), the demographics and practice patterns of the respondents were presented.

RESULTS
There were 108 respondents to the survey, giving a response rate of 22.4%.
By comparison, respondents utilized the same therapeutic procedures for patients care less consistently.


METHODS
This randomized, prospective validation study took place between January and May 2011 in the ICUs of 4 hospitals: 2 community-level ICUs and 2 tertiary referral ICUs.
The 6 pharmacy residents were randomly assigned to assess patients admitted to the ICU using FASTHUG-MAIDENS or standard monitoring practice.


METHODS
The physical compatibility and stability of admixtures of morphine 1000 μg/mL and naloxone 4 μg/mL, 12.5 μg/mL, and 25 μg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride were studied.
For each concentration of naloxone, one bag was stored at room temperature (22°C) for 72 h and one bag was stored under refrigeration (4°C) for 30 days.
For all preparations, physical characteristics, including pH, colour, and formation of precipitate, were evaluated.
The samples were also analyzed by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic method.
Stability was defined as the retention of at least 90% of the initial concentration.

RESULTS
All preparations maintained more than 90% of the initial concentrations of morphine and naloxone at the end of the respective study periods.
The calculated lower limit of the 95% confidence interval also indicated that 90% or more of the initial concentration remained at the end of each study period.


RESULTS
From June 2010 to July 2011, a total of 1028 former inpatients were screened, of whom 399 completed the telephone survey.
More than half of the respondents were women (225 [56.4%]), and the mean age was 67 years.
Overall, 184 patients (46.1%) recalled speaking with a pharmacist during their recent admission.
Of these, 164 (89.1%) were "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with these interactions.
In addition, 332 respondents (83.2%) indicated that if the hospital offered the opportunity to talk with a pharmacist who could help answer their questions about medications, they would take advantage of this service.
The electronic hospital records of 181 patients (from 15 units at 3 sites) were analyzed to seek evidence of pharmacists' interventions or encounters (e.g., medication history, consultation).
Pharmacist documentation was found in the health records of 166 (91.7%) of all patients in this sample.


METHODS
A convenience sample of 1016 patients receiving HIV treatment in seven clinics was enrolled during 2012.
Contingent valuation was used to assess willingness to pay.
Interviewers reviewed adverse consequences of injection drug use and the benefits of MMT.
Willingness to pay was assessed using double-bounded binary questions and a follow-up open-ended question.
Point and interval data models were used to estimate maximum willingness to pay.

FINDINGS
Fifty per cent of drug users were willing to pay 50% of MMT costs.


METHODS
Data included in the database of the World Health Organization are derived from official country documents and are published annually after review by each country.
In addition to such data, the authors extracted data from publicly available web sites.

CONCLUSION
Using the wrong source can lead to erroneous conclusions.


FINDINGS
cART coverage increased significantly, from 22% of deliveries in 2008 to 61% of those in 2010.
The overall MTCT rate was 4.1% (95% CI: 3.4-4.9); 42% (49/116) of the transmissions were from the 8% (n = 238) of women without antenatal ART.
Compared with AZTm, cART was associated with a 70% greater reduction in the risk of MTCT (adjusted odds ratio: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.16-0.56).


METHODS
The authors systematically searched 9 major databases for published and unpublished sources and established direct contact with the authors of source materials.
Searches were country-specific.
To be included, studies had to report on the incidence of CT, on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgM in infants and pregnant women (including seroconversion results) or on positivity to Toxoplasma-specific IgG in the general population.
Various modelling techniques were used, depending on the country-specific data available, to estimate the CT incidence and burden in each country.

FINDINGS
The global annual incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis was estimated to be 190,100 cases (95% credible interval, CI: 179,300-206,300).


METHODS
The results from use of this simple yet powerful method are consistent with those predicted by using previously validated SimSmoke models.

FINDINGS
In total, 41 countries adopted at least one highest-level MPOWER policy between 2007 and 2010.


METHODS
A search was conducted for all country surveys reporting data on health expenditure and total household expenditure.
Data on total expenditure and health expenditure were extracted from the surveys to generate the health expenditure share (i.e. fraction of the household expenditure devoted to health).
To do this the authors relied on survey microdata or survey reports to calculate the health expenditure share for the particular instrument involved.
Health expenditure share was modelled as a function of the survey's recall period, the number of health expenditure items, the number of total expenditure items, the data collection method and the placement of the health module within the survey.
Data exists across space and time, so fixed effects for territory and year were included as well.
The model was estimated by means of ordinary least squares regression with clustered standard errors.


FINDINGS
Between 1998 and 2008, rates of mortality from respiratory disease gradually decreased in all age groups in most of the study areas.


APPROACH
Programme staff members were taught how to correctly store salt and monitor its iodine content.
Field monitors assessed the iodine content of the salt in the common kitchens of participating schools and anganwadi centres monthly.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Most of the kitchens visited in 2010 (79%) and 2011 (83%) were consistently using adequately iodized salt to prepare hot meals.


METHODS
The primary outcome was quality of the surgical specimen, assessed by the number of harvested lymph nodes (LNs) and margin status.
Data were analyzed as intention to treat.


METHODS
The main outcomes examined were 5-year local recurrence (LR) and disease-specific survival (DSS).
We also compared our results to those of the previous study from our region.


METHODS
Simulator fidelity questionnaires were developed.


FINDINGS
The pollutants identified were microbial organisms, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead and zinc.
All were detected in the catchments but only cadmium, cobalt, chromium, manganese and lead exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guideline values after water treatment.
Post-treatment contamination was observed.
For each metal, the disease burden exceeded the reference level and was comparable with that due to microbial contamination reported elsewhere in Africa.


METHODS
A cross-sectional mortuary-based study was conducted in a national sample of 38 medicolegal laboratories operating in 2009.
These were sampled in inverse proportion to the number that were operational in each of three strata defined by autopsy volume: < 500, 500-1499 or > 1499 annual autopsies.
Child homicide data were collected from mortuary files, autopsy reports and police interviews.
Cause of death, evidence of abuse and neglect or of sexual assault, perpetrator characteristics and circumstances surrounding the death were investigated.

FINDINGS
Child abuse and neglect had preceded nearly half (44.5%) of all homicides, but three times more often among girls than among boys.


FINDINGS
Overall, 9624 records of adverse events attributed to traditional medical practices - including 522 linked to herbal treatments - were identified.
Liver problems were the most frequently reported adverse events.
Only eight of the adverse events were recorded by the pharmacovigilance system run by the Food and Drug Administration.
Of the 9624 events, 1389 - mostly infections, cases of pneumothorax and burns - were linked to physical therapy (n = 285) or acupuncture/moxibustion (n = 1104).

CONCLUSION
The Consumer Agency and the Association of Traditional Korean Medicine should be included in the national pharmacovigilance system.


FINDINGS
In subgroup analyses, admissions for respiratory and infectious diseases increased during extreme heat and cold, but cardiovascular disease admissions increased only during cold temperatures.
For every increase of 1 °C above 29 °C, admissions for unintentional injuries increased by 1.9%.
Admission patterns were not sensitive to sex.
In people aged 75 years or older, admissions for infectious diseases rose during both temperature extremes.

CONCLUSION
In Hong Kong SAR, hospitalizations rise during extreme temperatures.


METHODS
Delivery costs were expressed in 2009 United States dollars (US$).
Exclusively project-related expenses and the cost of the vaccine were excluded.

FINDINGS
The economic delivery cost per vaccine dose ranged from US$ 1.44 for integrated outreach in Uganda to US$ 3.88 for school-based delivery in Peru.
In Viet Nam, the lowest cost per dose was US$ 1.92 for health-centre-based delivery.
The delivery cost of HPV vaccine was higher than published costs for traditional vaccines recommended by the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).


RELEVANT CHANGES
In 2010, 13.5% of registered infants could not be breastfed.
These infants received ready-to-use infant formula.


METHODS
Inpatient records of admissions between January 1, 2004, and March 31, 2007, were analyzed to identify the presence of clinical pharmacy notes (CPNs).
The characteristics of patients with and without CPNs were compared using descriptive statistics.
For primary analysis of the association between patient complexity level and presence of CPNs, logistic regression modelling was performed to adjust for potential confounding.
Logistic regression was also used to explore the possible association between CPNs and mortality.

RESULTS
The main study cohort comprised 1561 patients: 333 (21.3%) with CPNs and 1228 (78.7%) with no CPNs.
A greater proportion of those with a CPN had the highest complexity level: 295 (88.6%) of those with CPNs versus 660 (53.7%) of those with no CPNs.
After adjustment for age and sex, the odds ratio for having a CPN among patients with complexity level 4 (relative to patients with lower complexity levels) was 8.20 (95% confidence interval 5.44-12.38).
Mortality rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups: 26.7% (89/333) among patients with CPNs and 27.9% (343/1228) among those without CPNs (p = 0.66).
After adjustment for age, sex, complexity level, and length of stay in the ICU, the presence of a CPN was not significantly associated with mortality.
Mortality rates in the matched cohort (n = 1078) were also similar between patients with and without CPNs (89/333 [26.7%] and 226/745 [30.3%], respectively; p = 0.23), and the presence of a CPN was not significantly associated with mortality after adjustments for potential confounding factors.


METHODS
Literature and Internet searches were performed to identify pictograms and pictogram categories.
A call for pictograms was also circulated through the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP).
Elements appearing in at least 50% of these preferred pictograms were highlighted as key graphic elements for design of future pictograms.

RESULTS
In total, 21 categories were identified for pictograms used in clinical practice, and a total of 204 pictograms were analyzed.


METHODS
This pilot study was a retrospective, cross-sectional chart analysis.
The health records database for Alberta Health Services was searched to identify patients with diabetes who underwent vascular surgery at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary with discharge between January 1 and June 30, 2010.
In addition to baseline demographic characteristics, blood pressure values at the time of admission and discharge were collected.
Descriptive analysis of the data was performed.

RESULTS
Just over half of the patients (23 [55%]) had achieved target blood pressure (< 130/80 mm Hg) at the time of discharge.


RESULTS
A total of 74 pharmacists consented to participate, 38 randomly assigned to use the enhanced online module and 36 to attend the face-to-face learning session.
Insufficient data were available to analyze the secondary outcome of knowledge retention over time.
Participant satisfaction was similar for the 2 groups (p = 0.62).


RESULTS
Scales from the two measures were complementary in defining higher-order traits.


OBJECTIVE
The current study examined the reliability and validity of BPD in a large sample of adolescent psychiatric patients.

RESULTS
Consistent with previous studies in adolescent clinical samples, approximately 30% of patients in the current sample met criteria for BPD.
The nine BPD criteria demonstrated good internal consistency, equivalent to rates reported in adult samples.
Notably, reliability and validity remained satisfactory even when analyses were limited to younger adolescents between the ages of 12 and 14.


RESULTS
The findings indicate that childhood neglect is a significant predictor of an increase in BPD symptoms, while childhood abuse is a significant predictor of an increase in ASPD symptoms.
Moreover, abuse and neglect acted as moderators of the relationship between temperament dimensions and increase in BPD and ASPD symptoms, respectively.
Abuse was associated with an increase in BPD symptoms for children with low Affiliation, while neglect was associated with an increase in ASPD symptoms for children with low Effortful Control.


METHODS
Relevant articles were reviewed for inclusion.

RESULTS
Several specialized treatments have been studied with mixed results.
Pharmacotherapy has no evidence supporting its use in this population.


CONCLUSIONS
First line prescription of antidepressants for youth is not advisable.
The black box and international warnings on pediatric use of antidepressants are warranted.


RESULTS
For women the gradient was less steep: 1.23, 1.24, 1.32 and 1.53.
This gradient was present for most causes of death.

CONCLUSION
Mortality gradients by occupational skill level were evident for most causes of death.


INTRODUCTION
Injuries are a leading cause of death and morbidity.

RESULTS
Falls were the most frequent cause of injury.


RESULTS
While the number of fall-related deaths increased between 1981 and 2009, the adjusted falls-related mortality rate remained relatively stable.
Since the early 2000s, this stability has masked opposing trends.


RESULTS
The issue of multiple comparisons is the most likely explanation for this finding.
Cox models revealed that female lung cancer was significantly higher in Pickering versus north Oshawa (HR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.23-4.46) and that tritium was not associated with increased risk.
The improved methodology used in this study adds to our understanding of cancer risks associated with low-dose tritium exposure.


CONCLUSION
Overall, the 2009 SLCDC-H represents its source population and provides novel, comprehensive data on the diagnosis and management of hypertension.
The survey has been adapted to other chronic conditions--diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological conditions.


RESULTS
The lack of concordance also differs according to whether the individual was First Nation, Métis or Inuit.


RESULTS
Nociceptive and neuropathic pain categories are each divided into 4 subcategories.


RESULTS
The response rate was 43%.
Over 90% of all students reported they had been vaccinated.


CONCLUSIONS
Further higher quality research is indicated.


RESULTS
The survey response rate was 34% (120 responses), of which 75% of respondents currently had a reconstructive practice and 25% had a cosmetic practice.

CONCLUSIONS
The field of reconstructive plastic surgery appears to be thriving in Canada.
Differences between reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgeons are discussed.


RESULTS
All repairs were successful, with no complications and no patients requiring secondary procedures.
All patients regained normal feeding function three weeks postoperatively.

CONCLUSIONS
Using this technique, good speech and feeding function with no complications were achieved.


RESULTS
Three patients in group 1 (9.1%) receiving fibrin sealant developed seroma.


RESULTS
Of the 1759 articles reviewed, 726 (41%) were included.

CONCLUSION
In the plastic surgery journals reviewed, the lack of documentation of disclosures was frequent.


RESULTS
During the study period, 10 unique Enterobacteriaceae isolates expressing KPC were detected from nine ICU patients.
Five patients had infections (three pneumonias, one surgical site infection, one urinary tract infection).
Isolates included Escherichia coli (5), Klebsiella oxytoca (2), Serratia marcescens (2) and Citrobacter freundii (1).

CONCLUSIONS
The KPC gene can spread via plasmids to different genera of the Enterobacteriaceae family.
The dissemination of KPC in Enterobacteriaceae and the consequences for treatment and infection control measures warrant a high degree of vigilance among clinicians and microbiologists.


CONCLUSIONS
Most participants chose not to admit or treat the patient in the baseline vignette.
A large range of response scores was likely due to differing regional practices or to different levels of experience.


RESULTS
Most ET-15 isolates expressed the antigenic formula of C:2a:P1.7,1 or C:2a:P1.5.


RESULTS
2.1% and 1.1% of E coli harboured aac(6')Ib-cr and qnrB, respectively.


INTRODUCTION
Graves' ophthalmopathy is characterized by an increase in the volume of orbital soft tissue contents and an associated increase in intraorbital pressure.
Surgical expansion of bony orbital volume is therefore an effective method of treating moderate to severe exophthalmos.
Numerous correlations between specific decompression procedures and reduction of proptosis have been made.

RESULTS
Following surgery, mean globe retrodisplacement from the lateral orbital rim and from the optic foramen were 6.7 mm and 3.3 mm, respectively.


CONCLUSION
A greater percentage of women practise exclusive breastfeeding in countries where laws guarantee breastfeeding breaks at work.


METHODS
In 2009, the costs to health-care providers of providing comprehensive PMTCT services were assessed in 20 public health facilities in Namibia and Rwanda.
Information on prices and on the total amount of each service provided was collected at the national level.

FINDINGS
The estimated costs to the providers of PMTCT, for each mother-infant pair, were US$202.75-1029.55 in Namibia and US$94.14-342.35 in Rwanda.
These costs varied with the drug regimen employed.
At 2009 coverage levels, the maximal estimates of the national costs of PMTCT were US$3.15 million in Namibia and US$7.04 million in Rwanda (or < US$0.75 per capita in both countries).
Treatment and prophylaxis accounted for less than 20% of the costs of PMTCT in both study countries.


FINDINGS
Overall, 2381 records of trials were investigated.


METHODS
From 2004 to 2011, births and neonatal deaths in 36 geographical clusters in Jharkhand and Odisha were monitored.
Logistic regression was used to examine neonatal mortality rates after 2008 in the two zones.

FINDINGS
Data on 41,191 births were analysed.
Hygiene during delivery, thermal care of the neonate and exclusive breastfeeding were important factors.


METHODS
The study included 3180 patients with T1DM (mean age 22 years ± 11.8) who were surveyed while receiving health care from the NBHCS.

CONCLUSION
Health technologies accounted for most direct medical costs of T1DM.


METHODS
A cluster-sampled probability survey of 1593 households in the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, was conducted in 2011.

FINDINGS
The most frequently reported illnesses among children younger than 5 years and adults were common tropical infections and noncommunicable diseases, respectively.


APPROACH
This study, based on survey data, assesses the results of a registration campaign initiated in 2004-2005 in Ghana.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Unlike many other sub-Saharan African countries, Ghana saw a substantial rise in registration rates over the campaign period.
Campaign strategies improved accessibility and shortened distance to registration centres.


METHODS
We compared 373 patients who underwent BTKA with 966 who underwent UTKA between May 2008 and May 2011.


RESULTS
For interrater reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.637 to 0.915.
The overall interrater reliability for the total FIX-IT score was 0.879 (95% confidence interval 0.828-0.921).

CONCLUSION
The FIX-IT score had high interrater agreement across multiple examiners.
Moreover, FIX-IT scores correlate with the physical scores of the SF-36.
Diagnostic
Study Level I.


RESULTS
Among 60 patients with major hepatic injuries, 35 (58%) underwent resuscitation after the implementation of an MTP.
Patient and injury characteristics were similar between cohorts.
Implementation of the MTP significantly improved plasma: red blood cell:platelet ratios and decreased crystalloid fluid resuscitation (p = 0.026).
Rapid improvement in early acidosis and coagulopathy was superior with an MTP (p = 0.009).
More patients in the MTP group also underwent primary abdominal fascial closure during their hospital stay (p = 0.021).
This was most evident with grade 4 injuries (89% vs. 14%).
The mean time to fascial closure was 4.2 days.
The overall survival rate for all major liver injuries was not affected by an MTP (p = 0.61).

CONCLUSION
This occurred concurrently to a decrease in the delivered volume of crystalloid fluid.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare patients referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency with those who were not referred.
Comparison was based on age, sex and geographic location.
We used univariate and logistic regression analysis to identify significant differences between the cohorts.


RESULTS
Mean (± SD) total screen time was 4.5±2.4 h/day.

CONCLUSIONS
Youth are spending many hours each day in front of screens.


RESULTS
Parents had no previous knowledge about prematurity.
They would have preferred prioritized information during predelivery counselling focused on the immediate risks to their child.
Resuscitation wishes were inconsistently sought.
Opportunities for repeat discussions involving both parents were often missed.
Additional materials, such as pamphlets or videos, would improve counselling.

CONCLUSIONS
Once the decision is made to resuscitate, parents want the neonatal team to convey a message of hope and compassion.


RESULTS
Two hundred eighty HCPs answered the questionnaire (90% response rate).


INTRODUCTION
Several agents can be administered during procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in the emergency department (ED).

RESULTS
A total of 55 physicians completed the survey.
The most frequently used drugs were fentanyl (66.0% often or always) and propofol with fentanyl (59.2% often or always).
Most respondents stated that they rarely used ketofol (54.2% rarely or never) or etomidate (77.1% rarely or never).
Respondents were most comfortable using midazolam or fentanyl (96.1% somewhat or very comfortable), and least comfortable administering etomidate and ketofol (36.5% and 23.1% somewhat or very uncomfortable).
These differences were magnified with comparison of physicians with CCFP (Certification in The College of Family Physicians) and CCFP(EM) (emergency medicine) designations.
Additionally, etomidate's adverse effects were the least astutely recognized (19%), compared with midazolam combined with fentanyl (63%).


METHODS
Projections of trends in mortality, by cause, at older ages were also made.

FINDINGS
In both developed and developing countries, the leading causes of death among older women were cardiovascular diseases and cancers.


METHODS
Information from the PAHO Country Capacity Survey on noncommunicable diseases was also analysed.

FINDINGS
The Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and Uruguay showed relatively high rates of death from breast cancer, whereas the three highest rates of death from cervical cancer were observed in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Paraguay.
Several countries - particularly Paraguay and Venezuela - have high rates of death from both types of cancer.


METHODS
The mean number of risk factors per woman was estimated.
Their independent demographic and socioeconomic covariates were also examined with ordinal logistic regression.

FINDINGS
The mean number of risk factors per woman was 1.61; 48.0% of the women had at least two risk factors.


METHODS
The Short Form (36) Health Survey was used to measure physical functioning (score 1-100).
The disability threshold was the mean physical functioning score in older women requiring assistance with daily activities (62.8).
The relationship between age and physical functioning was modelled using spline regression for the entire sample, and by baseline physical functioning quintile and physical activity level.


METHODS
A random-effects model was then used to calculate and compare the odds of men and women having each condition.


PROBLEM
To redress this situation, health systems must be strengthened.


RELEVANT CHANGES
In 2011-2012, Rwanda vaccinated 227,246 girls with all three doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.
Among eligible girls, three-dose coverage rates of 93.2% and 96.6% were achieved in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

LESSONS LEARNT
This requires political will, cross-sectoral collaboration and planning, innovative partnerships and robust monitoring and evaluation.


METHODS
Data on CHE, outpatient and inpatient OOP payments and other expenditure from all major national or multi-state surveys since 2000 were compared.
All but the NSS 2004-05 and the NSS 2009-10 used different questionnaires.


METHODS
In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, two strategies for neonatal care--known as home care and community care--were compared with existing services.
Neonatal mortality in each study arm was determined through household surveys.
The incremental cost-effectiveness of each strategy--compared with that of the pre-existing levels of maternal and neonatal care--was then estimated.
The levels of uncertainty in our estimates were quantified through probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

FINDINGS
The corresponding total societal costs were US$ 2971 (95% CI: 1844-7628) and US$ 104.62 (95% CI: 65.15-266.60), respectively.
In contrast, implementation of the community-care strategy led to no reduction in neonatal mortality and did not appear to be cost-effective.


FINDINGS
Twelve low- and middle-income countries have DRG-based payment systems and another 17 are in the piloting or exploratory stage.
All countries have set expenditure ceilings.
In general, systems were piloted before being implemented.
The need to meet certain requirements in terms of coding standardization, data availability and information technology made implementation difficult.
Private sector providers have not been fully integrated, but most countries have managed to delink hospital financing from public finance budgeting.


METHODS
A case-control study was conducted with surveillance data from Matlab, a rural subdistrict.

FINDINGS
The fraction of ever-smokers was about 84% among cases and 73% among controls (OR: 1.7; 99% confidence interval, CI: 1.1-2.5).
ORs were highest for cancers and lower for respiratory, vascular and other diseases.
A dose-response relationship was noted between age at smoking initiation and daily number of cigarettes or bidis smoked and the risk of death.
In 2010, about 25% of all deaths observed in Bangladeshi men aged 25 to 69 years (i.e. 42,000 deaths) were attributable to smoking.


FINDINGS
A higher level of perceived social support was associated with milder symptoms of PTSD.
Women, older people and those with a formal education were more often and more severely affected by PTSD.


METHODS
Five electronic databases were searched for relevant abstracts and to identify papers eligible for full-text review.
References of papers included in our study were searched to identify additional candidate publications.
Disagreements about inclusion were adjudicated during discussions involving all authors.
Data were extracted independently by two authors, using a form developed by the authors and tested on a sample of papers.

FINDINGS
A total of 2320 unique papers was found; the full text of 87 was reviewed.
Nineteen papers featuring 11 cross-sectional studies were included; all were published during 1995-2011.
The prevalence of dementia ranged from 0%, in Nigeria, to 10.1% (95% confidence interval, CI: 8.6-11.8), also in Nigeria.


RESULTS
The major group of perforators supplying the overlying skin was from the intercostal vessels.


RESULTS
The dorsum of the proximal phalanx, however, was unpredictably included in the anesthetized territory.


RESULTS
A diagnosis of benign eccrine acrospiroma was made after histopathological examination.
There was no recurrence five months after the operation.

CONCLUSION
Although eccrine acrospiromas are usually benign, they can, on rare occasions, undergo malignant transformation.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The number of breast reconstruction procedures increased 15 fold during the study period.
Health sector employees must evaluate these trends to determine if the breast reconstructive services currently offered in this region are adequate.
Place of residency (urban versus rural) seems to play a role in women's decisions to proceed with breast reconstruction.


CONCLUSION
In our 'cosmetic society', the inferior blepharoplasty through a transconjunctival approach has taken a significant place in the armamentarium of the esthetic surgeon.
Juvenile palpebral lipoptosis without skin excess constitutes the best indication for this technique.
It is also indicated in secondary blepharoplasty and in patients presenting with a cicatricial risk or with orbital septum distention.


RESULTS
The Doppler detected inadequate blood flow in nine free flaps.
In five of the cases, the cause was a kink in the vein.
In the sixth case, compression of the vein after insetting was detected and successfully corrected.


RESULTS
Vein grafts were required in 9.6% of free flaps.
The most common indication was vein graft use in a planned preoperative fashion.
The vein graft was most commony placed as an arteriovenous fistula loop.
There was no statistically significant difference in survival between flaps with or without vein grafts.


OBJECTIVE
Seven patients with severe high-voltage electrical burns are presented.
The application and timing of microvascular free-flap coverage is discussed.


RESULTS
Indirect costs were four to nine times higher than direct costs in both techniques.


METHODS
A cross-sectional survey of hospital pharmacists was conducted in Alberta, Canada.
An invitation to participate was sent to all 766 hospital pharmacists practising in the province's 2 health service organizations.

RESULTS
Of the 347 pharmacists who completed the survey (45% response rate), the majority (297 [86%]) were staff pharmacists working full time in an urban setting.
The average age of respondents was 41 years (standard deviation [SD] 11 years), and the average period in practice was 17 years (SD 11 years).


RESULTS
Atrial fibrillation was paroxysmal in 82 (44%) of the patients, persistent in 47 patients (25%), and permanent in 58 (31%).
One patient in each of the 3 cohorts had experienced a stroke during the 6 months before study participation.
Bleeding events were more frequent among patients who had discontinued VKA therapy than in the other 2 groups.
The most common reason for not initiating VKA therapy in treatment-naive patients was the transient nature of atrial fibrillation (25/62 [40%]).
The most common reason for discontinuation of VKA therapy was a bleeding event (10/42 [24%]).

CONCLUSIONS
VKA therapy was not initiated or was discontinued for various reasons.


RESULTS
A total of 539 injuries were reported during the 2007/2008 school year.
The head, neck or face were most commonly injured.
Injury rates per 1000 student days ranged between 0.018 (rubber crumb in spring) and 0.08 (poured-in-place and natural rock in the fall).


RESULTS
Two studies were reviewed; however, neither of the studies reported on the outcome of sepsis.


RESULTS
Physiological conditions represented 22.5% of referrals.
The type of referring physician did not determine referral quality.


RESULTS
Reconstruction was effective in both cases.


CONCLUSION
The present health management in the United States requires new solutions.


CONCLUSIONS
However, after 15 years, the microvascular flaps regained the ability to sweat and some degree of thermoregulatory function.


RESULTS
Ninety-two percent of participants indicated that recruitment of child psychiatrists in Canada is a problem.
Other deterrents included lower salary than other subspecialties, lack of exposure during training, stigma, and lack of interest in treating children.

CONCLUSIONS
A rebranding of the role and perception of psychiatry is needed to attract future psychiatrists.


RESULTS
In phase 1, 28 stakeholders from six sectors participated in the consultation group and provided input on multiple aspects of the proposal.
Through this process, 19 stakeholders adopted formal roles within the project.
In phase 2, 206 surveys were received (response rate = 62%).
Survey responses supported the grant focus (concurrent youth mental health and substance use problems).
Respondents also prioritized project goals and provided specific feedback on research and knowledge translation.
Finally, although some stakeholders chose greater involvement, most survey respondents indicated a preference for a moderate level of participation in research rather than full team membership.


RESULTS
The immigrant group more frequently reported barriers and delays in accessing mental health services.
They often reported lack of primary care physicians and language barriers.
They were less likely to have a biomedical perspective or to use specialized resources for their children prior to admission.
Both groups reported apprehension about medication trials, though the immigrant parents were less likely to agree to psychopharmacological treatment.
None of the professionals treating parents for mental health problems initiated referral of their impaired children.


CONCLUSION
This qualitative study suggests that the day-to-day experiences of adolescents with borderline personality disorder is centred on the experience of the present.
Discontinuity in self-image, alongside marked dysphoric manifestations, leads to distress and hinders compliance with care.


RESULTS
Significantly high proportion of mothers (89%) had anxiety, depression, or both anxiety and depression together as compared to fathers (77%) (p-value <0.05).
Among mothers, 35% met criteria for anxiety, 40% for depression and 13% for both anxiety and depression.
Among fathers 42% had anxiety, 31% depression and 3% both anxiety and depression.
There was a significant association between gender of parent and individual psychiatric diagnosis of anxiety, depression and anxiety and depression together (p-value <0.05).
A significant association was also found between mother's anxiety, depression or both and degree of ID of their children (p-value <0.05).


CONCLUSION
Age of the child and severity of symptoms did not significantly affect medication adherence.


RESULTS
No organic etiology was detected.

CONCLUSION
Mania is a difficult diagnosis in youths due to its nonspecific symptoms, rare prepubertal occurrence, and diagnostic complexity.


RESULTS
Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria for the present systematic review.

CONCLUSIONS
Although RTW ideally reflects function and recovery, it is inadequately measured and reported.


RESULTS
Demographic, collision and injury data were collected from these charts and statistically analyzed.
The general demographic features of the two groups were similar.
The overall injury severity was similar in both groups.


RESULTS
We studied 53 patients.

CONCLUSION
However, certain constellation of symptoms are much more indicative of etiology.


RESULTS
Twenty patients were treated with CRPP and 24 with VLP.
There were no significant differences in patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) scores between the 2 groups at any time point (mean 16.2 ± 23.1 in the CRPP group v. 21.5 ± 23.6 in the VLP group, p = 0.91).
The mean duration of surgery was longer for VLP than CRPP (113.9 ± 39.5 min v. 86.5 ± 7.8 min, p = 0.029), but there were fewer clinic visits (5.2 ± 1.4 v. 7.8 ± 1.3, p < 0.001) and fewer radiographs (7.4 ± 2.7 v. 9 ± 2.4, p = 0.031).
The total cost per case was greater for VLP than CRPP ($1637.27 v. $733.91).


RESULTS
Our survey response rate was 56.2% (91 of 162).
The time from operation ranged from 1.24-7.13 (mean 3.96) years, and 87.9% of patients had undergone a physical exam within the previous year.
Only 37.4% and 14% of patients had a serum thyroglobulin measurement within 6 and between 6 and 12 months before the survey, respectively.
The TSH levels were suppressed (< 0.1 μIU/L) in 24.2% of patients, 0.1-2 μIU/L in 44% and greater than 2 μIU/L in 17.6%.
Ultrasonography was the most common imaging test performed.


METHODS
We audited ORs for open IHR at 6 academic hospitals.

RESULTS
We audited 213 ORs, and we excluded 7 femoral hernia ORs.
Tension-free repairs were the most common (82.5%), and the plug-and-patch technique was the most frequent (52.9%).
Residents dictated 59% of ORs.
Of 33 variables, 15 were considered essential and, on average, 10.8 ± 1.3 were included.
Of 18 nonessential elements, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, preoperative antibiotics and urgency were reported in 1.9%, 11.7% and 24.3% of ORs, respectively.
Repair-specific details were reported in 0 to 97.1% of ORs, including patch sutured to tubercle (55.1%) and location of plug (67.0%).


RESULTS
Left ventricular ejection fraction was 26.6% ± 3.5% in group I and 27.7% ± 4.7% in group II.
Left ventricular end diastolic diameter was 65.6 ± 3.6 mm in group I and 64.1 ± 3.2 mm in group II.
There was a significant reduction in mortality in the conventional and on-pump beating-heart groups (p < 0.001).
Perioperative myocardial infarction and low cardiac output syndrome were higher in group I than group II (both p < 0.05).
Improvement of left ventricular function after the surgical procedure was better in group II than group I.


METHODS
We reviewed the charts of all adults undergoing esophagectomy for carcinoma between January 2000 and June 2008.

RESULTS
In all, 111 patients underwent elective esophagectomy for carcinoma, and 103 had a jejunostomy tube placed.
The mean age was 67 ± 10.8 years.
The median time to oral intake was 7 (interquartile range 7-11) days.
Seventy-four (67%) patients resumed oral intake within 8 days.
The mean nutrition delivered by jejunostomy within the first 8 days as a percentage of the target was 45.6% (95% confidence interval 41.2%-49.9%).
Six (5.4%) patients experienced complications attributable solely to the jejunostomy tube; 3 (2.9%) required surgery.
Forty (38.8%) patients had abdominal issues serious enough to warrant delaying the progression of feeding.


METHODS
We used surgeon timing in a demonstration to differentiate early and late adopters of the QIRC strategy.
Surgeons completed surveys on perceptions of the strategy and personal characteristics.

RESULTS
Nineteen of 56 surgeons (34%) requested an operative demonstration on their first case of rectal surgery.
Early and late adopters had similar perceptions of the QIRC strategy and similar characteristics.


RESULTS
A total of 211 patients underwent 236 hip arthroscopies.
The mean age at time of surgery was 37 ± 13 years and mean follow-up was 394 ± 216.5 days.
The overall complication rate associated with hip arthroscopy was 4.2% (95% confidence interval 2.3%-7.6%).
We identified 4 major and 6 minor complications.

CONCLUSION
However, surgeons should recognize the possibility of serious complications associated with this procedure.


RESULTS
The QIRC trial enrolled 1015 patients at 16 hospitals between 2002 and 2004.
Radiation therapy use did not differ between trial arms, and median follow-up was 3.6 years.
For the preoperative, postoperative and no RT groups, respectively, the percentage of patients was 12.8%, 19.3% and 67.9%; the percentage of stage II/III tumours was 57.0%, 88.7% and 48.1%; and the local recurrence rate was 5.3%, 10.2% and 5.5% (p = 0.05).

CONCLUSION
Our results suggest opportunities to improve rectal cancer RT use in Ontario.


RESULTS
Among 60 severely injured patients (mean ISS 31, hypotension 18%, mortality 12%), the median time interval to the initiation of an angiographic procedure was 270 minutes.
Of the procedures performed, 85% were therapeutic embolizations and 15% were diagnostic procedures.
Splenic (median time 243 min, range 32-801 min) and pelvic (median time 278 min, range 153-466 min) embolizations accounted for 43% and 25% of procedures, respectively.
Nearly 22% of patients required both an emergent percutaneous and subsequent operative procedure.
Percutaneous therapy typically preceded open operative explorations.


METHODS
We analyzed the outcomes of all patients with NSCLC undergoing surgical resection at the Cancer Centre of Southeastern Ontario between 1998 and 2009.
The standard of care for patients with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve was lobectomy.
Wedge resection was performed for patients with inadequate reserve to tolerate lobectomy.
Predictors of recurrence and survival were assessed.

RESULTS
A total of 423 patients underwent surgical resection during our study period: wedge resection in 71 patients and lobectomy in 352.
The mean age of patients was 64 years.
Mean follow-up for cancer survivors was 39 months.


RESULTS
Aggregate plastic surgery wait times at the 90th percentile failed to meet targets based on priority.
For priority 2 (target = 28 days) and priority 3 cases (target = 84 days), wait times were 35 and 101 days, respectively (P<0.05).
Wait times also consistently exceeded provincial standards in the southwestern (Local Health Integration Network [LHIN] 2), eastern (LHINs 10 and 11) and northeastern (LHIN 13) regions of Ontario.
In contrast, a positive correlation was observed for priority 2 (r=0.50; P<0.05) and priority 3 cases (r=0.35; P<0.05).

CONCLUSION
Plastic surgery wait times in Ontario exceeded benchmarks in several geographical regions.
Paradoxically, for high-priority cases, wait times were longer in LHINs with a higher density of plastic surgeons.


RESULTS
Of 152 cases treated during the study period, there were five (two children and three adults) with comminution.
Two patterns of comminution were encountered: splitting and fragmentation of the phalangeal head.
The complication occurred during open reduction and K-wire fixation, or during closed reduction in the emergency room.
The outcome was generally poor and worse in patients with fragmentation of the entire head.
Two of the five cases ultimately resulted in medicolegal claims.


RESULTS
The postoperative mean vaginal length was 8.4 cm (range 6 cm to 11 cm) in 19 patients who used the mould regularly.


RESULTS
There were no postoperative complications or extension lag of the donor finger.


RESULTS
The majority (67.7%) of the 31 participants reported no concern.


RESULTS
Finally, the participants asserted that current methods to assess residents on their performance as collaborators are suboptimal.

CONCLUSIONS
The Collaborator role should be a formal part of the residency curriculum.


RESULTS
Twenty-five episodes of S maltophilia BSI (0.9% of all BSIs) involving 24 patients were identified between 1999 and 2009.
The rate of S maltophilia BSIs per 1000 admissions ranged from 0.04 to 0.22 (average 0.09).
Greater than one-half of the episodes (13 of 25 [52%]) were admitted to the intensive care unit before BSI onset.
Resistance to TMP/SMX occurred in 8.3% of all infections.
Fifteen per cent of isolates were resistant to ticarcillin/clavulanate.
Mortality attributed to bacteremia was 16.7%.


RESULTS
A total of 2108 patients were studied.
Twenty-six per cent of patients were admitted on a weekend.
The overall in-hospital case fatality rate was 13%.
After-hours sampling was not associated with mortality in a multivariable logistic regression model examining factors associated with death.


RESULTS
Six confirmed positive cultures (Aspergillus fumigatus [two cases], Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria infectoria and Rhizomucor pusillus) met the criteria for breakthrough filamentous mold infection while on caspofungin therapy.
Underlying immunocompromising conditions included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two cases), acute myeloid leukemia (two cases), Burkitt's lymphoma and aplastic anemia.
All patients received a lipid amphotericin B product as part of their treatment for breakthrough infection.
Five patients also received voriconazole and one received posaconazole.


RESULTS
A total of 200 patients tested with QFT were included in the analysis.
LTBI investigation and QFT testing were considered to be appropriate in 87.5% and 66.5% of patients, respectively.


RESULTS
Total treatment costs were $3,850 for linezolid versus $5,189 for vancomycin.
were sensitive to the number of treatment days spent at home and the discharge rate.


RESULTS
All 158 isolates were penicillin G sensitive.
Constitutive MLSB resistance was observed in 12.7% of isolates.


RESULTS
Two of the 75 children with pH1N1 died versus no deaths in children with seasonal influenza.
None of the children had received pH1N1, seasonal influenza, conjugated pneumococal or Haemophilus influenzae b vaccines.


RESULTS
Of the 598 patients enrolled, 573 developed suspected bloodstream infection and 434 (72.6%) had blood cultures sent 24 h after ICU admission; 142 were excluded due to positive cultures from other sites.
Of the remaining 292 patients, 31 (10.7%) grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 59 (20.2%) grew known pathogenic organisms and 202 (69.2%) did not grow any organisms in their blood cultures.
Twenty-five patients without suspicion of infection served as the control group.
In the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus group, patients who died by day 28 had increased inflammatory bio-marker levels compared with survivors, although the differences were not statistically significant.


RESULTS
The mortality rate and the severity of NEC were not significantly different between the RV+ and RV- groups.


RESULTS
APHAs were more likely to be female and have lower income, education and employment.


OBJECTIVE
Patellar tendinopathy affects a substantial proportion of athletes involved in jumping or kicking activities.

CLINICAL FEATURES
Patellar tendinopathy is often the result of repetitive or excessive overload on the patellar tendon.


CONCLUSIONS
Ganglion cysts of the foot are relatively rare connective tissue tumours with variable treatment approaches.
Electroacupuncture may be a novel and non-invasive conservative approach for the treatment of ganglion cysts.
Further evaluation of the efficacy of such treatment is warranted.


CLINICAL FEATURES
Two cases of chronic knee pain that were unresponsive to previous treatment.


RESULTS
Ten articles met the inclusion criteria.

CONCLUSION
However, there is no evidence to show that kinesiotape has a negative effect on any of the performace measures.


METHODS
Such data are presented in this paper, by World Bank country income groups, in millions of national currency units per calendar year for salaried and non-salaried health workers.
They are presented as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), total health expenditure and general government health expenditure.
The average yearly change in remuneration (i.e. compound annual growth rate) between 2000 and 2012 as a function of these parameters was also assessed.

FINDINGS
Remuneration of health workers, on the other hand, has grown faster than that of other types of workers.


FINDINGS
A national authority was designated by 85 countries.
Only 56 countries reported on the status of Code implementation.
In 90% of countries, migrant health professionals reportedly enjoy the same legal rights and responsibilities as domestically trained health personnel.
In the context of the Code, cooperation in the area of health workforce development goes beyond migration-related issues.


FINDINGS
Fifty-three studies, mostly from high-income countries and conducted at tertiary care facilities, were identified.
In general, there was no difference between the effectiveness of care provided by mid-level health workers in the areas of maternal and child health and communicable and noncommunicable diseases and that provided by higher level health workers.
Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low.

CONCLUSION
However, the quality of the evidence was low.


LESSONS LEARNT
In the improvement of HRH, strong leadership is needed to ensure effective coordination and communication between the many different stakeholders.
A national process of coordination and facilitation can produce a consensus-based view of the main HRH challenges.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data were extracted from the results of 80 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 26 countries in southern Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.
The annual rates recorded for each country were then compared to see if they had increased over time.

FINDINGS
Caesarean delivery rates had risen over time in all but 6 study countries but were consistently found to be lower than 5% in 18 of the countries and 10% or less in the other eight countries.
Among the poorest 20% of the population, caesarean sections accounted for less than 1% and less than 2% of deliveries in 12 and 21 of the study countries, respectively.
In each of 11 countries, the caesarean delivery rate in the poorest 40% of the population remained under 1%.
In Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Niger and Nigeria, the rate remained under 1% in the poorest 80%.
However, the rates recorded among the poorest quintile in each of these countries consistently fell below 2%.


FINDINGS
The results highlight important gaps in service delivery that are obstacles to universal access to health services.


METHODS
A public health evaluation framework was used to assess gaps in a child contact management programme at a lung clinic.
Targets for programme performance indicators were derived from established programme indicator targets, the scientific literature and expert opinion.
Compliance with tuberculosis screening, the initiation of isoniazid preventive therapy in children younger than 5 years, the accuracy of tuberculosis diagnosis and adherence to preventive therapy were assessed in 755 child contacts in two cohorts.
The cost to caregivers was recorded.


FINDINGS
Before the intervention, the hospitalization rate in the rural population was significantly lower than in the comparison group.
The monthly increase in the hospitalization rate continued for over a year and stabilized thereafter.
No increase in the hospitalization rate was observed in the comparison group.

CONCLUSION
It has not reduced hospitalizations or hospitalization-related expenditure.


PROBLEM
A strategy was needed to determine whether the immunization targets set for the campaign were achieved.

LESSONS LEARNT
Rapid monitoring was only marginally beneficial in achieving immunization targets in the temporary camps in Port-au-Prince.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Local production of one of the WHO formulations was feasible in every participating site.
Twenty-one (54%) of the sites had replaced a previously used ABH with one of the WHO formulations.
In 32 sites, the WHO formulation that had been produced was well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.
The WHO formulations were found to be less expensive than marketed ABHs.
Barriers to local production included difficulty in identifying staff with adequate skills, the need for staff training, and constraints in ingredient and dispenser procurement.

LESSONS LEARNT
The WHO formulations can be easily produced locally at low cost.
They are well tolerated and accepted by health-care workers.
Potential barriers to their local production - such as their smell and problems in the procurement of ingredients and dispensers and in performing quality control - require further investigation.


METHODS
In addition to the survey responses, demographic and clinical data for both respondents and nonrespondents were collected.

RESULTS
Of the 175 patients invited to participate in the survey, 103 (58.9%) agreed to participate.
The majority of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with all of the survey items, indicating satisfaction with the program.
Respondents provided some suggestions for program improvement.


STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION
Studies of any design were eligible for inclusion.

DATA SYNTHESIS
Oral vancomycin may be preferred for more severe infections; however, the severity score warrants further study and validation.
For the treatment of second and subsequent recurrences, tapered or pulsed vancomycin regimens have been recommended in practice guidelines, despite very limited clinical evidence.
Similarly, the potential benefits of longer treatment courses of oral vancomycin for second and subsequent recurrences warrant investigation.
The potential role, including costs and benefits, of new agents such as fidaxomicin in the treatment of recurrent C. difficile infection remains to be determined.


RESULTS
None of the children with a father who was professionally employed reported suicide ideation.


RESULTS
HCPs' estimations of volumes 1 and 3 were 150.4% and 145.1%, respectively, of the actual volumes, and their estimations of volumes 2 and 4 were 81.9% and 85.8%, respectively, of the actual volumes.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Most parents believed that their child did not engage in excessive screen time.
Physicians and other health professionals should inform parents of these new guidelines and provide strategies to help their children meet targets.


FINDINGS
Percentages were especially low in Albania, Armenia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey.
Although recent trends in prevalence differed in England, Japan and the United States, treatment coverage and hypertension control improved over time, particularly in England.


FINDINGS
Of the 530 individuals who read the evidence briefs and attended dialogues, 304 (57%) and 303 (57%) completed questionnaires about the briefs and dialogues, respectively.
Respondents generally reported strong intentions to act on what they had learnt.


METHODS
The correlations between the time intervals recorded in a country and that country's expenditure on health and gross domestic product (GDP) were also evaluated using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient.


METHODS
The intervention took place in six rural districts selected by the Zambian Ministry of Health.
It involved community discussions on safe pregnancy and delivery led by trained volunteers and the provision of emergency transport.
Volunteers worked through existing government-established Safe Motherhood Action Groups.
Maternal health indicators at baseline were obtained from women in intervention (n = 1775) and control districts (n = 1630).

FINDINGS
The volunteer drop-out rate was low.
The estimated incremental cost per additional delivery involving a skilled birth attendant was around 54 United States dollars, comparable to that of other demand-side interventions in developing countries.


RESULTS
Regression analysis showed a quadratic relationship between age and slope, with the decrease in slope until the fifth decade of life being directly related to increasing age.
After this, age was not a significant contributor to slope changes.

CONCLUSIONS
With increasing age, the slope of the eyebrow decreases until the fifth decade dependent on age.
Therefore, choice of brow lift technique should be carefully selected.


RESULTS
Fifty-nine plastic surgery residents and 477 medical students participated in the online survey.
The most commonly reported driving forces for interest in a plastic surgery career in both groups were variety of career choice, complexity of the field, future lifestyle and enjoyable rotations in plastic surgery.
Despite these similarities, the proportion of medical students and residents who opted for future lifestyle and enjoyable rotations differed in a statistically significant manner (P=0.015 and P=0.029, respectively).


RESULTS
A total of 47 patients with a median age of eight years experienced 100 tendon injuries.
Zone III had the highest number of injuries (n=47), followed by zone II (n=39).
The modified Kessler technique was used in the majority of cases (n=62).
Only 22 tendons underwent an epitendinous repair.
Forty-two patients underwent postoperative hand therapy.
Two patients had a score <100%, not necessitating further surgery.
A second operation was required for five patients.
All patients in this group demonstrated 100% TAM at one year.


RESULTS
Qualitative data indicated differences with regard to side effects, efficacy and duration of effect.

CONCLUSIONS
The present retrospective study indicated that Novo-MPH ER-C is not therapeutically equivalent to OROS-MPH.


RESULTS
Most respondents could not identify Canada's age of sexual consent.

CONCLUSIONS
Sexual education currently offered in Ontario may require investigation.


RESULTS
BPD severity was associated with male sex, Apgar score and the occurrence of neonatal pneumonia.


RESULTS
Similar interactions with birth weight were not found.


RESULTS
A total of 387 adolescents completed the self-administered questionnaire.
The response rate for the study was 98%.
Only 27% of the respondents remembered being questioned by their doctor about sexuality, and 17% of the respondents had already brought up the topic of sexuality themselves with their doctor.
More than one-half (57%) of the adolescents reported they would be moderately comfortable to totally comfortable discussing sexuality with their doctor if they felt the need to.
Overall, when asked to evaluate their degree of comfort if questioned on specific questions about their sexuality, 73.8% to 99.5% believed they would be moderately to totally comfortable responding.
Nevertheless, there was a statistically significant difference between age groups, with the older age group being more comfortable than the younger age group (P<0.001).
There was no difference between the level of comfort among boys and girls answering the same questions.
Respondents believed that their treating physician should discuss sexuality with them (73.8%) and, in the majority of cases (78%), that he/she should initiate the conversation.


RESULTS
Five studies were reviewed.


RESULTS
The themes and their subthemes were used to inform a conceptual model of residents' experiences.


RESULTS
The mean (± SD) GPedsSE score was 18.6±2.6 of 25.
Total GPedsSE and NGSE scores were moderately correlated (r=0.54, P<0.005).
Exploratory factor analysis showed two components, each aligning with a scale.


RESULTS
Only 13.9% of paediatricians referred children younger than one year of age to a dentist.


RESULTS
Seven articles were reviewed.
There were no studies that opposed the clinical question.


RESULTS
Median wait times for visits triaged as CTAS 1, 2, 3 and 4 exceeded national recommendations.
Across all CTAS levels, the LOS in the ED increased during the study period, but met national benchmarks.


RESULTS
A total of 379 children enrolled at the SBHC and 127 children attended.


RESULTS
A total of 516 children were immunized by 31 PHNs pre- and postimplementation in the intervention sites.


RESULTS
A total of 71 patients were enrolled in the study.
The general QoL (PedsQL 4.0) and health-specific QoL (HRQoL-SB) scores for the population indicated an overall QoL of 66% (n=69) and 83% (n=67), respectively.
Approximately 46% (33 of 71) reported >1 episode of urinary incontinence per week.
Urinary continence was associated with a significantly higher urinary-specific QoL (PinQ; P<0.001), general QoL (PedsQL 4.0; P<0.05) and health-specific QoL (HRQoL-SB; P<0.05).
Furthermore, urinary incontinence and its effect on QoL was not influenced by the presence of a shunt, level of the lesion or manner of dysraphism.

CONCLUSION
These data suggest that QoL in patients with spina bifida is related to urinary continence.
This effect appears to be independent of the type and level of the spinal dysraphism and the presence or absence of a shunt.


CONCLUSIONS
The risk and cost of nosocomial RSV infection contributes to the overall burden of RSV.


RESULTS
The most common RVA strain types detected were G9P[8]I1 (n=19) and G1P[8]I1 (n=14), followed by G2P[4]I2 (n=4), G3P[6]I1 (n=1) and G4P[8]I2 (n=1).
Mixed RVA infection was observed in two samples.

CONCLUSION
Before the implementation of the vaccination program, the proportion of positive RVA tests had already begun to steadily decline.


RESULTS
A total of 176 patients with a median age of nine years (range 0.1 to 18 years) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
The source of stem cells were UCB, bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells in 86, 86 and four of the cases, respectively.
CMV infection occurred in 29 patients (16%).
At day 100 post-transplantation, the rate of CMV infection was 13% in UCB transplant recipients (11 of 86) versus 20% in those with other sources of graft (18 of 90) (P=0.19).
Positive CMV serology of the recipient and leukocyte depletion were two independent variables associated with an increased risk of CMV infection.
Among infected patients, six developed CMV disease (20.7%).
The rate of CMV disease one year after infection was 49% in patients who received UCB (five of 11) and 6% in others (one of 18).
This difference was significant by univariate (P=0.01) but not by multivariate analysis.


RESULTS
Of the 250 cases, 165 (65.7%) reported staying home or being hospitalized due to campylobacteriosis.
Fifty-four per cent of cases (135 of 249) reported taking antimicrobials to treat campylobacteriosis.
Of the 250 cases, 124 (49.6%) had available Campylobacter isolates, of which 66 (53.2%) were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested.
No resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol or gentamicin was found in these isolates.


RESULTS
The five SOT recipients (one liver, two kidney and two lung transplants) had a median age of 50 years (range 36 to 53 years), and three were male, who were a median time of three years (range two months to 15 years) post-transplant.
All patients were on a double or triple immunosuppressive regimen.
The prevaccination pH1N1 titre was 1:10 in four patients and 1:40 in one patient.
Seroprotection was observed only in one patient, with a rise in titre from 1:40 at baseline to 1:320 at both two and four weeks after vaccination.


RESULTS
Between 2001 and 2010, the prevalence of non-B HIV subtypes in patients with a known subtype increased from 7% to 24%.
In 2010, the most prevalent non-B subtypes were C (65%), A (11%), CRF02_AG (9.7%), CRF01_AE (4.9%), D (3.9%), G (2.9%) and CRF06_cpx (1.5%).
In the indexed analysis, there was an overall proportional increase in non-B subtypes of 2.3% per year.
The year-over-year increase in the prevalence of patients infected with a nonsubtype B virus increased from 13% from 1995 to 2002 to 27% from 2003 to 2010 (P=0.01).
Incident non-B subtype cases increased from 9.6% to 32.4% over these time periods.


RESULTS
Of 108 eligible OPAT patients, 21 were matched to the control group using the prespecified criteria.


OBJECTIVE
RESULT


RESULTS
In the positive group, the majority were male (62.5%); 75% were born in Africa (P=0.004) and 81.2% lived in refugee camps in Africa (P=0.002).


RESULTS
Of the 343 patients, 79% had a history of IDU, 77% were hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected and 67% were of Aboriginal descent.
The one-year and three-year immunological AIDS-free probabilities were 78% and 53%, respectively.
The one-year and three-year survival probabilities were 97% and 88%, respectively.
Multicollinearity among IDU, HCV and ethnicity was observed and, thus, separate models were built.
For survival, only treatment use was a significant predictor (HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.8]).
HCV coinfection was marginally significant (P=0.067).

CONCLUSION
Baseline CD4 count, HCV coinfection, year of diagnosis and treatment use were significant predictors of disease progression.


RESULTS
Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5%), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23%) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4%).
In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica).


RESULTS
In 2012, 56% of S aureus isolates were CA-MRSA strains, an increase from 31% in 2008 (P=0.06).
Reinfection rates have been increasing faster than new cases and, currrently, 25% of infections are reinfections.
CA-MRSA isolates continue to be susceptible to many common antibiotics (nearly 100%), particularly trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin and tetracycline.


RESULTS
Among 100 critically ill patients with bloodstream infection, the median duration of antibiotic treatment was 11 days, but was highly variable (interquartile range 4.5 to 17 days).
Predictors of shorter treatment (more antibiotic-free days) included vascular catheter source and bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococci.
Among 72 patients who survived to 10 days, clinical outcomes were similar between those receiving shorter and longer treatment.


RESULTS
The epidemic curve showed a periodicity with higher incidence in March and April.
Short-stay unit hospitalizations represented 58% of all hospitalizations.


RESULTS
The proportion of TMP-SMX-resistant E coli was 16.0% nationally (95% CI 11.3% to 21.8%).
This was not statistically higher than 2002 (10.9% [P=0.14]).
Nitrofurantoin-resistant E coli levels were low (0.5% [95% CI 0.01% to 2.7%).


RESULTS
For the entire study population and all studied viruses, the Spearman's rho was 0.702, suggesting a strong correlation with ED visits.

CONCLUSION
These findings support the use of an Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance system to track the incidence of respiratory viral disease in the community.


RESULTS
A total of 266 candidemia episodes were included in the final analysis.
Fifty-nine per cent of these episodes occurred in males and 51% were in patients >60 years of age.
Mixed candidemia was found in 10 episodes (4%); 80% grew C albicans and C glabrata.
Risk factors for mixed candidemia were not significantly different from those with monomicrobial candidemia.

CONCLUSION
However, non-albicans Candida species were overall predominant.
Mixed-species candidemia does not appear to be more prevalent in patients with identified risk factors.


RESULTS
In total, 21 patients (57%) developed active cytomegalovirus infection.
Discordant results were observed in 11 patients who were L-PCR-positive but sPCR-negative for active cytomegalovirus infection, five of whom developed clinical symptoms of cytomegalovirus.
Clinical symptoms were observed in 14 patients, 12 of whom were diagnosed with active infection by nested L-PCR (P=0.007) and seven by nested sPCR (P=0.02).
Higher specificity and a positive predictive value for sPCR were observed.


RESULTS
Thirty-six (42.4%) patients died within 30 days of the index MRSA culture.
Of the patients for whom MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method, 11 (14.1%) patients with MICs of 1.0 μg/mL died, and 16 (20.5%) survived (P=0.92).
The median APACHE II score of survivors was 22.5, and the median score of nonsurvivors was 25.0 (P=0.03).


RESULTS
A total of 111 patients had an enterococcal CA-BSI.
The median age was 58.2 years (range 21 to 94 years).

CONCLUSIONS
Mortality was increased among patients who had their catheter retained.
Additional prospective studies are necessary to determine the optimal management of enterococcal CA-BSI.


RESULTS
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS
Wide interhospital differences suggest that the predicament of limited access to health care of these groups of vulnerable medically uninsured children needs to be addressed through further research to inform policies and develop training.


RESULTS
A total of 2655 questionnaires were completed by 1376 males and 1279 females.

CONCLUSION
Nevertheless, helmet use decreased slightly during adolescence, and this decrease was particularly pronounced when helmet use was no longer mandatory.
Sophisticated multifaceted interventions may have the potential to increase the use of ski helmets among individuals who refuse to wear helmets.


RESULTS
Other main deterrents to vaccination were belief that the vaccine does not prevent influenza and belief that its side effects are greater than its benefits.


RESULTS
Thirteen records and 11 photographic charts were reviewed.
Lateral buttock flattening was noticeable in nine of 11 cases.
Three patients experienced some degree of inferior displacement of the gluteal crease.
All six patients available for the appointment presented with a zone of dysesthesia or hypoesthesia in the territory of the operated buttock and/or posterior thigh.
No motor impairment was found.
The questionnaire, completed by eight patients, revealed that six were satisfied or very satisfied with the surgery.
Appearance of the operated buttock was rated 3.4 on a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = normal) compared with the normal side.

CONCLUSIONS
The IGAP flap remains a suitable option for breast reconstruction in slim teenagers.
There is, however, less visible lateral depression when it is harvested as a perforator flap.


RESULTS
Between 2009 and 2011, 311 new patients with hemangiomas were seen, of whom 105 were treated with oral beta-blockers.
Forty-five patients completed beta-blocker treatment while the remainder continue to receive therapy.
Indications for treatment were either functional concerns (68.6%) or disfigurement (31.4%).
Ninety-nine patients (94.3%) responded to therapy with size reduction, colour changes, softened texture and/or healing of ulceration.
Resolution of the primary indication, requiring a median time of three months, occurred in 87 individuals (82.9%).


RESULTS
Forty per cent of invited members completed the survey (150 surgeons).


RESULTS
This was likely related to changing demographics and social factors.


RESULTS
No subsequent corrective surgery is required.


RESULTS
Of the 206 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 69 received radiotherapy and 137 did not.


RESULTS
The surgery and plastic surgery subgroup analyses also demonstrated statistically significant reduction in both catheter use and CAUTI.


RESULTS
Flap necrosis was observed in five (17.8%) patients.


RESULTS
Quality of life was similar between residents on the night float block and those on the standard rotation; it was also similar to age-matched Canadian normative data.


RESULTS
Side effects and absence of conviction were the main reasons for nonadherence.

CONCLUSION
Severity of disease and side effects are associated with nonadherence to treatment.
Strict follow-up appears to be a necessary adjunct in the adherence to treatment.
The association between demographic and cancer characteristics and treatment components needs further investigation.
However, these factors may help identify patients at risk of nonadherence and help the oncology team.


METHODS
We surveyed consecutively recruited patients awaiting bariatric surgery about 9 hypothetical scenarios describing patients waiting for surgery.
Respondents were asked to rank the priority of these hypothetical patients on the wait list relative to their own.
Scenarios examined variations in age, clinical severity, functional impairment, social dependence and socioeconomic status.

RESULTS
The 99 respondents had mean age of 44.7 ± 9.9 years, 76% were women, and the mean body mass index was 47.3 ± SD 7.6.
The mean wait for surgery was 34.4 ± 9.4 months.
Lower priority was assigned to patients at the extremes of age (p = 0.006), on social assistance (p < 0.001) and of high socioeconomic status (p < 0.001).
Most (85%) respondents disagreed with payment to expedite access, although participants earning more than $80 000/year were less likely to disagree.


RESULTS
We examined 12 delaminated cartilage flaps from 11 patients (10 men, 1 woman, average age 30.1 yr).
Ninety percent chondrocyte viability was confirmed in 11 of 12 flaps.


RESULTS
There was no statistical correlation between PCV use and OM visit frequency.


RESULTS
Surveys were completed by 93 (36.3%) of 256 eligible coordinators representing 134 different programs (response rate 52.3%).
Most programs encouraged seasonal influenza vaccination but only 28 (20.9%) required it.
In contrast, many programs across Canada delivered influenza vaccine and did not desire a centralized process.


RESULTS
A total of 260 STEC cases were reported, including 154 (59.2%) O157 cases, 63 (24.2%) non-O157 cases and 43 (16.5%) STEC cases with no serotype identified.


RESULTS
The cohort included 328 patients with a mean Pneumonia Severity Index score of 116 and a mean APACHE II score of 17; 84% required invasive mechanical ventilation.
Overall mortality was 54 of 328 (16%) at 30 days: 14 of 91 (15%) among patients treated with macrolides versus 40 of 237 (17%) for nonmacrolides (adjusted HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.50 to 1.74]; P=0.8).


RESULTS
A total of 490 blood cultures demonstrating Gram-positive cocci in clusters on Gram stain were evaluated.


RESULTS
Pooling data from historical clinic-based cohorts, IBD patients were more likely than controls to have ESBL colonization (19% versus 6.6%; P<0.05).
Antibiotic use on admission was associated with ESBL colonization among IBD inpatients (OR 4.2 [95% CI 1.4 to 12.6]).
The incidence of ARO infections during hospitalization was not significantly different between IBD patients and controls.
Among IBD patients who acquired ARO infections during hospitalizations, the mean time interval from admission to infection was shorter for those who were already colonized with ARO on admission.


CONCLUSIONS
The financial model illustrates a potential cost saving through the adoption of such a practice change.
For appropriately selected patients, ambulatory cleft surgery enhances overall health care value.


RESULTS
The response rate to the survey was 50%.
Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is required for the diagnosis of INHI in only four centres (50%).
The departments of intensive care, plastic surgery, otolaryngology and respirology are involved in performing fibreoptic bronchoscopy in 87.5%, 37.5%, 12.5% and 12.5% of Canadian burn centres, respectively.
Intubation for INHI is most often based on physical examination results (87.5%) and clinical history (75%).
Common treatments include intubation (87.5%), routine ventilatory support (87.5%) and chest physiotherapy (75%).
None of the centres used nebulized heparin.
A total of five centres (62.5%) routinely changed the fluid resuscitation protocol when INHI was diagnosed.
Only two centres (25%) routinely used prophylactic antibiotics for INHI.


RESULTS
The number of fasciotomies increased from 133 in 2005/2006 to 201 in 2008/2009, but dropped to 183 in 2009/2010.
The highest rate of fasciectomies was performed for the age groups 65 to 69 years and 70 to 74 years.


RESULTS
Most (87.8%) facilities obtained medical histories after the youth arrived, and 92% used health care professionals to perform that assessment.
Continuous health education was provided by 76% of facilities.
Facility type and type of management appear to be related to some areas of health services provision.


RESULTS
Fax communication was also used more frequently by paediatricians (84%) than by general practitioners (15%).


RESULTS
The most common barriers reported for recommending the guidelines were insufficient motivation or support from parents, caregivers or youth, and lack of time.


RESULTS
Data from 165 individuals were included.
Among those with follow-up anthropometric data, weight stabilization occurred at three (n=127) and seven months (n=84).
Program attrition increased over time (23%, 49% and 73% at three-, seven- and 11-month follow-ups, respectively).


OBJECTIVE
Cognitive control deficits are commonly seen in Depression of Bipolar Disorder (BDd) and Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (UDd).

RESULTS
There were no significant behavioral or neuroimaging findings between adolescents with BDd and UDd.
However, both groups relative to HC showed significantly higher left superior temporal and left caudate activity during the NoGo condition.
In addition, several neural regions including dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) were positively correlated with increased reaction time in UDd - not BDd - adolescents.


CONCLUSIONS
Recent evidence suggests that social communication may be an appropriate target for pharmacologic manipulation.


RESULTS
The use of PMMC led to significant changes in direct care staff's awareness and beliefs associated with medication monitoring.
An increase in staff-physician communication with direct care staff was marginally significant.
Staff ratings of the PMMC exceeded mild levels of satisfaction, indicating that the checklists were a well-received and useful tool for monitoring SE in a residential care setting.


RESULTS
All published RCTs showed superiority over placebo on the primary outcome measure.
Subgroup analysis of available RCT data showed no efficacy of GXR at any dose in adolescents.
Adverse effects in GXR trials were generally mild to moderate.
High rates of early discontinuation were observed in long-term open-label extension trials.


RESULTS
Length of stay was not affected.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A 53-year-old male was involved in a car accident and was transported to the hospital.
Cervical radiographs were taken at the emergency department and interpreted as normal.
Four days later, he consulted a chiropractor where radiographs of the cervical spine were repeated.


RESULTS
We received 57 questionnaires (23% response rate).
Most respondents would accumulate over $125,000 in student loan debt by graduation.
Financial knowledge was low (mean 77%).
Most respondents (72%) scored as average financial risk takers.
Few saved money for unplanned expenses (39%) or long-term goals (26%), kept written budgets (32%), or had retirement accounts (19%).


CONCLUSIONS
The protocol of this study was acceptable to all subjects who were invited to participate.
No participants refused randomization.


RESULTS
ECG interpretation was performed by 124 general paediatricians.
General paediatricians frequently use ECGs in their practice and regard this investigation as useful in patient assessment.
The mean (± SD) accuracy of identifying ECGs as normal or abnormal, and identifying the specific abnormality was 80±12% and 56±20%, respectively.
The sensitivity and specificity of identifying abnormal ECGs were 80% (95% CI 78% to 82%) and 79% (95% CI 75% to 83%), respectively.
Overall confidence in ECG interpretation correlated with and was the only significant predictor of interpretation accuracy (r=0.396, P<0.001).


RESULTS
A total of 389 responses were received, representing health care providers in many disciplines.


CONCLUSION
Parents are highly supportive of bicycle helmet legislation in Canada.


RESULTS
We observed differences in the characteristics of suicide cases according to area of residence.

CONCLUSION
Local adjustments may improve suicide prevention strategies.


BACKGROUND
Hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures among Canadian women.

RESULTS
Interprovincial variations in hysterectomy prevalence were observed among women in each age group and time period.


RESULTS
After adjusting for age, we found that 14.9% of Canadian adults had MetS.
Rates were similar in both sexes, but higher in those who are non-Caucasian or overweight or obese (p < .

CONCLUSION
Thus, MetS may be a relevant risk factor in the development of chronic disease.


RESULTS
We interviewed 16 representatives from all provinces and territories in Canada and found 30 publicly available and relevant provincial and national documents.
Most provinces and territories have policies that incorporate aspects of chronic disease self-management.
Alberta and British Columbia have the most detailed policies.
Both feature primary care prominently and are not disease specific.

CONCLUSION
Engaging patients in self-management of their chronic diseases is important and effective.


METHODS
During a 10-day mass vaccination campaign against meningitis A in three regions of Chad in 2011, the costs associated with storage and transport of the vaccine in a traditional cold chain system were evaluated.


METHODS
The overall scores were then ranked.


METHODS
The possible mediating effect of annual per capita intake of soft drinks, animal fats and total calories on the association between fast food consumption and BMI was also analysed.

FINDINGS
Only the intake of soft drinks--not animal fat or total calories--mediated the observed association (β: 0.030; 95% CI: 0.010-0.050).
Economic freedom was an independent predictor of fast food consumption (β: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.16-0.37).
When economic freedom was used as an instrumental variable, the association between fast food and BMI weakened but remained significant (β: 0.023; 95% CI: 0.001-0.045).


METHODS
Human development indexes were used to categorize the states where hospitals were located as having generally high, intermediate or low socioeconomic status.
Annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea--per 10,000 hospitalizations for any cause--were calculated.
Administrative data were used to estimate vaccine coverage.

FINDINGS
In the states with high, intermediate and low socioeconomic status, coverage with a two-dose monovalent RVA vaccine--among children younger than 5 years--had reached 93%, 86% and 71%, respectively, by 2010.
The corresponding median annual rates of hospitalization for diarrhoea--per 10,000 admissions--fell from 1001, 834 and 1033 in the "prevaccine" period of 2003-2006, to 597, 497 and 705 in the "postvaccine" period from 2008 to 2011, respectively.
These decreases correspond to rate reductions of 40% (95% confidence interval, CI: 38-43), 41% (95% CI: 38-43) and 32% (95% CI: 29-34), respectively.
Nationwide, RVA vaccination appeared to have averted approximately 16,500 hospitalizations for childhood diarrhoea in each year of the postvaccine period.


APPROACH
Clinical "dashboards" based on locally available data offer a way of providing accurate and timely information.
It provides rapid feedback on local outcomes in an accessible form and enables problems to be detected early.
Until now, dashboards have been used only in high-resource settings.


RESULTS
The median maternal age was 23 years, and 18.4% were <20 years of age.
Eight mothers (16.3%) were Aboriginal (non-Aboriginal birth prevalence 3.9 per 100,000; Aboriginal birth prevalence 15.8 per 100,000; P<0.005).
The most common laboratory abnormality was thrombocytopenia (53.1%).

CONCLUSION
Only a minority of the expected number of symptomatic cCMV-infected infants were reported in the present study.
The majority of these severely affected infants, including those with neurological disease, are not being treated with ganciclovir.


METHODS
The total time required for all verification-related activities was captured.
Data were collected over 3 weeks in early 2011.

RESULTS
Of the 250 patients admitted, 51 (20.4%) had a prescription for one of their own multidose medications.
Verification was completed for 67 (79%) of 85 prescribed items, of which 61 (91%) were deemed suitable for use.
Thirty-five different medication types were identified.
Of the 85 prescribed medications, 57 (67%) were on formulary.
The most common routes of administration for these 85 prescribed items were inhalation (56 [66%]), nasal (9 [11%]), and ophthalmic (8 [9%]).
The average cost ± standard deviation was $24.54 ± $32.33 per multi-dose item.
The average time required for verification was 10.5 ± 6.7 min per patient (4.8 ± 3.3 min per medication).
The average cost impact was $40.05 ± $42.60 per patient (p < 0.001 by 1-sample t test) ($18.85 ± $15.42 per medication).
A total cost saving of $1601.85 was realized.


CONCLUSIONS
This lack of information may relate to the mechanism of action of 5-ASA.


RESULTS
There were 367 cases of SSTI diagnosed over the study period.
Forty-five (12.3%) patients had lesions that were swabbed for culture and sensitivity.
S aureus was the most common organism found, with 14 (66%) methicillin-sensitive cases and seven (33%) methicillin-resistant cases.
Of the seven cases of MRSA identified, only one patient had clear risk factors for hospital-acquired MRSA.
First-generation cephalosporins were initially prescribed for 280 (76%) patients.


RESULTS
A total of 347 patients from Canada with documented IFIs were enrolled in the Prospective Antifungal Therapy Alliance registry.
Infections occurred most commonly in general medicine (71.8%), nontransplant surgery (32.6%) and patients with hematological malignancies (21.0%).
There were 287 proven IFIs, including 248 Candida infections.
Forty-six patients had invasive aspergillosis (IA); all of these were probable infections.
Fluconazole was the most common therapy used for Candida infections, followed by the echinocandins.
Voriconazole therapy was most commonly prescribed for IA.

CONCLUSIONS
The present study demonstrated that general medicine, surgery and hematological malignancy patients in Canada are susceptible to developing IFIs.
In contrast to the United States, Candida albicans remains responsible for most IFIs in these Canadian centres.


RESULTS
Utilization rose more than sevenfold throughout the study period, from 21.3 DDD per 1000 person-years in 2001 to 163.3 DDD per 1000 person-years in 2010.
Although the formulary addition was not associated with an immediate increase in utilization (7.5% [95% CI -4.4% to 20.9%]; P=0.226), it was associated with an overall increase in utilization of 2.1% (95% CI 1.3% to 3.0%; P<0.001) for every month after 2009.
Overall, only 29% of moxifloxacin prescriptions could be linked to a diagnostic code that was considered to be guideline concordant.
In more than one-half of moxifloxacin prescriptions, the patient had not used another antibiotic in the previous 90 days.
Among moxifloxacin prescriptions in which another antibiotic had been used in the previous 90 days, 41.5% were prescriptions for an alternative fluoroquinolone.

CONCLUSIONS
The formulary addition was associated with a sustained increase in moxifloxacin utilization over time.


RESULTS
Current cannabis use was identified in 38.5% (87 of 226) of participants.


RESULTS
A total of 169 subjects were evaluated.
During the study period, 78 patients with BSIs were documented.
Twenty-three BSIs (29.4%) were a result of CoNS.
In a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, BSIs caused by CoNS were independently associated with lower mortality (HR 0.09 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.74]).


RESULTS
Coinfected individuals were more likely to be male (88.1% versus 71.3%; P<0.001) and to have died (34.3% versus 17.9%; P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS
The pattern of coinfections in Northern Alberta likely follows immigration trends.


CONCLUSIONS
This difference may be due to improved survival of high-risk patients in centres with multidisciplinary teams, and a uniform feeding approach for all patients.


RESULTS
A total of 97 of 100 eligible hospitals responded.
Seventy-seven of the 97 (79%) respondents reported having implemented universal neonatal bilirubin screening.


RESULTS
Data from 52 healthy Cree children (mean [± SD] age 11.1±2.0 years; 27 boys) were included in the analyses.
The median serum 25(OH)D level was 52.4 nmol/L (range 22.1 nmol/L to 102.7 nmol/L).
Obese children had lower vitamin D levels; however, the difference was nonsignificant.


METHODS
The primary outcomes examined were postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality.


METHODS
We asked all orthopedic surgery residents at a single institution to complete an electronic version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).
We used completed questionnaires to calculate total EI scores and 4 branch scores.
Data were analyzed according to a priori cutoff values to determine the proportion of residents who were considered competent on the test.
Data were also analyzed for possible associations with age, sex, race and level of training.

RESULTS
Thirty-nine residents (100%) completed the MSCEIT.
The mean total EI score was 86 (maximum score 145).
Only 4 (10%) respondents demonstrated competence in EI.
Junior residents (p = 0.026), Caucasian residents (p = 0.009) and those younger than 30 years (p = 0.008) had significantly higher EI scores.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the cases of all adult patients in Ontario aged 18-80 years with diagnosed colon cancer who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy and underwent resection electively between Jan. 1, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2009.
Wait times were measured from the date of surgical consultation to the date of surgery.
We chose a wait time of 28 days, reflecting local administrative targets, as a comparative benchmark.
Variables were analyzed in continuous linear and logistic regression models.

RESULTS
We included 10 223 patients in our study.
The median wait time from initial surgical consultation to resection was 31 (range 0-182) days.
Age older than 65 years had a negative impact on wait time.
Wait times were longer in rural hospitals.


RESULTS
We included 166 patients (mean age 44 yr, 82% female) in our study.
The mean preoperative body mass index was 49.61.
At baseline, 87 (52%) patients had type 2 diabetes.
For this subgroup, mean preoperative HbA1c and AC glucose were 7.6% and 8.3 mmol/L, respectively.
The mean duration of surgery was 93 minutes.
Major complications included 1 staple line leak (0.6%), and 2 patients required reintervention for bleeding (1.2%).
The mean hospital stay was 2.6 days.
Two patients required readmission (1.2%).
Seven minor complications occurred (4%).
Postoperative excess weight loss was 49.3% at 6 months, 54.2% at 12 months and 64.4% at 24 months.
In the type 2 diabetes subgroup, resolution occurred in 78% and improvement in 7% of patients at 12 months.

CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be safely performed at Canadian teaching hospitals.


METHODS
We identified patients with ischemic steal syndrome caused by an AVF originating from the brachial artery level who were eligible for the DRIL procedure.

RESULTS
Our series involved 10 patients with a mean age of 66.5 (range 53-81) years.
Four patients were women and 8 had diabetes.
All patients had grade 3 ischemic steal syndrome with ischemic rest pain and/or ischemic tissue loss.


RESULTS
A total of 13 studies reported on 325 patients.
The duration of surgery was 40-98 minutes for unilateral hernia and 41-121 minutes for bilateral repairs.
Three studies involving 287 patients compared LESS TEP (n = 128) with LAP TEP (n = 159).
There was a trend toward earlier return to activity in the LESS TEP group (p = 0.07).

CONCLUSION
Laparoendoscopic single site surgery TEP hernia repair is a relatively new technique and appears to be safe and effective.


RESULTS
Of the 84 eligible residents, 49 participated: 22 in the nonintervention and 27 in the intervention group.

CONCLUSION
A simple orientation designed to reduce stereotype threat was unsuccessful in reducing this threat overall.


RESULTS
Our study involved 9 patients.
The median number of liver metastases resected was 10 (range 4-50).
Symptomatic improvement was observed in all patients.
Immediate postoperative normalization of 5-HIAA 24-hour urine levels occurred in 89% of patients.
Symptomatic and biochemical response remained stable or improved in 75% of patients at 12 months of follow-up.
Four patients had postoperative complications.
There was no 90-day mortality.

CONCLUSION
The described HPP approach is feasible and safe.
Most patients experienced symptomatic and biochemical improvement.


RESULTS
Fifty-five spine surgeons completed our survey, for a response rate of 55%.
Half of the respondents refused to see 20% or more of all patients referred for spine-related complaints.


METHODS
Frequencies were compared using the χ(2) test.

RESULTS
Pre-ACCESS, 366 EGS procedures were performed: 24% during the day, 55% in the evening and 21% at night.
Post-ACCESS, 463 operations were performed: 55% during the day, 36% in the evening and 9% at night.
Reductions in night-time and evening EGS were 57% and 36% respectively (p < 0.001).


INTRODUCTION
The use of medical office assistants (MOAs) to do key tasks in diabetes care may improve the effectiveness of care and reduce costs.
We sought to determine whether an expanded MOA role in a rural practice was beneficial to patients and the practice.


INTRODUCTION
Few studies have examined the effect of clinical teaching on patient satisfaction in rural and community-based settings.


FINDINGS
During 2009-2011, 367 notifiable measles cases occurred in Australia (mean annual rate: 5.5 cases per million population).
Data were 100% complete for importation status but 77% complete for outbreak reference number.


METHODS
The cumulative case ratio for malaria-related visits to these facilities was determined using data from the Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project.
Catchment areas were also derived using various straight line and road network distances from the facility.

FINDINGS
The 1-year cumulative malaria case rate varied considerably with the method used to define the catchment areas.
With the cumulative case ratio approach, the catchment area could include noncontiguous areas.
With the distance approaches, the denominator increased substantially with distance, whereas the numerator increased only slightly.


METHODS
Data from a cervical cancer screening programme embedded in two HIV clinic sites in western Kenya were evaluated.
Women at a central site underwent VIA, while women at a peripheral site underwent VIA/VILI.
All women positive for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN 2+) on VIA and/or VILI had a confirmatory colposcopy, with a biopsy if necessary.
Overall test positivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and the CIN 2+ detection rate were calculated for the two screening methods, with biopsy being the gold standard.

FINDINGS
Histologically confirmed CIN 2+ was detected in 8.9% and 7.8% (P = 0.27) of women in the VIA and VIA/VILI groups, respectively.


APPROACH
During each of seven supplementary immunization activities against polio in Karachi, mobile phone numbers of the caregivers of a random sample of eligible children were obtained.
Persistent non-responders were phoned directly by an investigator.

LESSONS LEARNT
Such systems may be useful in other large-scale immunization campaigns.


METHODS
In Soweto, South Africa, mother-infant pairs who were uninfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were enrolled as they presented for the "6-week" immunizations of the infants.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to evaluate the titres of rotavirus-specific IgA in samples of serum collected from each infant immediately before each vaccine dose and 1 month after the second dose.
Among the infants, a fourfold or greater increase in titres of rotavirus-specific IgA following vaccination was considered indicative of seroconversion.


METHODS
Women were selected in 2012 to complete a structured interview from a full census of all 30076 households in clinic catchment areas in Pwani region.
Demographic and delivery care information and opinions on the quality of obstetric care were collected through interviews.
Clinic characteristics were collected from staff via questionnaires.
Determinants of bypassing (i.e. delivery of the youngest child at a health centre or hospital without provider referral) were analysed using multivariate logistic regression.
Bypasser and non-bypasser birth experiences were compared in bivariate analyses.

FINDINGS
Of 3019 eligible women interviewed (93% response rate), 71.0% (2144) delivered in a health facility; 41.8% (794) were bypassers.


METHODS
A search was conducted of the published literature reporting total mercury (Hg) in hair and blood in women and infants.
These biomarkers are validated proxy measures of MeHg, a neurotoxin found primarily in seafood.

FINDINGS
Selection criteria were met by 164 studies of women and infants from 43 countries.
In coastal regions of south-eastern Asia, the western Pacific and the Mediterranean, average biomarkers approach the reference.
Although the two former groups have a higher risk of neurotoxicity than the latter, coastal regions are home to the largest number at risk.
High-end biomarkers across all categories indicate MeHg intake is in excess of the reference value.


APPROACH
By 2008, the target coverage was 80% of households and the Global Fund had financed a phased scale-up of LLIN distribution in the region.

LOCAL SETTING
South Sudan's entire population is considered to be at risk of malaria.


RELEVANT CHANGES
On 31 March 2013, China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of the first recorded human infections with A(H7N9) virus.
Poultry markets - which were rapidly identified as a major source of transmission of A(H7N9) to humans - were closed down in the affected areas.
Surveillance in humans and poultry was heightened and technical guidelines were quickly updated and disseminated.
The health authorities collaborated with WHO in risk assessments and risk communication.
New cases were reported promptly and publicly.


METHODS
On study day 0, twelve 3.5-mg vials of powdered bortezomib were each reconstituted with 1.4 mL of NS to prepare solutions with concentration 2.5 mg/mL.
Half of the solutions were subsequently stored in the original vials and half were transferred to syringes.
Three of each type of container were stored in the refrigerator (4°C) and the other 3 of each type were stored at room temperature (23°C).
Concentration analysis and physical inspection were completed on study days 0, 1, 2, 8, 12, 14, 19, and 21.
The concentration of bortezomib was determined by a validated liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection.
The expiry date was determined according to the time to achieve 90% of the initial concentration, based on the fastest degradation rate calculated from the 95% confidence interval of the observed degradation rate.


RESULTS
Overall, 82 (61%) of 134 MMS criteria could be paired with results from the 2009/2010 Hospital Pharmacy in Canada survey.
The average calculated discrepancy ratio (± standard deviation) between the 2 sets of results was 0.62 ± 0.29 (range 0.05 to 1.19).
For 59 criteria, there was a significant discrepancy between the 2010 MMS on-site surveys and the 2009/2010 Hospital Pharmacy in Canada survey.

CONCLUSION
Further studies are required to explore the reasons for such discrepancies.


METHODS
A chart review was conducted from January to March 2011 to establish a baseline of empiric antibiotic use.
A post-intervention audit was conducted from January to March 2012 to determine changes in practice.

RESULTS
There was also a significant change in overall antibiotic selection (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.58; p < 0.001).
Further analysis suggested that this significant change was driven by a decrease in use of ciprofloxacin, from 32% (31/96) to 11% (8/76).


RESULTS
Of the 176 patients with high trough levels included in the analysis, 24 (14%) experienced nephrotoxicity.


METHODS
Monthly positivity rates were then calculated to define annual peaks of influenza activity in each country and across countries.

FINDINGS
Influenza activity peaked between June/July and October in seven countries, three of which showed a second peak in December to February.
Countries closer to the equator had year-round circulation without discrete peaks.
Viral types and subtypes varied from year to year but not across countries in a given year.
The cumulative proportion of specimens that tested positive from June to November was > 60% in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam.
Thus, these tropical and subtropical countries exhibited earlier influenza activity peaks than temperate climate countries north of the equator.


FINDINGS
Between 2005 and October 2013, 596 391 measles cases and 368 measles-related deaths were reported in China.
Between 2008 and 2012, the incidence of measles in all age groups, including those not targeted for vaccination, decreased by at least 93.6%.
However, resurgence started in late 2012 and continued into 2013.
Of the cases reported in January to October 2013, 40% were aged 8 months to 6 years.


FINDINGS
Overall, 258 RCTs were found on American trypanosomiasis, Buruli ulcer, dengue, geohelminth infection, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, rabies, schistosomiasis or trachoma.
No RCTs were found on cysticercosis, dracunculiasis, echinococcosis, foodborne trematodes, or human African trypanosomiasis.
The most studied diseases were geohelminth infection (51 RCTs) and leishmaniasis (46 RCTs).
Vaccines, chemoprophylaxis and interventions targeting insect vectors were evaluated in 113, 99 and 39 RCTs, respectively.
Few addressed how best to deliver preventive chemotherapy, such as the choice of dosing interval (10) or target population (4), the population coverage needed to reduce transmission (2) or the method of drug distribution (1).
Together, they included only 79 of the 258 published RCTs (30.6%).
Of 36 interventions assessed, 8 were judged effective in more than one review.


RELEVANT CHANGES
The B Positive programme has been informed by economic modelling.


RESULTS
Seventeen cohort studies were included.
Thirteen studies were supportive of the intervention, while four were neutral.


RESULTS
A total of 68 residents responded.
They reported 23 procedures for which they felt somewhat to not proficient (mean <3).
The correlation between importance and proficiency was high (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.87).
However, proficiency was significantly lower than importance (P<0.05) for the majority of procedures (88%).
The largest gaps between importance and proficiency were observed for chest tube insertion, gathering evidence of child maltreatment, defibrillation and intraosseous insertion.


CONCLUSIONS
Lower mortality rates did not correlate well with the prevalence of cerebral palsy.


RESULTS
A response rate of 67% (72 of 108) was obtained.

CONCLUSIONS
Noninvasive methods to limit procedural pain are underutilized.


RESULTS
Seventeen cohort studies were included.
Thirteen studies were supportive of the intervention, while four were neutral.


RESULTS
Internet sources were the main form of nutrition information used by parents.


OBJECTIVES
Sociodemographic and health predictors of risk for developmental delay were also examined.

RESULTS
The ranges in which children achieve certain developmental milestones are presented.


RESULTS
All participants were female (mean age 17 years).
Forty-two percent were pregnant at initial assessment, while the remainder had one or two children, or a recent pregnancy loss.
Sixty-one percent had no primary care physician.
The primary reason for referral was mental health concerns, most commonly depression.
Almost one-half of patients relied on social assistance and almost one-third were living in shelters.
The majority had a history of mental health issues and previous drug and/or alcohol use.


RESULTS
A total of 1340 charts of children who presented with extremity fracture from January 2008 to December 2010 were reviewed.
The mean (± SD) age of the study population was 9.1±4.0 years and 62.1% were male.
Overall, 19.9% (95% CI 17.8% to 22.0%) were obese and 39.6% (95% CI 36.7% to 39.1%) sustained a severe extremity fracture.
In addition, the OR of experiencing complications among obese relative to nonobese children was 1.12 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.85).


RESULTS
A total of 49.5% of children were obese/overweight and 31.9% had elevated blood pressure.
On average, children consumed 2.7 L of sugar-sweetened beverages weekly and <2 servings of fruits or vegetables daily.
Children spent approximately 2 h per day watching television, playing games or using a computer.

CONCLUSION
There is an urgent need for community-based approaches to address the high rates of obesity and related cardiovascular risk factors among these Aboriginal children.


RESULTS
Internet sources were the main form of nutrition information used by parents.


RESULTS
There were no significant differences in the distribution of PFGE types in patients with PB or RB (37% CMRSA-2/USA100; 37% CMRSA-10/USA300) compared with that in other patients (56% CMRSA-2/USA100; 32% CMRSA-10/USA300).
All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, but patients with PB or RB were more likely to have initial isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 μg/mL (26% versus 10%; P=0.06).


RESULTS
Incremental costs per recurrence avoided increased with increasing proportion of cases caused by the NAP1/B1/027 strain.
were sensitive to variations in recurrence rates and treatment duration but were robust to variations in other parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
The use of fidaxomicin is associated with a cost increase for the Canadian health care system.


RESULTS
Significant differences among provinces were found, as well as significant changes in use over time.
Newfoundland and Labrador was found to have significantly higher prescribing rates than all other provinces (P<0.001) in 2010, as well as the mean of all other provinces (P<0.001).
In contrast, Quebec exhibited significantly lower prescribing than all other provinces (P<0.001 for all provinces except British Columbia, where P=0.024) and the mean of all other provinces (P<0.001).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION


RESULTS
After accounting for repeated measures over time, prescribing rates (PrIDs) varied significantly according to province and year (P<0.001).
Quebec and British Columbia had significantly lower prescribing rates than all other provinces.
No overall secular trend was apparent.


RESULTS
Significant differences among provinces were found, as well as significant changes in use over time.


RESULTS
Prescribing of all three groups varied according to province and over time.


RESULTS
ST19A tended to cause disease in younger patients.
ST19A isolates were more often multidrug resistant (19% versus 0.3%; P<0.001).
Adjusted logistic regression showed no difference in intensive care unit admission between ST19A and non-ST19A IPD cases (OR 1.4 [95% CI 0.8 to 2.7]).


RESULTS
We found that RAE was weak and was only evident when birth dates were broken into year halves.
Players born in the first half of the year were relatively advantaged for entry into the NHL.
We found that the RAE is smaller than reported in previous studies.
Players who were not drafted (e.g., free agents) or who played university hockey in North America had no apparent RAE.

CONCLUSION
We found little evidence of an RAE in the current NHL player rosters.


METHODS
We studied all emergency cholecystectomies performed over a 1-year period.
The reviewers were blinded to each other's results.

RESULTS
A total of 107 patients required an emergency cholecystectomy in the study period; 83 of them underwent ultrasonography.
Interradiologist agreement was 92% for ultrasonography.
For cholelithiasis, ultrasonography had 100% sensitivity, 18% specificity, 81% positive predictive value (PPV) and 100% negative predictive value (NPV).
For acute cholecystitis, it had 54% sensitivity, 81% specificity, 85% PPV and 47% NPV.
All patients had chronic cholecystitis and 67% had acute cholecystitis on histology.


METHODS
We compared fracture displacement on initial supine chest radiographs and follow-up radiographs.

RESULTS
Ninety-five patients with clavicle fractures met the inclusion criteria.
On follow-up, 57 (60.0%) had displacement of 100% or more of the shaft width.


METHODS
Postoperative nausea and vomiting, length of hospital stay (LOS), time to return to regular diet and patient satisfaction at discharge were evaluated.

RESULTS
There were 36 patients in our study.
Demographic characteristics were similar between the groups.
The total amount of consumed fentanyl and the total administration frequency of PCA were significantly lower in the lidocaine than the control group.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the data of all patients treated for spinal metastasis between March 2003 and March 2012 in our centre.
The 2 scores were also compared with one another.

RESULTS
We identified 128 patients with spinal metastasis.
The average survival of patients with predicted poor, average and good prognosis was 5, 17 and 25 months, respectively for the modified Tokuhashi score and 3, 16 and 19 months, respectively, for the Tomita score.
Poor, average and good prognosis predictions differed significantly from one another for all 3 categories for the Tokuhashi score (all p < 0.05).
There was no significant difference in the moderate and good prognoses for the Tomita score (p = 0.15).
When comparing both scores, we obtained a weighted κ of 0.4489 (standard deviation 0.0568, 95% confidence interval 0.3376-0.5602), demonstrating moderate agreement between scores.


RESULTS
Of the 1168 consultations for appendicitis that took place during our study period, 349 occurred preimplementation, 392 occurred postimplementation, and 427 were follow-up visits.
In all, 877 (75%) patients were admitted to the ACS service.
Overall, 83% of patients underwent surgery within 6 hours.
The mean wait time from CT request to obtaining the CT scan decreased with pathway implementation at all sites (197 v. 143 min, p < 0.001).
This improvement was sustained at 12-month followup (131 min, p < 0.001).
The pathway increased the number of CTs completed in under 2 hours from 3% to 42% (p < 0.001).
No decrease in the total number of CTs or the pattern of ultrasonography was noted (p = 0.42).
Wait times from ED triage to surgery were shortened (665 min preimplementation, 633 min postimplementation, 631 min at the 12-month follow-up, p = 0.040).


METHODS
We assessed telomerase activity using real time polymerase chain reaction.
Several pathological characteristics of tumours, including p53, Ki-67, p21, bcl2 and MLH1 expression were also studied.

RESULTS
We collected samples from 49 patients.
There was a significantly higher telomerase activity in colon cancer tissue than normal tissue.
Adenocarcinomas of the right colon express significantly higher telomerase than left-side cancers.
The expression of p53 negatively correlated to telomerase activity and was linked to better patient survival.


METHODS
We searched the reference lists of recent reviews evaluating LIPUS and ESTIM that included studies published up to 2011 from 4 electronic databases.
We updated the searches of all electronic databases up to April 2012.
Eligible trials were those that included patients with a fresh fracture or an existing delayed union or nonunion who were randomized to LIPUS or ESTIM as well as a control group.
We used standard and network meta-analytic techniques to synthesize the data.

RESULTS
Of the 27 eligible trials, 15 provided data for our analyses.


METHODS
Electrocardiography and cardiac biomarkers were obtained 1 day before surgery, and on postoperative days 1, 3 and 7.

RESULTS
Of the 1340 patients undergoing NCS, 31 (2.3%) experienced PAIS.


RESULTS
Among the 351 identified patients (median ISS 18; median hospital stay 6 d; mortality 6.6%), significantly more were injured on the weekend than during the week (54.8% v. 45.2%, p = 0.016).
Common mechanisms were motocross (23.6%), hiking or mountain/rock climbing (15.4%), skateboarding or rollerblading (12.3%), hockey/ice-skating (10.3%) and aircraft- (9.9%) and water-related (7.7%) activities.
This distribution was similar regardless of the day of the week.
Injury patterns were similar across both groups (all p > 0.05): head (55.8%), spine (35.1%), chest (35.0%), extremities (31.1%), face (17.4%), abdomen (13.1%).
Surgical intervention was required in 41% of patients: 15.1% required open reduction and internal fixation, 8.3% spinal fixation, 7.4% craniotomy, 5.1% facial repair and 4.3% laparotomy.


RESULTS
A total of 258 international clinicians completed the survey.
Respondents were typically fellowship-trained (78%), with a mean of 16 years' experience in a university-affiliated (93%) hepato-pancreato-biliary group (96%) practice.
Most (91%) believed resection is potentially curative.
Most patients were discussed preoperatively by multidisciplinary teams (94%) and medical assessment clinics (68%), but rarely critical care (21%).
Intraoperative surgical palliation included double bypass or no intervention for locally advanced nonresectable tumours (41% and 49% v. 14% and 85%, respectively, for patients with hepatic metastases).
Postoperative admission to the intensive care unit was frequent (58%).
Admitting surgeons guided most end-of-life decisions (97%).
Clinician experience, regional culture and training background impacted treatment (all p < 0.05).


RESULTS
During the study period, 73 consecutive patients underwent ASD patch repair at our institution: 51 (age 47 ± 16 yr, 66.7% women) in the MT group and 22 (age 46 ± 21 yr, 59.1% women) in the sternotomy group.
In-hospital mortality was similar between the 2 groups (MT 0% v. sternotomy 4.5%, p = 0.30).
There were no significant differences in any postoperative complications or blood product requirements.
No patients in the MT group suffered stroke, retrograde aortic dissection or leg ischemia.
Mean intensive care unit (MT 1.2 ± 1.2 d v. sternotomy 1.7 ± 2.2 d, p = 0.26) and hospital length of stays (MT 5.1 ± 2.2 d v. sternotomy 6.3 ± 3.6 d, p = 0.17) were similar between the groups; however, there was a trend toward fewer patients requiring prolonged hospital stays (> 10 d) in the MT group (3.9% v. 18.2%, p = 0.06).


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed all open fractures treated in a single level 1 trauma centre in a 5-year period.
Prior to the study, a protocol was adopted standardizing management of open fractures and advocating primary closure of all wounds as a necessary goal of operative treatment.

RESULTS
A total of 297 open fractures were treated, 255 (85.8%) of them with immediate primary closure.
Type III open injuries accounted for 24% of all injuries.
Wounds that were immediately closed had a superficial infection rate of 11% and a deep infection rate of 4.7%.


METHODS
During SILA, the single port was prepared to increase visibility of the operative site.

RESULTS
Our analysis included 688 consecutive patients: 618 who underwent CLA and 70 who underwent SILA.


METHODS
We assessed 2 separate cohorts of primary ACLR patients, SB and DB, for 14 days postoperatively.
Pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS).
Medications were divided into 3 categories: oral opioids, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories and acetaminophen.

RESULTS
A total of 88 patients undergoing SB and 41 undergoing DB ACLR were included in the study.
We found no significant difference in VAS pain scores between the cohorts.


CONCLUSION
The use of technologies plays a major role in the delivery of mental health services and supports to children and youth in providing prevention, assessment, diagnosis, counseling and treatment programs.
Strategies are growing exponentially on a global basis, thus it is critical to study the impact of these technologies on child and youth mental health service delivery.
An in-depth review and synthesis of the quality of findings of studies on effectiveness of the use of technologies in service delivery are also warranted.
A full systematic review would provide that opportunity.


RESULTS
The mean age of the 123 youth who participated was 15.74 (SD 1.51) years, and 90 of 121 (74.38%) reported being female.


RESULTS
Both AMPS and CAPS-14 scores were associated with the severity of OCD symptoms in our sample.


INTRODUCTION
Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is characterized by specific kinetic and kinematic parameters that can be modulated.


FINDINGS
The relative health performance of the five study countries differed markedly over the study period.
Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed.
India's improvement was more modest and more varied across the subgroups.
South Africa and the Russian Federation exhibited large declines in health performance as well as large sex-specific inequalities in health.
Although China's levels of avoidable mortality decreased in absolute terms, the level of improvement appeared low in the context of China's economic growth.


FINDINGS
Four of the BRICS countries showed increases in both income level and income inequality between 1990 and 2010.
The exception was Brazil, where income inequality decreased over the same period.
Throughout the study period, there was disproportionality in the burden of disease between BRICS.
However, the national infant mortality rate fell substantially over the study period in all five countries.
In Brazil and China, the magnitude of subnational income-related inequalities in infant mortality, both absolute and relative, also decreased substantially.


METHODS
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were used to examine the influence of these interventions on smoking prevalence.


LOCAL SETTING
In spite of rapid economic growth since the early 1980s, income disparities in China have increased, particularly between rural and urban populations.
In response, the government has put greater emphasis on social development, including health system development.
Examples are the prioritization of improved access to health services and the reduction of the burden of payment for necessary services.


METHODS
A total of 6 infusion bags were prepared with 200 mL of epinephrine solution, 2 bags for each of 3 standard concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μg/mL).
Three bags (one for each concentration) were stored under refrigeration (4°C), and the remaining 3 bags were stored at room temperature (25°C).
Physical characteristics (including pH, colour, and presence of precipitate) were evaluated daily for the first 14 days and every 1 to 5 days thereafter until day 30.
Three 1.5-mL samples were collected from each bag immediately after preparation (time 0), every 24 h (at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, etc.) for the first 14 days, and every 1 to 5 days thereafter until day 30.
Each sample was analyzed by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography.
A solution was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial concentration.


RESULTS
The most common barrier was failure to notify the pharmacist about impending patient discharge (130/313 [41%]).
Time constraints existed for 130 (32%) of the patients, the most common related to clarification of prescriptions (96 [24%]), creation of a medication list (69 [17%]), and faxing of prescriptions (64 [16%]).


RESULTS
Charts for 100 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were reviewed.
The mean age was 69.0 years (standard deviation 18.7 years), and 56% were men.
The median interval from onset of severe sepsis or septic shock to administration of antibiotic was 4.00 h (interquartile range [IQR] 1.80-6.45 h).
The median interval from the time a physician ordered an antibiotic to administration of the drug was 1.28 h (IQR 0.57-3.05 h).
The overall survival rate was 56%.


METHODS
An observational, prospective pilot study was conducted over 3 months.

RESULTS
After the didactic sections, both CPSAs answered all review questions correctly.
The accuracy of data collection (based on 60 patient encounters) was 98.3%.
The warfarin regimens recommended by the CPSAs were similar to those recommended by the clinical pharmacists, with doses differing by a mean of 0.46 mg.


RESULTS
Most of the 28 618 children aged 1 to 16 years injured during non-motorized wheeled activities were injured while cycling, followed by skateboarding.
Most injuries occurred among boys.
Children injured on scooters tended to be younger whereas skateboarders were the oldest.
On average, the number of all injuries decreased by 6% over the time period.
Falls were the most common mechanism of injury; 8.3% of patients had head injuries, which were seen more often among cyclists than other wheeled-activity users.
Helmet use was greatest among cyclists (62.2%) and lowest among skateboarders (32.9%).


CONCLUSION
However, disparities in coverage could lead to increased inequity in risk.
Simple modelling approaches can be used to examine the community effectiveness of individual preventive interventions and their potential to reduce (or increase) disparities.
The equity tipping point can be used as a critical threshold for disparities analyses.


RESULTS
First Nations and Métis adults were significantly more likely than non-Aboriginal adults to self-report smoking and/or to be classified as obese.
No significant differences across the 3 ethnocultural groups were found for breast and cervical screening among women or colorectal screening among men.


RESULTS
Between 2004 and 2008, the prevalence of daily SHS exposure in the home and cars decreased by 4.7% and 18.0% respectively.


RESULTS
About 43% of those with dementia did not live with their primary caregiver.
Depressive symptoms were relatively common in the dementia and other neurological groups.


RESULTS
The most effective knowledge exchange included tailored products and opportunities for dialogue and action planning.
Evaluation is the least developed KDE component.
Building KDE capacity requires frequent dialogue, mutually beneficial partnerships and trust.
It also requires attention to language, vision, strategic leadership and funding.


METHODS
The OSCE comprised 6 10-minute stations, each testing 2 intrinsic roles using case-based scenarios (with or without the use of standardized patients).
Concurrent validity was sought by correlation with in-training evaluation reports (ITERs) from the last 12 months and an ordinal ranking created by program directors (PDs).

RESULTS
Twenty-five residents from postgraduate years (PGY) 0, 3 and 5 participated.
The interstation reliability for total test scores (percent) was 0.87, while reliability for each of the communicator, collaborator, manager and professional roles was greater than 0.8.
Total test scores, individual station scores and individual CanMEDS role scores all showed a significant effect by PGY level.
Analysis of the PD rankings of intrinsic roles demonstrated a high correlation with the OSCE role scores.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients who presented to our tertiary care pediatric emergency department with SCEF between January 2005 and December 2009.
We reviewed their charts to assess several clinical parameters, including age, sex, Gartland classification of SCEF, weight, comorbidities, treatment intervention, physiotherapy and the extremity involved.
The DASH questionnaire was administered in 2012.
We performed a multiple linear regression analysis to determine the significance of these clinical parameters as they related to the DASH score for functional outcome.

RESULTS
We included 94 patients with SCEF in our review.
Pediatric SCEF had good functional outcomes based on the DASH questionnaire (mean score 0.77 ± 2.10).
We obtained the following DASH scores: 0.45 ± 2.20 for type I, 1.09 ± 1.70 for type II and 1.43 ± 2.40 for type III fractures.
There was no statistical difference in functional outcome, regardless of sex (p = 0.07), age at injury (p = 0.96), fracture type (p = 0.14), weight (p = 0.59), right/left extremity (p = 0.26) or surgery (p = 0.52).


RESULTS
We enrolled 30 patients: 12 randomized to POP and 18 to SRF.
There was no difference in the number of casts required for clubfoot correction between the groups (p = 0.13).
According to parents, removal of POP was more difficult (p < 0.001), more time consuming (p < 0.001) and required more than 1 method (p < 0.001).


METHODS
Two radiologists independently reviewed CT scans from all patients admitted to hospital with SBO between 2004 and 2006.

RESULTS
There were 228 patients with SBO, 63 of whom met our inclusion criteria and had CT scans available for review.


CONCLUSION
Overall, the OITE was able to provide useful feedback to Canadian orthopedic surgery residents and their training programs in preparing them for their RCPSC examinations.
However, when these data were collected, truly normative data based on a Canadian sample were not available.


METHODS
We analyzed patients with proven appendicitis for the period January 2008 to December 2012.
Alvarado scores were retrospectively assigned based on patients' admission charts.

RESULTS
We studied 1000 patients (54% male, median age 21 yr).
Forty percent had inflamed, nonperforated appendices and 60% had perforated appendices.


RESULTS
There was no significant difference in baseline SF-36 scores between the groups.
The average change in PCS score was 10.4 versus 11.4 (p = 0.61) for the D and DF groups, respectively.
Sixty-seven percent of the D group and 71% of the DF group attained MCID, while 64% of both D and DF groups attained SCB.


RESULTS
They all had tumour-free surgical margins, and no further oncological operations were required.

CONCLUSION
It is oncologically beneficial and is associated with high patient satisfaction.


METHODS
We conducted a systematic search of 3 electronic journal databases of articles published between January 2000 and June 2010.

RESULTS
We screened 1201 abstracts, 72 of which were eligible for inclusion in our review.
Femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures were equally represented.
Thirty-three (46%) studies did not report the inclusion or exclusion of patients with cognitive impairment.
Nineteen (26%) studies explicitly included cognitively impaired patients, whereas 20 (28%) excluded them.
Only 2 trials (3%) reported outcomes specific to cognitively impaired patients.
Fourteen trials (19.4%) reported the use of a validated cognitive assessment tool.
None of the trials that reported inclusion of cognitively impaired patients were from North American centres.


METHODS
Health workers' knowledge of the recommendations was assessed before and after messaging and traditional training through a multiple choice questionnaire.
The percentage change in score in the control group was compared with that in the intervention group.
Changes in prescribing practices were also compared.

FINDINGS
In the control group, however, antibiotic and steroid prescriptions increased by 17 and 11 percentage points, respectively.


METHODS
In addition, the density of public clinics, alone and with community pharmacies, was calculated and compared with a national benchmark of one clinic per 10,000 residents.
Interviews were conducted with nine national experts from the pharmacy sector.

FINDINGS
Community pharmacies increased in number by 13% between 1994 and 2012--less than the 25% population growth.
In 2012, community pharmacy density was higher in urban provinces and was eight times higher in the least deprived districts than in the most deprived ones.
Maldistribution persisted despite the growth of corporate community pharmacies.
Experts expressed concerns that a lack of rural incentives, inappropriate licensing criteria and a shortage of pharmacy workers could undermine access to pharmaceutical services, especially in rural areas.


METHODS
This study involved villages that participated in a cluster randomized trial comparing the effect of one versus three azithromycin MDA rounds on the prevalence of trachoma.
Only villages in which most children received 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were included.
Pneumococcal carriage was assessed using nasopharyngeal swabs and azithromycin resistance was detected using the Etest.


FINDINGS
Of the 82 empirical costing and efficiency studies identified, nine provided data on economies of scale.
Scale explained much of the variation in the costs of several HIV services, particularly those of targeted HIV prevention for key populations and HIV testing and treatment.
There is some evidence of economies of scope from integrating HIV counselling and testing services with several other services.


RESULTS
Of the 172 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 36 experienced a complication.


RESULTS
From the original search, three randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis of preoperative antibiotics.
The meta-analysis revealed a 75% reduction in wound infections with preoperative antibiotics (OR 0.25 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.72]).
Because only one randomized controlled trial analyzed postoperative antibiotics, no meta-analysis could be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
Preoperative antibiotics should routinely be used before breast reduction surgery.
The use of postoperative antibiotics remains controversial.


RESULTS
Over the 25-year period, 356 studies investigated the use of SSD in burns, while 55 studies evaluated the use of NCS.
Mean age and burn size were equivalent.
Dressings were performed twice per week for NCS, and once or twice per day for SSD.
The mean total cost per patient to the health care system was estimated to be $61,140 for SSD and $17,220 for NCS.

CONCLUSION
Overall health care value is optimized using NCS for pediatric scalds.


RESULTS
The weight of the specimens received ranged from 0.2 g to 1147.2 g.
The literature review identified a total of 15 incidental findings: ductal carcinoma in situ (12 cases), atypical ductal hyperplasia (two cases) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma (one case).


RESULTS
Seventeen patients underwent major upper extremity replantation surgery.
The majority (16 of 17 [94%]) of the included patients were male.
Of 17 patients, 13 (76.5%) required reoperations.
On the MHQ, the mean score for affected hand function was 16% compared with 84% in the unaffected hand.


RESULTS
The most common use of the PHDPE graft was for septal extension (n=80 [42.6%]) and spreader graft (n=58 [30.9%]).
Complications were reported in six cases (4.0% [five cases of extrusion and one case of infection]).


RESULTS
All patients presented with progressive unilateral breast enlargement with at least a doubling of their breast size.

CONCLUSIONS
Late hematomas presented from nine to 38 years after submuscular breast augmentation with a doubling of breast size.
Late hematomas appeared to result from multiple recurrent bouts of bleeding within the structure of the capsules.
Breast enlargement develops progressively over time rather than acutely.
Continuing acute hemorrhage persisted up to one year after initial hematoma development.
This progression suggests a process analogous to a chronic expanding hematoma that has been described in other areas of the body.


RESULTS
The symmetry of the reconstructed ears was satisfactory and the cosmetic appearance was acceptable for 13 patients.
No additional complications were encountered.


RESULTS
In 2010, 40,240 estimated procedures were performed.
A total of 263 (0.007%) complications were reported.
Sixteen (0.0004%) patients required reoperations in hospital and 19 (0.0004%) patients required transfer to hospital on the day of surgery.
There were only two mortalities within 30 days of surgery reported in the past five years.


FINDINGS
In 56% (62/111) of the samples, it exceeded the Bangladeshi threshold of 50 µg/l; the mean concentration being 54.5 µg/l (range: 0.1-93.1).
When validated against laboratory values, the EQ kit correctly identified arsenic contamination relative to the guideline in 95% (106/111) of groundwater and in 68% (19/28) of surface water samples.

CONCLUSION
This poses a public health threat requiring further investigation and action.


FINDINGS
Of the 40,423 eligible subjects, 37,417 (92.6%) participated in the survey; 103 smear-positive cases and 211 smear-negative, culture-positive cases were identified.
The weighted prevalences of smear-positive tuberculosis and bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 271 (95% confidence interval, CI: 212-348) and 831 (95% CI: 707-977) per 100,000 population, respectively.
Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in men than women and increased with age.
A 38% decline in smear-positive tuberculosis (P = 0.0085) was observed with respect to the 2002 survey, after participants were matched by demographic and geographical characteristics.
The prevalence of symptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by 56% (P = 0.001), whereas the prevalence of asymptomatic, smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by only 7% (P = 0.7249).


METHODS
Varicella vaccination coverage for children born between 2001 and 2009 was obtained from the Australian Childhood Immunization Register.
Trends in hospitalization rates in different age groups and indigenous status were assessed.
Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated between periods before and after implementation of immunization programme funding.

FINDINGS
In the first year of the funded immunization programme, varicella vaccine coverage reached 75% in children aged 24 months and more than 80% in children aged 60 months.
The age-standardized HZ hospitalization rate declined between the periods (IRR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.92-0.97).


FINDINGS
Between 2010 and 2012, 214,070 of 220,235 enrolled women (97.2%) completed follow-up.

CONCLUSION
Maternal death increased the risk of perinatal and neonatal death.


RESULTS
Of the three professions examined, 73% of chiropractors adhered to current clinical practice guidelines, followed by physiotherapists (62%) and then medical practitioners (52%).


RESULTS
Seventy-six of ninety contacted patients participated in this study.

CONCLUSION
The screening of patients for cardiac arrhythmias in a community based chiropractic clinic is feasible.


RESULTS
Five articles met the inclusion criteria of this review.
Two studies had a low risk of bias, and three had a low concern regarding applicability.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A 54 year old man presented with chronic neck pain without headache.
A clinical examination was performed and the chiropractor viewed his AP and lateral radiographs.
Previous flexion/ extension radiographs and MRI imaging from 2009 were requested for review.
The patient was diagnosed with grade II mechanical neck pain.
Treatment was rendered that day which included spinal manipulation/ mobilization.
Several days later the requested imaging reports were received and described the presence of an os odontoideum.

CONCLUSION
In the presence of os odontoideum, familiarity with the signs and symptoms of potential cervical instability is imperative.
Health care providers must remain diligent in their patient histories, physical exams, and imaging.


RESULTS
The average pressure pain thresholds were 14.92 (±6.03), 15.07(±6.07), 11.10 (±6.68) for the left and right tibia and sternum, respectively.
The stability between the measurements was very high with the interclass correlation coefficient (95% CI) calculated as 0.94 (0.62-1.00), 0.9 (0.81-1.00), 0.96(0.93-1.00).
The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.03 for the left tibia, 0.17 for the right tibia and 0.20 for the sternum, J Dresser, M MacIntyre, B Chisholm, GE Lawson showing a negligible correlation for the left and right tibia, but a low positive correlation for the sternum.


METHODS
Vaccination rates and other descriptive statistics were calculated and compared with data for a 3-year period before implementation of the program.


METHODS
A total of 318 surveys were sent to 96 pharmacies.
Data analysis was based on descriptive statistics, including frequencies, ranges, and measures of central tendency.

RESULTS
Fifty-one completed surveys were returned (response rate 16%).
Thirty-five (69%) of the responding pharmacists were not aware or were unsure that a patient from the Kidney Care Clinic was a client of their pharmacy.
Clinical information ranked most useful included an updated medication list with indications and details regarding recent medication changes.


METHODS
Dexamethasone suspensions (1 mg/mL) were prepared in Oral Mix and Oral Mix SF and then transferred to amber glass and plastic prescription bottles and plastic oral syringes.
The samples were analyzed by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method.
A suspension was considered stable if it maintained at least 90% of its initial dexamethasone concentration.
Changes in colour, taste, odour, precipitation (and ease of resuspension), and pH were used to assess physical compatibility.


RESULTS
Groups of 31 and 50 patients underwent TKA with the 2 systems, respectively.
The number of radiographic outliers also significantly differed.
A significantly higher proportion (32%; p < 0.01) of patients in the second cohort exhibited unacceptable malalignment compared with the first cohort (24%).

CONCLUSION
Navigation systems for TKA continue to increase in sophistication and popularity.


METHODS
Radical liver resections were compared with other types of procedures.
Clinical presentation, investigations, perioperative outcomes and longterm follow-up were evaluated.
We evaluated disease recurrence using the Kaplan- Meier method.

RESULTS
Forty patients underwent surgery for hydatid liver cysts.
Most patients had single (68%) right-sided (46%) cysts with a median size of 10 cm.
Most (83%) underwent liver resection with or without drainage/marsupialization.
Radical liver resection was carried out in 60% (19 major, 5 minor).
Additional procedures were required in 50% (biliary fistulization 30%, diaphragmatic fistulization 20% or paracaval location/ fusion 8%).
Postoperative complications occurred in 48%.
The median follow-up was 39 months.


RESULTS
A total of 327 patients were managed with an SHS device (252 women, 75 men).
There were 208 stable fracture patterns (AO/OTA 31 A1, A2.1) and 119 unstable (AO/OTA 31 A2.2, A2.3, A3).
We managed 172 patients with 2-hole plates and 155 with 4-hole plates.
There was no significant difference in length of stay (19 v. 16 d).


RESULTS
The study included 81 patients.
The average duration of surgery was 220.0 (range 206-233) minutes.
The major complication rate was 3.6% ± 4.2% and the average nodal yield was 31.3 ± 4.1.

CONCLUSION
Operative duration is nearly triple that reported for conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.


RESULTS
We enrolled 274 patients in our study.
The number of patients presenting with obstructive jaundice was higher in groups 2 (83.6%) and 3 (83.3%) than group 1 (66%).
Cholangitis was more common in group 1 (21.3%) than in groups 2 (6.7%) and 3 (2.3%).
The presence of biliary stone disease among patients presenting with pancreatitis was significantly different between groups 1 and 3 (p = 0.013) and between groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.017).


RESULTS
A total of 835 patients had fixation of their hip fractures during the study period; 631 met the inclusion criteria and 249 of them (39.5%) were transfused.
We found an association between need for blood transfusion and female sex (p = 0.018), lower preoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.001), fracture type (p < 0.001) and fixation method (p < 0.001).
Compared with femoral neck fractures, there was a 2.37 times greater risk of blood transfusion in patients with intertrochanteric fractures (p < 0.001) and a 4.03 times greater risk in those with subtrochanteric fractures (p < 0.001).
Dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation decreased the risk of transfusion by about half compared with intramedullary nail or hemiarthroplasty.
We found no association with age, delay to operation (p = 0.17) or duration of surgery (p = 0.30).


METHODS
Our analysis was adjusted for tumour site, type of resection, surgical training and pathologic stage.

RESULTS
A total of 1279 of 1356 (94%) enrolled patients had nodal data available for analysis; 161 (13%) patients had emergency surgery and 1118 (87%) had elective surgery.
The mean number of nodes removed was higher in the emergency surgery group (mean difference +2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-5.1, p = 0.012).
The proportion of patients with inadequate nodal staging did not differ between groups (emergent 16%, elective 17%, p = 0.79).


RESULTS
Scientific and medical evidence clearly indicate that HIV is difficult to transmit during sex.


INTRODUCTION
This young adult population is more frequently exposed to vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.

RESULTS
Among the 677 students approached, 583 agreed to participate.
Only 207 (36%) of respondents knew the recommended dosing interval between two doses of tetanus vaccine booster (10 years).
The majority of students (69%) reported having up-to-date vaccinations.
Declaring having up-to-date vaccinations was significantly associated with having a general practitioner (OR 3.03 [95% CI 1.69 to 5.55]).
Health care students were significantly more likely to know the decennial interval between two antitetanus boosters (OR 2 [95% CI 1.28 to 3.25]).
Most of responding students (n=519 [89%]) believed that vaccines were very useful.


RESULTS
No patients were found to have empyema caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

CONCLUSIONS
This approach could help clinicians provide targeted antimicrobial therapy.


RESULTS
All isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline, clarithromycin, levofloxacin and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.
One isolate was intermediately resistant to cefuroxime, representing a 99.15% sensitivity rate to the cephem agent.


RESULTS
Most patients were BC residents and were assessed by the multidisciplinary team at the BC clinic.
The most common comorbidities were anxiety and mood disorders (n=4), and hemophilia (n=4).
Of the patients eligible for transplantation, four were transplanted for autoimmune hepatitis (5.67 years post-transplant), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (2.33 years), hepatitis C virus (2.25 years) and hepatitis B-delta virus coinfection (recent transplant).
One patient died from acute renal failure while waiting for transplantation.
Ten patients died during preassessment and 10 were unsuitable transplant candidates.
The most common reason for unsuitability was stable disease not requiring transplantation (n=4).


RESULTS
In conjugation experiments, PMQR genes were successfully transferred from seven (8.6%) isolates.


RESULTS
Ten patients who presented or copresented with CA necrotizing pneumonia secondary to CA-MRSA from April 2004 to October 2011 were identified.
The median length of stay was 22.5 days.
Mortality was 20.0%.
Classical risk factors for CA-MRSA were identified in seven of 10 (70.0%) cases.
Chest tube placement occurred in seven of 10 patients with empyema.
None of the patients had historical evidence of antecedent URI.
In eight of 10 patients, serological or nucleic acid testing testing revealed no evidence of acute viral coinfection.
Eight strains were CMRSA-10 (USA300).
The remaining two strains were a USA300 genetically related strain and a USA1100 strain.

CONCLUSION
Pneumonia secondary to CA-MRSA can occur in the absence of an antecedent URI.
Infections due to CA-MRSA are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.


RESULTS
Responses in 92 completed questionnaires were analyzed.
The mean age of respondents was 32 years and all were HIV negative.
Twelve percent of patients reported having at least one risk factor for HIV transmission.
Regardless of willingness to be tested, the most frequently cited barriers to testing were social stigma (64%) and reaction from partners (69%).


RESULTS
False-positive results were also observed with assays targeting the ptx-promoter and pertactin genes.
A PCR assay based on the thialase gene was highly specific but failed to detect all reference strains of B pertussis.
According to Probit regression analysis, the 95% detection limit of the new assay was 4 colony forming units/reaction.


METHODS
We convened, via teleconference, a semistructured focus group with the local midwives and students.

RESULTS
Four midwives and 6 students took part in the focus group, representing 80% of local midwives and students.
All of the participants were women, and their professional experience ranged from 3 to 25 years.
Midwives believed that the health of women and infants could be improved through better food selection, particularly reliance on traditional nutrient-rich food.
They were aware that iron deficiency was a problem and that infants required vitamin D; however, they reported that supplement uptake was poor.


RESULTS
The one-year period prevalence of combination therapy and switching among 9,431 children and adolescents with ADHD treated with stimulants was 19.8% and 18.7%, respectively.
The most frequent combination categories were atypical antipsychotics (AAP: 10.8%), atomoxetine (ATX: 5.5%) and clonidine (5.3%).
The most frequent switched-to categories were other stimulants (7.9%), AAP (5.5%) and ATX (4.7%).


RESULTS
All articles addressed youth suicide generally rather than reporting exclusively on a specific death by suicide.
Alignment of articles with individual WHO guideline items ranged from 16 to 60%.
The most common content theme was prevention (80%).
No article was judged to glamorize suicide.
Help seeking was addressed in 52% of articles, but only 20% provided information on where to obtain help.
Statistics were referenced more frequently than scientific research (76% vs. 28%).


OBJECTIVES
Youth homelessness is on the rise in North America, yet this vulnerable population is rarely studied and compared with adults.
It also aimed to describe the youth homeless population and their significant co-morbidities.

RESULTS
Youth constituted 16.5% (n=82) of the homeless population.
A lower prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (0.2%) and psychotic disorders (13.4%) was also observed.


OBJECTIVE
Despite limited information related to efficacy in children, psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed as a first-line treatment for a range of psychiatric diagnoses in children in a variety of clinical settings.
Usage has increased over the past three decades.
The current research seeks to identify the mental health characteristics of those children at highest risk of experiencing potential AE from psychotropic medications.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study indicate that the number of potential AE from psychotropic medications may be predictable based on client characteristics.


RESULTS
The response rate was 50% and respondents reflected the demographic characteristics of FPs nationwide as per the National Physician Survey.
Knowledge testing revealed reasonable mean (± SD) scores (3.2±1.03 of 5).
Twenty percent of respondents would always perform an excisional biopsy of skin lesions suspicious for melanoma.


RESULTS
Thirty-eight families of children with OBPI completed the IoFS.


DESCRIPTION
The authors present the Figure 8 sternal fixation device to minimize these complications.
Biomechanical properties of the device were compared with conventional steel wire sternal repair.

EVALUATION
Samples were tested to 500,000 cycles or failure.
FlatWires were found to have superior biomechanical properties in all categories tested.


RESULTS
The mean midpoint distance for the index finger was 2.96 mm (95% CI 2.71 mm to 3.21 mm).
The mean angle of offset was 20.09° (95% CI 15.54° to 24.64°).
The mean graft offset distance was prominent by 1.23 mm (95% CI 0.57 mm to 1.89 mm).
The offset distances for digits 3 and 5 were 1.24 mm (95% CI 0.48 mm to 2.00 mm) and 1.08 mm (95% CI 0.48 mm to 1.68 mm), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
In this model, the hamate graft must be offset to recreate the curvature of the middle phalanx.


RESULTS
A total of 5815 patients underwent CABG during the study period.
Factors predictive of sternal wound dehiscence were diabetes (OR 2.97 [95% CI 1.73 to 5.10]), obesity (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.05 to 2.27]) and female sex (OR 1.90 [95% CI 1.26 to 2.87]).


RESULTS
Analysis of actual doses and pharmacokinetically predicted doses required to reach target levels suggested increasing the empirical dosing for all neonatal age groups.

CONCLUSIONS
This regimen requires clinical validation in an independent cohort in the future.


RESULTS
Forty percent were adolescents.
Overall, participants reported good adherence at home and school, but lower adherence at social events.
Adolescents reported lower adherence compared with parents.
Availability of GF foods and cost were the most significant barriers.


RESULTS
The response rate was 24% (586 of 2490).
Fifty-three percent of respondents practiced general paediatrics exclusively and 52% reported that they administer vaccines.


RESULTS
Analysis of actual doses and pharmacokinetically predicted doses required to reach target levels suggested increasing the empirical dosing for all neonatal age groups.

CONCLUSIONS
This regimen requires clinical validation in an independent cohort in the future.


RESULTS
The sampled students included 327 obese/overweight students and 1078 students with normal body mass index (BMI).
The crude OR of obesity/overweight for boys compared with girls was 1.57 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.01).


RESULTS
The plans were divided between symptom-based (59%) and combined symptom- and peak-flow rate approaches (41%).
Nominal concordance with the 2012 Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines existed with respect to inhaled corticosteroid and oral corticosteroid therapy.


RESULTS
Sixty-seven of 121 (55%) of the responding non-CPSN facilities reported that they see children <18 years of age.
Thirty-six of 121 (30%) and 23 of 121 (19%), respectively, see children ≤12 years of age or ≤8 years of age.
Alberta has the smallest ratio of children to practitioners (approximately 167,000 to 1) and Ontario has the smallest ratio of children to polysomnograms performed per year (approximately 487,000 to 1).
Reported wait times for polysomnography ranged from <1 month, to 1.5 to 2 years.
In paediatric tertiary care centres, the number of polysomnograms performed per year ranged from 55 to 700 (median 480) and in other laboratories the range was 400 to 4000 (median 1100).


OBJECTIVES
Simulation has not been previously studied in this context.

CONCLUSION
These findings may have applications and relevance for management of other acute or chronic medical conditions.


RESULTS
The sampled students included 327 obese/overweight students and 1078 students with normal body mass index (BMI).
The crude OR of obesity/overweight for boys compared with girls was 1.57 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.01).


RESULTS
From July 4 to September 22, 2011, a total of 721 patients were admitted to the study unit, of whom 381 (53%) were classified as opioid-naive.
Opioids were prescribed for 82 (22%) of these opioid-naive patients while they were in hospital.
Among the opioid-naive patients, there were a total of 247 opioid prescriptions, with hydromorphone (110 prescriptions) and morphine (92 prescriptions) being the drugs most commonly prescribed.
The indication for opioids was documented in 16 (70%) of the 23 discharge prescriptions.
No adverse events or deaths related to opioid use were identified during the hospital stays.


METHODS
Two coders used NVivo software to classify the content of posts.

RESULTS
Overall, 129 people (52.9% of the 244 listserv members registered at the end of the calendar year) posted to the listserv during the study period.


OBJECTIVES
The secondary objective was to determine factors associated with this dosage change.

RESULTS
A total of 166 eligible patients were identified.
For all of these patients, nimodipine 60 mg every 4 h was prescribed initially.


CONCLUSIONS
The results of the present study suggest the involvement of oxidative stress in HIV infection, with the participation of NN synthesis.


RESULTS
Approximately 20% of patients achieved steady-state concentrations <1 μg/mL.
Voriconazole concentrations were correlated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels at day 6 to 8, and with higher bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase levels at day 14 to 16, but not with other liver enzyme levels.

CONCLUSION
The findings support the routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring in these patients.


RESULTS
Among 32 children and young adults with IM, the median age was 16 years (range two to 24 years).

CONCLUSION
This entity is not necessarily a marker of disease severity.


METHODS
Two health districts in the Sahel region eliminated user fees for facility deliveries and curative consultations for children in September 2008.
To compare health-care coverage before and after this change, we used interrupted time series, propensity scores and three independent data sources.
We modelled the mortality impact of coverage changes in the Lives Saved Tool using several scenarios.

FINDINGS
Coverage increased for all variables, however, the increase was not statistically significant for antibiotics for pneumonia.
Maternal mortality showed a modest decrease in all scenarios.


FINDINGS
Health status was the factor most strongly correlated with both experienced and evaluative well-being, even after controlling for a history of depression, age, income and other sociodemographic variables.


METHODS
TEASE-16 was applied to policy data from nine study areas in the western Pacific: Australia, China excluding Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Viet Nam.
Correlation and regression analyses were then used to examine the relationship between alcohol policy scores and income-adjusted levels of alcohol consumption per capita.

FINDINGS
Vast differences exist in how alcohol control policies are implemented in the western Pacific.
Study areas with high policy scores - indicating relatively strong alcohol policy frameworks - had lower alcohol consumption per capita.
Sensitivity analyses indicated scores and rankings for each study area remained relatively stable across different weighting schemes, indicating that TEASE-16 was robust.


FINDINGS
We found that mortality decreased only modestly each year (mortality rate ratio: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.95-1.00; P = 0.093).
The proportion of households with orphans under the age of 16 years decreased from 17% in 2004 to 7% in 2011.
The proportions of respondents who had ever been tested for HIV, had a comprehensive knowledge of HIV, knew where to obtain free ART and reported that a non-pregnant household member was receiving ART gradually increased.

CONCLUSION
The expansion of ART services in Lusaka was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality.


FINDINGS
In each year between 2007 and 2011, there were 6.9-19.6 (mean: 10.8) notified cases of measles per million population.
Incidence decreased with age and showed geographical variation, with highest mean incidence - 20.3 cases per million - in southern Germany.
Over the study period, incidence decreased by 10% (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 0.90; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.85-0.95) per year in western Germany but increased by 77% (IRR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.62-1.93) per year in eastern Germany.
Although the estimated incidence of measles based on insurance claims showed similar trends, these estimates were 2.0- to 4.8-fold higher than the incidence of notified cases.
Comparisons between the data sets indicated that the underreporting increased with age and was generally less in years when measles incidence was high than in low-incidence years.

CONCLUSION
Germany is still far from achieving measles elimination.
Our analysis indicates underreporting in the routine surveillance system between 2007 and 2011, especially among adults.


METHODS
The effect on prevalence of maternal age, parity and birth before or after HBV vaccine availability in 1984 was assessed, using Spearman's correlation and multiple logistic regression analysis.

FINDINGS
Overall, 7.5% of women were HBsAg-positive.
The prevalence ranged from 2.3% to 8.4% in those aged ≤ 16 and 23 years, respectively.


FINDINGS
Between 1920-2012, the highest per capita asbestos use was found in the no-ban group.
After 2000, early-ban and late-ban groups reduced their asbestos use levels to less than or equal to 0.1 kg/capita/year, respectively, while the no-ban group maintained a very high use at 2.2 kg/capita/year.
Between 1994 and 2010, the European Region registered 106,180 deaths from mesothelioma and asbestosis, accounting for 60% of such deaths worldwide.
In the early-ban and late-ban groups, 16/17 and 15/17 countries, respectively, reported mesothelioma data to WHO, while only 6/19 countries in the no-ban group reported such data.
The age-adjusted mortality rates for mesothelioma for the early-ban, late-ban and no-ban groups were 9.4, 3.7 and 3.2 deaths/million persons/year, respectively.
Asbestosis rates for the groups were 0.8, 0.9 and 1.5 deaths/million persons/year, respectively.

CONCLUSION
Within the European Region, the early-ban countries reported most of the current asbestos-related deaths.


METHODS
We conducted a nationally representative survey of people with sputum-smear-positive tuberculosis between 2010 and 2011.

FINDINGS
Overall, M. tuberculosis was isolated from 1777 (83.8%) of the 2120 smear-positive tuberculosis patients.
Although resistance to second-line drugs was found, no cases of extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis were detected.


FINDINGS
The screened studies had been published between 1983 and 2013 and their results had been reported in English (n = 124), Portuguese (n = 25) or Spanish (n = 50).
Only 29 of the studies met our inclusion criteria.
Most of the selected studies reported substantial misdiagnosis of causes of death in hospitals.
There was wide variation in study methodologies.
Many studies did not describe the methods used in sufficient detail to be able to assess the reproducibility or comparability of their results.

CONCLUSION
The assumption that causes of death are being accurately reported in hospitals is unfounded.


METHODS
Information on pharmaceutical policy changes between 2008 and 2011 in eight European countries was obtained from publications and pharmaceutical policy databases.
We compared these indicators in economically stable countries; Austria, Estonia and Finland, to those in economically less stable countries, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain.

FINDINGS
Economically stable countries implemented two to seven policy changes each, whereas less stable countries implemented 10 to 22 each.
Sales volumes increased moderately in all countries except Greece and Portugal, which experienced slight declines after 2009.
Sales values decreased in both groups of countries, but fell more in less stable countries.


METHODS
There were 10,696 respondents - 59.7% female - aged 18-25 years.

FINDINGS
Over half of the respondents reported at least one adverse childhood experience.
Having one adverse childhood experience increased the probability of having other adverse childhood experiences.
The number of adverse childhood experiences was positively correlated with subsequent reports of health-harming behaviours.
Modelling indicated that prevention of adverse childhood experiences would substantially reduce the occurrence of many health-harming behaviours within the study population.


METHODS
Sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of detection of aberrations in the incidence of HFM disease outbreaks were estimated by comparing automated detections to observations of public health staff.

FINDINGS
The response system had a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 95.0%.
The mean delay between the reporting of the first case of an outbreak and detection of that outbreak by the response system was 2.1 days.


RESULTS
A total of 1752 surveys were sent; 1235 were eligible and 459 (37.2%) responded to the survey.
Overall, 296 (69.5% [95% CI 65.2% to 74.0%]) PCPs agreed that minor paediatric fractures could be followed in a PCP office.
The most frequently reported barriers were lack of materials to replace immobilization (58.1%), PCP knowledge deficits (44.8%) and a perceived parental preference for an orthopedic surgeon (38.6%).


RESULTS
Inclusion criteria were met by 33,233 children (2637 [7.9%] females and 30,596 [92.1%] males).


RESULTS
The incidence of positional plagiocephaly was estimated to be 46.6%.

CONCLUSION
This could occur in the prenatal period by prenatal care providers or educators, or during the neonatal period by postpartum and public health nurses.


RESULTS
Little or no variation was observed in the use of antihypertensives.

CONCLUSION
It is therefore important to take the socioeconomic context into account when planning interventions to prevent CVDs and their consequences.


RESULTS
Prevalence of many risk factors was significantly different for Inuit, FN and Métis populations.


RESULTS
A total of 1642 Aboriginal respondents were matched to the same number of non-Aboriginal Caucasian respondents.
Overall, 38.9% (95% CI: 36.5%-41.3%) of Aboriginal respondents had two or more chronic conditions compared to 30.7% (95% CI: 28.9%-32.6%) of non-Aboriginal respondents.
Comparisons of LCA results revealed that three or four clusters provided the best fit to the data.


RESULTS
For 2011-2012, the QICDSS contained information on 7 995 963 Quebecers with an average age of 40.8 years.
Of these, 95.3% met at least one selection criterion allowing the application of case definitions for chronic disease surveillance.


RESULTS
Our final sample was n = 111 449.
Overall, 58% of respondents had made an HBC, with increased sports/exercise as the most important HBC in 29% of the sample, followed by improved eating habits (10%) and weight loss (7%).
Regression models accounted for only 6%-10% of the total variance.


RESULTS
Moderate agreement was found between the 2 data sources (survey and RAMQ data) in terms of the diagnosis of asthma (κ = 0.54 and κ = 0.60 depending on the definition used).
Specificity was high (93% and 96%), but sensitivity varied (50% and 65%).


RESULTS
Among current smokers, 30.5% currently use RYO cigarettes.


RESULTS
The survey was fully completed by 577 health care providers who treat paediatric concussion.
Of the respondents, 78% (95% CI 74% to 81%) reported diagnosing ≥5 concussions annually.
Physicians and nonphysicians equally recognized concussion (90% [95% CI 86% to 92%]; 85% [95% CI 77% to 90%], respectively).
Only 37% (95% CI 32% to 41%) of physicians correctly applied graduated return to play guidelines.
Return to learn recommendations were also insufficient: 53% (95% CI 49% to 58%) neglected to recommend school absence and 40% (95% CI (35% to 44%) did not recommend schoolwork accommodations.
Only 26% (95% CI 22% to 30%) of physicians reported regular use of concussion scoring scales.


RESULTS
Responses were received from 21 surgeons in 2005 and 61 in 2012, representing 43% and 98% of practicing paediatric surgeons in Canada, respectively.
Satisfaction levels were generally moderate to high in most areas during both years.
In academics, surgeons were more satisfied in 2012 with the amount of teaching they provided (1.8 versus 2.2; P=0.02), and clinical research they performed (2.5 versus 3.0; P=0.04).
In patient care, there was higher satisfaction with the ability to provide elective services without impediment (2.5 versus 3.0; P=0.02).
Over the seven-year period, surgeons increasingly preferred the Canadian health care system over that of the United States (1.7 versus 2.2; P=0.02).
In the 2012 survey, no differences in levels of satisfaction were found between male and female surgeons.

CONCLUSIONS
The Canadian health care system is preferred over that of the United States.


RESULTS
Residents were aware of the issue of abuse generally, but had received no specific information or training on IPV in orthopedics.
They did not view IPV screening or intervention as part of the orthopedic surgeon's role.
Residents' clinical experiences emphasized time management and surgical intervention by effectively "getting through clinic" and "dealing with the surgical problem."
Communication with patients about other health issues was minimal or nonexistent.

CONCLUSION
Orthopedic surgery residents are entering a career path where IPV is well documented.


METHODS
Appropriate responses to survey questions were defined a priori.

RESULTS
The survey was sent to 2143 general surgeons; of the 1312 respondents, 703 treat patients with rectal cancer.
Most surgeons responded appropriately to the questions regarding staging investigations (88%) and management of low rectal cancer (88%).
Surgeons with subspecialty training were significantly more likely to provide correct responses to all of the survey questions than other surgeons.
There was limited variation in responses according to geographic region.
Subspecialty-trained surgeons and recent graduates were more likely to answer all of the survey questions correctly than other surgeons.


RESULTS
In our study cohort of 241, both BRASS (p < 0.001) and replacement type (hip v. knee; p = 0.048) were predictive of LOS.
Higher BRASS was associated with older patients (p < 0.001), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p < 0.001) and longer LOS (p < 0.001).
We found a specificity of 83% for a BRASS greater than 8 and a hospital stay longer than 5 days and a specificity of 92% for a BRASS greater than 10.


RESULTS
No anastomotic leaks were observed.
No 30-day mortality occurred.


CONCLUSION
Despite these improvements, maintenance of technical skills among trauma surgeons has become an important issue.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed appendectomies performed between October 2003 and February 2012.

CONCLUSION
Our data confirm the theory of a statistical association between the presence of a fecalith and acute (nonperforated) appendicitis in adults.
There was also a significant association between the healthy appendix and asymptomatic fecaliths.
There was no correlation between a gangrenous/perforated appendix and the presence of a fecalith.
The fecalith is an incidental finding and not always the primary cause of acute (nonperforated) appendictis or gangrenous (perforated) appendicitis.
Further research on the topic is recommended.


METHODS
The wait list comprised patients referred for surgery between March 2008 and May 2013.


CONCLUSION
Future studies could help identify predictors of reoperation and strategies to optimize nutrition, rehabilitation and resource allocation.


METHODS
We included patients with olecranon fractures treated between September 2010 and August 2013 in our study.

CONCLUSION
Our TP for the treatment of olecranon fractures is safe and effective.
Less osteosynthetic material was used for TP construction, but stability was preserved.


RESULTS
A total of 290 visits (119 patients) to the pediatric vascular abnormality clinic were reviewed.
Anthropometric measures did not cross percentiles in children treated with propranolol.


RESULTS
A response rate of 74% was achieved.
Respondents worked an average of 65 h per week, of which 18% was devoted to their leadership role, 59% clinically and the remainder on teaching and research.
A discrepancy existed between time spent on their leadership role (18%) and related compensation (10%).
Time management (47%) and managing conflict (24%) were described as the greatest leadership challenges by respondents.

CONCLUSIONS
Leadership and managerial skills are key core competencies, not only for trainees, but certainly for those in a position of leadership.


RESULTS
Of 68,118 patients with scapular fractures, brachial plexus injury was present in 1173 (1.72%).
Of the 426 injuries with detailed information on nerve injury, 208 (49%) involved the radial nerve, 113 (26.5%) the ulnar nerve, 65 (15%) the median nerve, 36 (8.5%) the axillary nerve and four (1%) the musculocutaneous nerve.

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of brachial plexus injuries in patients with scapular fractures was 1.72%.


RESULTS
Thirty-seven patients were enrolled.
Cicatricial alopecia was caused by burns (n=8), trauma (n=21) and plastic surgery (cleft lip and palate repair [n=8]).
Burn patients had a significantly larger bald area than the other patients (P<0.01).
The lowest S/T area was 82.81%.
The S/T index was significantly and inversely correlated with operative time.
Regarding long-term complications, two patients had postoperative epidermoid cysts that healed with local treatment.

CONCLUSION
It is relatively safe and yields satisfactory postoperative results.
Extending the results of the present study to Chinese clinical practice is warranted.


RESULTS
Follow-up data of a minimum of five months (mean follow-up 87 weeks) were available for 13 patients.


RESULTS
A total of 867 patients completed the PSQ, 489 of whom with isolated CL/P met inclusion criteria.
The mean age was 8.4 years.
The overall incidence of positive screening was 14.7%.
The most commonly reported symptoms among positive screeners were 'fidgets with hands or feet' (73.6%), 'interrupts others' (69.4%) and 'mouth breather during the day' (69.4%).
Sex, body mass index, ancestry and cleft type were not significantly associated with increased risk for positive screening.

CONCLUSION
This finding highlights the potential importance of routine screening in this at-risk group.


METHODS
Median turnaround times were analyzed with SPSS software using the Mann-Whitney U test.

RESULTS
In total, 304 and 244 medication orders were audited before and after DST implementation, respectively.
Antibiotics were also processed significantly faster (1 h 51 min versus 1 h 9 min, p = 0.015).


RESULTS
Overall, the proportion of patients who reached therapeutic trough levels with current empiric doses was 39% (74 of 188).


CONCLUSIONS
The rate of ADEs during hospital admissions was substantial.
These events may necessitate additional investigations and interventions and may prolong the hospital stay.


METHODS
This retrospective observational study involved patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital with diagnosis of a fall between January 1 and December 31, 2011.
Those aged 65 years or older with at least one PIM on admission were eligible for inclusion.
Data analysis included χ(2) and Fisher testing, as well as multivariate analysis.

RESULTS
The mean number (± standard deviation) of PIMs decreased during the hospital stay, from 1.6 ± 0.8 on admission to 1.4 ± 0.9 on discharge (p = 0.03).


RESULTS
A total number of 733 injuries were recorded.


RESULTS
The mean FMS score was 14.7+/-2.58.


INTRODUCTION
Their rate of use is not documented at the time of publication.

RESULTS
A total of 29 Canadian alpine ski racing coaches completed the study survey.


RESULTS
Primary outcome analysis involved within-groups comparisons.


RESULTS
Three randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review and were included in this review.
The outcomes used in these studies included Disability Indexes, Pain Scales and function improvement scales.
The third study found both interventions offering equal effects in the long term.

CONCLUSION
More studies are needed to further explore which intervention is more effective.


METHODS
Scientific Feasibility: Twelve subjects were randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group.
The intervention protocol consisted of intraoral vibration therapy on the muscles of mastication bilaterally for a period of 1 minute per muscle.
Process Feasibility: Several feasibility outcomes were examined including recruitment and retention rates and consent.

CONCLUSION
Scientific Feasibility: The scientific results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample sizes employed.
Process Feasibility: Recruitment and retention rates and ratios seem to support future studies.


METHODS
We considered the use of tabletop and portable, hand-held pulse oximeters among patients of any age undergoing major surgery in low-income countries.
From earlier studies we obtained baseline mortality and the effectiveness of pulse oximeters to reduce mortality.
We considered the direct costs of purchasing and maintaining pulse oximeters as well as the cost of supplementary oxygen used to treat hypoxic episodes identified by oximetry.
Health benefits were measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and benefits and costs were both discounted at 3% per year.
We used recommended cost-effectiveness thresholds--both absolute and relative to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita--to assess if pulse oximetry is a cost-effective health intervention.
To test the robustness of our results we performed sensitivity analyses.


FINDINGS
The overall risk of bias in the 23 included studies was low to moderate.
Internal travel restrictions and international border restrictions delayed the spread of influenza epidemics by one week and two months, respectively.
International travel restrictions delayed the spread and peak of epidemics by periods varying between a few days and four months.
Travel restrictions reduced the incidence of new cases by less than 3%.
Impact was reduced when restrictions were implemented more than six weeks after the notification of epidemics or when the level of transmissibility was high.
Travel restrictions would have minimal impact in urban centres with dense populations and travel networks.
We found no evidence that travel restrictions would contain influenza within a defined geographical area.


FINDINGS
A total of 33 documents were included in the analysis.
One country, Viet Nam, incorporates oral cholera vaccination into its public health programme and has administered approximately 10.9 million vaccine doses between 1997 and 2012.
These campaigns have either been pre-emptive or reactive and have taken place under diverse conditions, such as in refugee camps or natural disasters.
Estimated two-dose coverage ranged from 46 to 88% of the target population.
Approximate delivery cost per fully immunized person ranged from 0.11-3.99 United States dollars.


RELEVANT CHANGES
Between 2005 and 2013, 5514 HIV-positive patients were treated at the clinic.
Solutions to these problems were devised.
The collaborations encouraged local physicians to start their own research projects to find possible solutions to problems at the clinic.


METHODS
We interviewed 39 key informants from donor agencies, central government and nongovernmental organizations in Accra.
These respondents were purposively selected to provide local and international views from the three types of institutions.

CONCLUSION
In 1995-2012, the country's central government and donors responded to donor proliferation in health-sector aid by promoting harmonization and alignment.
This response was motivated by Ghana's need for foreign aid, constraints on the capacity of governmental human resources and inefficiencies created by donor proliferation.
Although this decreased the government's transaction costs, it also increased the donors' coordination costs and reduced the government's negotiation options.
Harmonization and alignment measures may have prompted donors to return to stand-alone projects to increase accountability and identification with beneficial impacts of projects.


APPROACH
The national reference laboratory introduced a national external quality assessment scheme.


APPROACH
In 2010, a programme that integrated and standardized prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) efforts for HIV, syphilis and HBV was implemented in 1156 counties.

LOCAL SETTING
In 2009, the rate of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV was 8.1% (57/702).
Reported congenital syphilis was 60.8 per 100,000 live births.
HBV infection was 7.2% of the overall population infected.


RESULTS
A total of 61 patients experienced 64 eligible hospitalizations.
The mean length of stay was 326 days, corresponding to a cumulative 20,892 hospital days (57.2 patient-years).
Sixteen (26%) patients in the study group died, and 16 (26%) were placed in long-term care or out-of-home care at the end of their long hospitalization.
Of children displaced from their family home, 14 (88%) were Aboriginal.


RESULTS
A total of 657 families were approached, of which 543 were enrolled (82.6% response rate).


RESULTS
The number of children evaluated in both EDs and a physician offices increased between 2003 and 2010, and this linear trend was statistically significant (P=0.002 for ED visits and P=0.001 for office visits).
The rate per 100,000 increased from 466.7 to 754.3 for boys and from 208.6 to 440.7 for girls during the study period.
Falls accounted for approximately one-third of the paediatric concussions.


RESULTS
Micafungin had similar overall success to caspofungin (60.4% [29 of 48] versus 57.3% [47 of 82], respectively; P=0.729).
Survival was higher in the micafungin group compared with the caspofungin group (100% [48 of 48] versus 89% [73 of 82]; P=0.02).

CONCLUSION
Verification of these results in a prospective trial is warranted.


RESULTS
Of the 29,260 records analyzed, 10% were multiple samples from single patients submitted on the same day, of which 98% had the same result.
Three percent of all parasite tests were positive, with the most prevalent parasites being (in ascending order) Dientamoeba fragilis, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium species and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar.
Age and sex were found to be weak risk factors, while rural living was found to be a moderate risk factor for D fragilis, G lamblia and Cryptosporidium infections.
The strongest risk factor was travel history, especially for nonendemic parasites.
The retrospective analysis of six alternative protocols identified four that may be more efficient than current procedures.


RESULTS
All HIV-HCV coinfected individuals should be assessed for HCV therapy.


Diagnosis
of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases Reference Centers (CDTMR) or Integrated Health Centers (CSI) using a pretested and structured questionnaire.
The median total delay was 46 days [inter-quartile interval (IQI) = 29-84 days].
Patient delay (median = 20; IQI = 8-47 days) was higher than health system delay (median=15; IIQ = 7-35 days).
Consulting first in the private sector or having 3 or more consultations before diagnosis was associated with health system delay.


RESULTS
We received 174 responses (27.2% response rate).
Numerous respondents were unaware of GP surgery (9.9% ± 4.5%) and ESS (17.9% ± 5.7%).
A quarter (25.1%) of respondents were considering ESS training.
The importance of ESS training opportunities and service was rated highly.

CONCLUSION
Many respondents were unaware of ESS as a career option.
Exposure to GP surgery during training was associated with increased awareness.
Furthermore, exposure fostered interest in this important field.


RESULTS
The overall response rate was 44 of 112 (39%): 17 of 58 (29%) EPs, 7 of 15 (47%) SMPs and 20 of 39 (51%) OS.
For suspected anterior cruciate ligament injuries, 13 (77%) EPs, 2 (29%) SMPs and 5 (25%) OS said they would immobilize (p = 0.005).
For lateral collateral ligament injuries, 9 (53%) EPs, no SMPs and 6 (32%) OS would immobilize (p = 0.04).
All respondents would prescribe immobilization for a grossly unstable knee.


RESULTS
We reviewed the cases of 281 patients, and augments were used in 24.


METHODS
Three orthopedic surgeons reviewed 80 lateral ankle radiographs.
Thirty of those radiographs were reviewed on a second occasion.
Rotation of the radiographs was determined by evaluating the overlap of the talar dome.
Four radiographic parameters were measured 1 cm above the tibial plafond: fibular width, tibial width, and anterior and posterior tibiofibular intervals.

RESULTS
Seventy-two radiographs were determined by consensus to be adequate.
Means and ratios were documented to determine the relationship of the fibula to the tibia.
Interrater reliability ranged from moderate to near-perfect, and the intrarater reliability was documented for each ratio.
The anterior tibiofibular ratio was shown to be strong to near-perfect.
It demonstrates that 40% of the tibia should be seen anterior to the fibula at 1cm above the tibial plafond.


RESULTS
Fifty LRHCs were completed during the study period: 21 IA and 29 EA.
The groups were similar in age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, previous laparotomy and preoperative invasive pathology.
There was 1 anastamotic leak in each group and no perioperative deaths.
Median length of stay was significantly shorter for IA (4 v. 5 d, p = 0.05).
There were 6 extraction site hernias with EA and none with IA (p = 0.026).


RESULTS
A total of 106 children were included in the present study.
Thirty-nine potential NHP-medication and 10 potential NHP-NHP interactions were identified.
A considerable number of patients (n=54) used at least one medication and NHP, or two NHPs with potential interactions.
The most common type of interaction was pharmacokinetic: decreasing blood concentrations of the medication, NHP or both (43.9% of NHP users); and enhancing the blood concentration of an NHP for NHP-NHP interactions (22% of NHP users).

CONCLUSION
A high proportion of patients in respite care use NHPs.
It is important to educate health care professionals about NHPs, the evidence available and lack thereof.
This could reduce the most serious interactions and improve the alliance between parents and health care providers to balance the potential risks and benefits of NHPs.


RESULTS
Fourteen of 18 (78%) residents completed the survey.
All residents preferred the 'systems-based' educational program.


OBJECTIVE
Current research provides minimal guidance on support, education and recommended evidence-based patient care.
This case reports the utilization of chiropractic spinal manipulation, dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS), and other adjunctive procedures along with medical treatment of PCA.

CONCLUSION
PCA is a progressive and debilitating condition.


RESULTS
The Study A group (n=31) maintained a significant reduction in the FFI at all three follow-up evaluations.
Mean improvement from baseline in FFI was 47%, 49% and 56% at 0, 1 and 6 months, respectively, post-treatment.
Mean PIS was 58%, 57%, and 58%, again at 0, 1 and 6 months post-treatment.
For the Study B group, mean improvement in FFI was only 19% after the monitoring period, and 64% after the experimental treatment period.
Mean PIS was 31% after monitoring, and 78% after experimental treatment.

CONCLUSION
Further validation of this treatment approach within a randomized controlled trial is needed.


RESULTS
The total number of patients was 38 in the baseline phase and 46 in the pilot period.
Completeness of transfer reconciliation was significantly higher during the pilot study than at baseline (91% [31/34] versus 61% [11/18], p = 0.022).
None of the 16 unintentional discrepancies were rated as causing severe patient discomfort or clinical deterioration.

CONCLUSIONS
Future studies should explore the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of this practice model.


METHODS
Commercially available dabigatran etexilate capsules (110 mg) were stored at room temperature (25°C) in the manufacturer's original blister pack, in unit-dose packaging, or in community pharmacy blister packs.
Samples were collected from each container daily for the first 3 days, weekly up to 28 days, every other week until day 98, and at day 120.
Suspensions were prepared, pH was evaluated, and samples were stored at -85°C until analysis.
Each sample was analyzed in duplicate by a validated, stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography - ultraviolet detection method.
The capsules were considered stable if they maintained at least 90% of the initial concentration.


RESULTS
The survey had 273 respondents.

CONCLUSION
Individuals and organizations seeking to expand their professional social media presence should focus on Twitter.


RESULTS
Risk factors for ED after PB were age, preimplant IIEF score and prostate volume.

BACKGROUND
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a metalloprotease with two isoforms.


RESULTS
507,019 cells were scored.


RESULTS
The fertilization rates were 57 and 55%, the embryo's cleavage rates were 90 and 93% in the antegrade ejaculation and SSR groups respectively.
Among the 8 couples who underwent ICSI, 5 couples achieved pregnancy.


METHODS
Sperm parameters and serum levels of total testosterone, FSH and inhibin B were measured prior to retrograde embolization (M0) and then 3 (M3) and 6 (M6) months afterwards.

RESULTS
The mean ± SD sperm progressive motility, vitality and percentage of normal sperm were respectively, 21.83 ± 16.48%, 61.88 ± 15.98% and 12.88 ± 7.15%.
The mean percentage of spermatozoa with a thin head was significantly lower at M6 (6.35 ± 5.29%) than at M0 (14.03 ± 13.09%).


RESULTS
MicroRNA expression was determined for 13 normal fertile men and 5 men with the confirmed diagnosis of diffuse SCO.


RESULTS
A total of 544 relevant statements from 189 respondents were included for the thematic content analysis.


FINDINGS
Donor survival is 100%.
The structure of the Canadian program is compared with that of other programs in the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States.


RESULTS
Among 44 HD patients, criteria for subclinical vitamin K deficiency were met in 13.6% (phylloquinone < 0.4 nmol/L), 51% (%ucOC > 20%) and 90.9% (PIVKA-II > 2.0 nmol/L) of subjects.
Phylloquinone levels were positively associated with total cholesterol, triglyceride levels and non-smoking status.
Higher %ucOC was associated with increased calcium-phosphate product.
PIVKA-II levels increased by 0.54 nmol/L for every 10-year increase in age.


RESULTS
Incremental annual costs for staffing, dialysis materials, and utilities were $8,201, $1,193, and $144, respectively.


FINDINGS
We highlight some successes and barriers to kidney research translation using recent examples of research in Canadian nephrology.


RESULTS
Among patients with a hemorrhage, 29.5% were prescribed warfarin in the preceding 120 days, and 8.4% clopidogrel.


FINDINGS
The use of generic immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) in transplantation is a controversial topic.
In this paper, we examine the various ethical issues involved such as distributive justice, physician duties, risks versus benefits, conflict of interest, informed consent, and logistical and economic issues.


IMPLICATIONS
Considerable work is required by ESRD Programs to ensure that such care is provided.


PARTICIPANTS
Nephrology fellows, internal medicine residents and medical students.
then had a training session that included a didactic presentation and 2 hours of deliberate practice using the simulator.
All participants were required to meet or exceed a minimum passing score (MPS) previously set at 79%.

RESULTS
Twenty-two individuals participated in SBML training.


RESULTS
This is likely attributed to gradual improving patient survival.
Between 2003 and 2012, nearly 90% of dialysis patients younger than <18 and 26% of patients 75+ years survived for at least five years.


METHODS
No discounting of future costs was applied.


RESULTS
CKD clinic structure and models of care vary significantly across Canada.
Large variation exists in staffing ratios (Nephrologist, dieticians, pharmacists and nurses to patients), and in referral criteria.
Targets for various modality choices varied, as did access to those modalities.


FINDINGS
CORR is the national registry of organ failure in Canada.
It has existed in some form since 1972 and currently houses data on patients with end-stage renal disease and solid organ transplants (kidney and/or non-kidney).
Coverage for transplant procedures is comprehensive and complete.
Long-term outcomes are tracked based on follow-up reports from participating transplant centres.
The longitudinal nature of CORR provides an opportunity to observe the trajectory of a patient's journey with organ failure over their life span.
Research studies conducted using CORR data inform both practitioners and health policy makers alike.


FINDINGS
There exists a common and robust approach in the G20 countries for approval and regulation of subsequent entry biologics.
Where SEBs are on the market, their market share is variable and modest.

IMPLICATIONS
At this time, they should not be automatically substitutable and only used for Health Canada-approved indications.
Only through good pharmacovigilence will health care providers and patients become better informed.


METHODS
Our systematic review follows the process outlined by Cochrane Reviews.

RESULTS
Ten studies involving three different epoetin SEBs (epoetin zeta, HX575 and epoetin theta) were included.
The mean epoetin dose used did not differ significantly between the SEBs and the reference product.
For epoetin zeta and epoetin theta, the mean hemoglobin levels achieved in the studies were similar between the SEBs and the reference epoetin.


METHODS
Renal function was evaluated by plasma creatinine levels.

RESULTS
The patients who presented with a higher RCIA in the first biopsy showed higher levels of plasma creatinine one year after transplantation (r = 0.44; p < 0.05).
There was also a positive correlation between the RCIA and the number of tubulointerstitial macrophages in the renal cortex of these patients (r = 0.49; p < 0.001).


OBJECTIVE
Observational case series study.


RESULTS
The incidence of AKI was 6.1% (Stage 1), 2.6% (Stage 2), and 5.8% (Stage 3).
Greater level of risk on the Cleveland tool was associated with a higher risk of Stage 3 AKI.

LIMITATIONS
Lack of prospective validation.


RESULTS
In 2000 to 2010, 51 HCV seroconversions were observed, an overall incidence of 5.1 per 1000 PY (95% CI 3.9 to 6.7).
Annual incidence varied from 1.6 to 8.9 per 1000 PY, with no statistical evidence of a temporal trend.
Risk for seroconversion was elevated among men who had ever had syphilis (adjusted HR 2.5 [95% CI 1.1 to 5.5) and men who had acute syphilis infection in the previous 18 months (adjusted HR 2.8 [95% CI 1.0 to 7.9]).
There were no statistically significant effects of age, ethnicity, region, CD4 cell count or HIV viral load.


RESULTS
The average annual direct cost of one HIV infection was $16,109 in the least expensive antiretroviral regimen scenario and $24,056 in the most expensive scenario.
The total indirect cost was $11,550 per year.
Total costs for the first year of HIV infection ranged from $27,410 to $35,358.
Undiscounted lifetime costs ranged from $1,439,984 ($662,295 discounted at 3% and $448,901 at 5%) to $1,482,502 ($690,075 at 3% and $485,806 at 5%).
The annual cost of PrEP was $12,001 per participant, and $621,390 per infection prevented.

CONCLUSION
The authors believe it represents an important public health strategy for the prevention of HIV transmission.


RESULTS
The response rate was 15%.
The 'ick factor' accounted for only 13% of reasons for not referring.
No respondent believed that the procedure was too risky to consider.


RESULTS
Adaptive-use DRIs remained stable over time at approximately 18% (95% CI 17% to 18%) among adults ≥15 years of age and approximately 28% (95% CI 26% to 31%) among children <15 years of age.
Similar results were observed when proportional drug use was restricted to the baseline year (ie, a static-use model).
Trends according to age group suggest a U-shaped distribution, with the highest DRIs occurring among children <10 years of age and adults ≥65 years of age.
Males had consistently higher DRIs than females for all age groups.


RESULTS
Seven new local cases and 30 previously reported cases were analyzed.
This infection is clinically similar to other forms of PD peritonitis, with household pet exposure appearing to be the strongest risk factor.
Cats are the most commonly implicated pet.
Direct contact between the pet and the equipment was commonly reported (25 of 37 patients) but was not necessary for infection to develop.
The mean duration of treatment was 15 days.
Complication rates were low, with only 11% of patients requiring PD catheter removal.
There was no mortality reported.


CONCLUSION
Not all patients undergoing TJR are equal.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed laparoscopic liver resections performed between August 2010 and July 2013 at St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto.
The primary outcomes were mortality, major morbidity and negative margins.

CONCLUSION
Laparoscopic liver resection can be safely introduced into a Canadian community teaching hospital.


CONCLUSION
Our case series and other studies suggest that bevacizumab may increase the risk of colonic perforation in the setting of SEMS.
Caution should be used when combining these therapies.


CONCLUSION
Strategies to identify and preserve nerve terminations with the open mesh procedure are needed.


RESULTS
The estimated incidence of Legionnaires' disease in Wallonia was 1.27/100,000 inhabitants.


RESULTS
Having both CFS and FM and having multiple comorbid conditions was associated with poorer health status.


INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a high incidence cancer affecting many Canadian adults each year.
Diet is important in the etiology of CRC with many dietary components identified as potential risk factors.

RESULTS
Overall, only 10.8% of men and 13.6% of women had a strong DASH pattern.


RESULTS
Median daily oral opioid consumption was approximately 1.0 tablet postoperatively on the day of surgery and was approximately 2.0 tablets by postoperative day 3.
Mean overall benefit of analgesic score ranged between 2.8 and 4.9 throughout the study.


RESULTS
Fifty-two patients (mean age 66 years [range 27 to 90 years], female sex 65%, and lower [treated] limb in 86%) with 54 ILIs were reviewed.
Wieberdink toxicity score was ≥3 in 21 (39%) procedures.
Median follow-up was 18 months (range one to 117 months).
Initial complete response (CR) was 29%, partial response 27%, stable disease 18% and progressive disease 27%.
Predictors of better initial response were low disease burden and previous treatment.
One or more treatments after ILI were common (65%).
At 12 months, 19% of ILI patients had died from melanoma but 44% of surviving patients experienced limb CR.
At 24 months, 57% of surviving patients experienced limb CR.
The quality of life in the surviving, contactable patients according to the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score was 89%.


RESULTS
Thirty-seven consenting guardians completed and returned the standardized questionnaire (response rate 62.7%).
Eleven (29.7%) patients had a previous history of or currently were receiving educational support delineated in an IEP.


RESULTS
The sham laser irradiation group presented a mean (± SD) necrotic area of 47.96±3.81%, whereas the active laser irradiation group presented 62.24±7.28%.
There was a significant difference in skin-flap necrosis areas between groups (P=0.0002).


RESULTS
There was no difference between heights at the piriform aperture.


RESULTS
The majority of students indicated they receive significantly less plastic surgery teaching than all other surgical subspecialties.
More than 44% of students not considering plastic surgery as a career indicated they may be more likely to with increased exposure.


RESULTS
Of the 270 information fields reviewed, four (1.48%) were inaccurate and 66 (24.4%) were incomplete.


RESULTS
There were no differences in demographic or clinical data between patients who completed the telephone questionnaire and those who did not.


FINDINGS
Cotrimoxazole was associated with a 37% reduction in mortality (hazard ratio, HR: 0.63; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.56-0.70).


METHODS
We focused on the six common causes of fatal child injuries - drowning, road traffic injury, falls, poisoning, burns and suffocation.
We investigated 27 interventions recommended by the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization or the European Child Safety Alliance.
We searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Lawyee for Chinese legislations using keywords and synonyms for the 27 interventions.
We reviewed the identified legislations for statements specifying the responsible implementation department.

FINDINGS
None of the interventions against drowning and falls that we investigated was covered by national laws.


METHODS
We did a systematic review for studies on child maltreatment in China using PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL-EBSCO, ERIC and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases.

FINDINGS
The corresponding losses attributable to emotional and sexual abuse in childhood were 0.47% and 0.39% of the gross domestic product, respectively.


RESULTS
The mean maternal age was 16.1 years and the mean education level was grade 9.


RESULTS
Twenty-six of 28 residents responded.
Nearly all (96%) felt familiar with important details of inpatients and that handover was effective (92%).
were mixed for professional development, with concerns about the quality of supervisors' feedback and perceived difficulty in attending daytime teaching.
All residents believed that the night-float system provided a better learning experience compared with the traditional system.
Less than 35% considered fatigue to be a notable problem, although 20% increased use of sleep aids or stimulants beyond their typical use.
Ninety-six percent believed their workload was appropriate.
All residents felt equally or less fatigued under the night-float system compared with the traditional system.
Ninety-six percent recommended that the night-float model continue as the on-call system.


RESULTS
A total of 1134 measurements (378 measurements for each flow) were recorded.


METHODS
We conducted a pilot study in 3 locations: 1 town and 2 small townships in remote Australia.
A chronic disease nurse (CDN) visited each patient over the course of a year.
We examined patient clinical outcomes and interview data.

RESULTS
A total of 21 patients participated in the pilot study.


METHODS
Countries were weighted by their population at risk of malaria to enable references to be used in optimizing the dosing of antimalarials.

FINDINGS
Large differences in weight-for-age distributions existed between the regions and between the regions and global growth standards.


FINDINGS
In total, 1295 hospital presentations were documented.
We were able to follow up 85% (1098) of patients at 48 hours and 77% (993) at 14 days.
The patients' mean age was 42 years and 64% (823) were females.
Most arrived by motorbike (722) or taxi or tuk-tuk (312).
Most common chief complaints were abdominal pain (36%; 468), respiratory problems (15%; 196) and headache (13%; 174).
Of the 1050 patients with recorded vital signs, 280 had abnormal values, excluding temperature, on arrival.
Performed diagnostic tests were recorded for 539 patients: 1.2% (15) of patients had electrocardiography and 14% (175) had diagnostic imaging.
Subsequently, 783 (60%) patients were admitted and 166 of these underwent surgery.
Significant predictors of admission included symptom onset within 3 days before presentation, abnormal vital signs and fever.
By 14-day follow-up, 3.9% (39/993) of patients had died and 19% (192/993) remained functionally impaired.

CONCLUSION
We identified ways to improve procedures, including better documentation of vital signs and increased use of diagnostic techniques.


Interventions
This project sets the threshold for cost-effectiveness as the cost of the intervention per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted less than three times the country's annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
Highly cost-effective interventions are defined as meeting a threshold per DALY averted of once the annual GDP per capita.
We argue that reliance on these thresholds reduces the value of cost-effectiveness analyses and makes such analyses too blunt to be useful for most decision-making in the field of public health.
Use of these thresholds has little theoretical justification, skirts the difficult but necessary ranking of the relative values of locally-applicable interventions and omits any consideration of what is truly affordable.
The WHO-CHOICE thresholds set such a low bar for cost-effectiveness that very few interventions with evidence of efficacy can be ruled out.
The thresholds have little value in assessing the trade-offs that decision-makers must confront.
We present alternative approaches for applying cost-effectiveness criteria to choices in the allocation of health-care resources.


FINDINGS
Comprehensiveness of care had medium to high improvement potential in 23 of 34 countries.
In all countries, doctor-patient communication had low improvement potential.
An overall stronger structure of primary care was correlated with a lower potential for improvement of continuity and comprehensiveness of care.
In countries with stronger primary care governance patients perceived less potential to improve the continuity of care.
Countries with better economic conditions for primary care had less potential for improvement of all features of person-focused care.


RESULTS
These children had a high symptom burden.
The three most common symptoms were pain, sleep problems and feeding difficulties; on average, they had 3.2 symptoms of concern.
Despite analgesic use, the frequency of pain episodes and distress were invariant over time, suggesting that treatments were not successful.
Parents experienced anxiety, depression and burden; at the same time they also reported positive life change and a high degree of spirituality.
The child's condition resulted in parental changes in living arrangements, work status and hours devoted to caregiving.

CONCLUSIONS
At least some of these challenges may be alleviated by early and organized palliative care.


RESULTS
Of the 50 children with a CCC (mean age 64 months, 48% female), 39 (78%) died in hospital, 11 (22%) died at home and 13 (26%) were <1 month of age.
In the final month of their life, 10 patients (20%) required an unplanned visit to the emergency department and seven (14%) were admitted.
Only four patients (8%) were admitted for >14 days in their final month of life.
An invasive procedure was performed in the final month of life in 27 (44%) patients.


RESULTS
Of the 115 in-center HD nurses, 100 registered for the CNE initiative and 89 completed pre and post surveys (89% response rate).
In-center HD was preferred for availability of multidisciplinary care and medical personnel in case of catastrophic events.
Home dialysis was perceived to be underutilized both at baseline and after the initiative.


RESULTS
CKD prevalence was 9.1%; twice as high for males (13.8%) than females (5.8%).


RESULTS
We screened 600 citations.
Forty-one proceeded to full-text screen; 5 met inclusion criteria.
Rates of catheter exchange/replacement, all-cause hospitalization and in-situ thrombolysis were not significantly different between groups in any of the pooled analyses.
Risk of bias within pooled studies was low.


RESULTS
Sufficient serum creatinine data were available to define AKI in 63,735 patients with 208,275 blood test instances.
In 95,569 instances the patient was prescribed a RAS antagonist of which 5.4% fulfilled criteria for AKI.
In patients with an evidence-based indication there was no difference in absolute risk of AKI.
However, prescription of RAS blockade in the absence of indication appeared to be associated with greater risk of AKI.
Observational study of data taken in primary care clinics.
No information concerning hospitalisation.
Prescribing assumptions and potential inaccurate coding.
Potential survival bias; patients surviving longer will contribute more data.


METHODS
One focus group at each site to enrich understanding of variation in care.


METHODS
Positive fluid balance was defined as >6.5 cc/kg.


RESULTS
On initial testing, cyclophosphamide was detected in the urine of all pharmacy personnel (n = 7 oncology personnel, n = 5 control personnel).
Surface wipe testing revealed contamination of the oncology pharmacy with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate before and after cleaning, as well as contamination with ifosfamide after cleaning.
The main (control) pharmacy showed no evidence of contamination with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or ifosfamide.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that environmental contamination plays a role in biological exposure to cyclophosphamide.


RESULTS
A total of 65 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy between May 2011 and January 2014 met the study inclusion criteria.
Before surgery, the 30 patients with type 2 diabetes were taking an average of 1.9 antidiabetic medications.


METHODS
Samples were assayed periodically over 18 days using a validated, stability-indicating liquid chromatographic method with ultra-violet detection.

RESULTS
Analysis of variance showed differences in the percentage remaining due to temperature (p < 0.001) and study day (p < 0.001) but not type of container (p = 0.98).


RESULTS
A greater proportion of patients with non-ESBL-EK bacteremia received appropriate empiric therapy (88% [35/40] versus 15% [6/40], p < 0.001).
Time to appropriate therapy was longer for those with ESBL-EK bacteremia (2.42 days versus 0.17 day, p < 0.001).


RESULTS
Use of the strategies revealed in the scan may improve KTA for solving complex public health problems.
Systems approaches to KTA will also benefit from robust evaluations.


RESULTS
Ninety-five percent (6628 of 6992) of patients/estates were contacted and 5042 of 6728 (75%) living patients completed BBP testing.
Three were newly diagnosed with HBV and 14 with HCV.
None tested positive for HIV.
Ninety-three percent of patients reported alternative risk factors for BBP.
An increased risk for infection among those who underwent a procedure within seven days of a known HBV or HCV case was not demonstrated.


RESULTS
In 2002, 2460 of 6747 patients (36.5%) in 28 hospitals were receiving antimicrobial therapy.
In 2009, 3989 of 9953 (40.1%) patients in 44 hospitals were receiving antimicrobial therapy (P<0.001).
Significantly increased use was observed in central Canada (37.4% to 40.8%) and western Canada (36.9% to 41.1%) but not in eastern Canada (32.9% to 34.1%).
In 2009, antimicrobial use was most common on solid organ transplant units (71.0% of patients), intensive care units (68.3%) and hematology/oncology units (65.9%).
Compared with 2002, there was a significant decrease in use of first-and second-generation cephalosporins, and significant increases in use of carbapenems, antifungal agents and vancomycin in 2009.
Piperacillin-tazobactam, as a proportion of all penicillins, increased from 20% in 2002 to 42.8% in 2009 (P<0.001).
There was a significant increase in simultaneous use of >1 agent, from 12.0% of patients in 2002 to 37.7% in 2009.


RESULTS
The vaginal bacterial community differed between the two mothers, but not different sites within the vagina.
The family Lactobacillaceae dominated in the vaginal samples, while the most abundant family in the fecal and placental samples was Micrococcineae.


CASE PRESENTATION
The patient had associated erythematous papules on the chest and enlarged axillary, submandibular, pectoral and supraclavicular lymph nodes, which regressed under treatment with penicillin.
The patient was found to have sepsis without endocarditis caused by E rhusiopathiae, associated with bronchopneumonia that was induced by a double Gram-negative infection.


RESULTS
During the study period, the three centres reported a total of 1112 kidney transplants performed.

LIMITATIONS
We validated the information from 2008 to 2011 and cannot attest to the reliability of the data beyond the study period.


RESULTS
PTHrP was elevated and no evidence of a malignancy was found.
PTHrP was not measured in these cases and may have also been elevated.

LIMITATIONS
The study is limited in that it is a description of a single patient case.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent curative resection for locally advanced rectal cancer between July 2005 and December 2010.
We determined the LNR cutoff value using a receiver operating characteristic curve.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival curves, while Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between LNR and survival.

RESULTS
We included 180 patients aged 28-83 years with median follow-up of 41.8 months.
The median number of lymph nodes examined and lymph nodes involved were 11.5 and 4, respectively, and the median LNR was 0.366.


METHODS
We performed a retrospective study of patients with acute diverticulitis diagnosed on CT scan between December 2005 and December 2010 at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, BC.
Nonresidents were excluded.
We queried the provincial cancer registry to ensure no cases of CRC were missed.

RESULTS
Of the 285 included in the analysis, the mean age was 59.4 ± 15.1 years, and 167 (58.6%) were men.
Among the 114 patients who underwent follow-up evaluation, malignancy was diagnosed in 4 (3.5%).
The overall prevalence of malignancy among patients with CT-diagnosed diverticulitis was 1.4%.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who had undergone CEA between Jul. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2013.

RESULTS
During the study period 237 CEAs were performed.
Nine patients refused the use of their personal health information in this study.
Fifty-two patients presented for follow-up examination.
of the POSAS significantly favoured the transverse incision (p = 0.03).


RESULTS
In this descriptive retrospective, single-center study, we analyzed the local database of all patients who banked sperm at the CECOS Laboratory Biology of Reproduction of La Conception University Hospital, Marseille, France, between 2004 and 2014.
The average live birth rate per transfer was 28 %.


RESULTS
Most parents (mean age 44.1 years; range 34 to 55 years) were female (n=16 [89%]), obese (n=12 [66%]) and had a university degree (n=13 [71%]).


RESULTS
The response rate was 24% (63% general paediatricians, 36% subspecialists, 1% family physicians).
Of these respondents, 68% preferred the WHO charts for infants and 49% for children and youth.

CONCLUSION
There is support for the use of the WHO data for monitoring the growth of Canadian children.
Concerns regarding the design of the charts were raised.


RESULTS
A total of 27 (67% male) subjects (mean age 24.3±6.7 years [median 23.2 years; range 16.6 to 40.3 years]) participated.
The median age at transplant was 1.7 years (range 0.5 to 17.0 years).
Seven (26%) participants underwent retransplantation.
Seventeen (63%) participants were engaged in full-time work/study.
Mean Short Form-36 version 2 scores included physical (49.6±11.1) and mental (45.3±12.5) subscale scores.
The mean score for the disease-specific quality of life tool for paediatric liver transplant recipients (the Pediatric Liver Transplant Quality of Life Tool) was 64.70±15.2.
The physical health of the young adults strongly correlated with level of involvement in work/study (r=0.803; P<0.05).


RESULTS
Twenty-four of 32 units responded to the survey (75%).
Of the respondents, 91% were medical directors and 71% worked in university hospitals.
Nine units (38%) had at least one type of mechanical ventilation protocol, most commonly for the acute and weaning phases.
The presence of a mechanical ventilation protocol was highly correlated with the coexistence of a protocol for noninvasive ventilation (P<0.001, OR 4.5 [95% CI 1.3 to 15.3]).
There were overall wide variations in ventilation practices across units.
However, units with mechanical ventilation protocols were significantly more likely to extubate neonates from the assist control mode (P=0.039, OR 8.25 [95% CI 1.2 to 59]).


RESULTS
The 75th percentile for Troponin T was 0.05 ng/mL and for NT-proBNP 652 ng/mL.
High Troponin T levels were significantly associated with deterioration in the 3 physical domains, independent of other risk factors, whereas high NT-proBNP were not associated.


RESULTS
Sixty-five percent (41/63) required surgery during a mean follow-up of 19 months.

LIMITATIONS
There were some missing data (i,e. stone type was not always available).


RESULTS
Thirty-three physicians participated (6 from surgery, 10 from critical care, and 17 from nephrology).
Following the third round of questioning, 40 process of care indicators were identified with a high level of agreement for face validity; 16 of these reached high consensus among all panelists.

LIMITATIONS
The consensus of panelists from Alberta, Canada may not be generalizable to other settings.


MEASUREMENTS
Demographics, perceived benefits, and drawbacks of ePHRs were obtained.

RESULTS
Overall 63 patients with CKD (76.2 % male, 55.6 % ≥65 years old) completed the survey.
The majority (69.8 %) expressed their intent to use an ePHR.
Perceived benefits of ePHR use included greater involvement in their own care (50.0 % indicated this), better access to lab results (75.8 %), and access to health information (56.5 %).
Although 41.9 % reported concerns about privacy of health information, there was no association between these concerns and the intent to use an ePHR.


RESULTS
Surveys were completed by 112 RTs (response rate 26.9%).
Among eight potential barriers, lack of time was ranked as the top barrier 59% of the time.
Lack of interest in performing research was the least relevant barrier.

CONCLUSION
Many RTs want to conduct research.


RESULTS
A total of 202 survey questionnaires were completed (151 from Edmonton and 51 from Ottawa).


RESULTS
More than 94% (n=36) of students agreed or strongly agreed that the simulated oropharyngeal suction was an important component in their learning experience.


INTRODUCTION
Inorganic arsenic and its metabolites are considered dangerous to human health.

CONCLUSION
We found significant associations between arsenic exposure and the prevalence of T2D and prediabetes in the Canadian population.


RESULTS
The in vitro culture increased total motility (+2.8 %, p = 0.0161) but decreased viability (-8.3 %, p = 0.007).
After 24 h of culture, the post-thaw changes in motility and viability were not significant.
Cumulated IR and DR were lower for ICSI with D1 spermatozoa than with D0 spermatozoa (IR: 21.6 % with D0 vs. 9.8 % with D1, p = 0.102; DR: 27.5 % with D0 vs. 8.3 % with D1, p = 0.049).


RESULTS
A total of 114 (28%) completed surveys were returned from 62 (65%) hospitals.
Twenty (32%) hospitals had a MIE.
Optimal pressure spans of 35 cmH2O to 40 cmH2O were used by 54% of respondents.
Fourteen of the 20 hospitals with an MIE had policies or guidelines in place, and four of these hospitals had established staff competencies.


RESULTS
The intrarater reliability ICC was 0.962 and the inter-rater reliability ICC was 0.922.


RESULTS
The Ambu® aScope™ 2 was used in 22 of 30 percutaneous bedside tracheostomies between September 9, 2012 and January 3, 2013.
One conversion to an FOB occurred during the 22 procedures due to bleeding, resulting in a convfersion rate of approximately 5%.
The rate of completion of the postprocedure questionnaire was 73% (16 of 22), with a mean 'ease of use' score of 8.19/10 (range 6/10 to 10/10) and a mean 'visualization' score of 6.1/10 (range 2/10 to 10/10).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS
Ambu® aScope™ 2 was a reasonable alternative to FOB in a selected group of patients for bedside ICU PDT.
Use of this new disposable scope will depend on local factors, processing delays and cost.


RESULTS
Three patients showed mean interfraction stent position changes of ≥1 cm when treatment measurements were compared with planning measurements.
The remaining three patients C, D, and E showed interfraction position changes of <1 cm.

CONCLUSION
Endobiliary stent migration and deformation were observed in a small subset of patients.


RESULTS
Polymerase chain reaction showed no significant changes.
The myeloperoxidase assay showed statistically significant increase in myeloperoxidase activity in groups 2, 3 and 4.
Immunohistochemistry was negative for angiogenic and proinflammatory markers.


RESULTS
There were no complications and no donor-site morbidity.


RESULTS
A total of 29 residents completed both pre- and postbiomodel questionnaires.
Overall, positive feedback was reported among all participants.


RESULTS
Four anastomoses were performed.
Intima-on-intima apposition with no intraluminal exposure of muscularis nor adventitia were observed.


RESULTS
Mean (± SD) measures for breast ptosis in the 107 volunteers (VAS: 0.80±0.14; TTO: 0.87±0.18; SG: 0.90±0.14) were significantly different (P<0.0001) from the corresponding measures for monocular blindness and binocular blindness.


METHODS
The primary outcome measured was life expectancy.


CONCLUSION
Standard NT has a high failure rate on the battlefield.


METHODS
Independently and in duplicate, we adjudicated studies for inclusion and data abstraction.
We assessed the quality and risk of bias.


CONCLUSION
The overall impression of Afghan health care providers was that mentors are appropriate and helpful.


RESULTS
Among the 248,329 hospitalized patients, intravenous magnesium use increased by 2.86 fold from 2003 to 2013.
Not all wards had an increase whereas some had nearly a 10 fold increase in use.
Despite this increase in intravenous magnesium administration, <3 % of patients were admitted on oral magnesium in 2006 and 2013.
For patients receiving intravenous magnesium only a minority were discharged on oral therapy despite low levels.


RESULTS
Interexaminer agreement for radiometric analysis was "excellent."
Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) = 4.34 (3.65, 5.03) mm; root-mean-squared error = 5.40mm.


RESULTS
Nineteen of 47 questionnaires were completed and returned.


RESULTS
No significant difference was found between ectomorphs and mesomorphs.
The compliance for the participants in this study ranged from 0.122 mm/N to 0.420 mm/N.

CONCLUSION
It may be beneficial to create multiple versions of practice mannequins to simulate variations amongst different patients.


RESULTS
Overall inter-examiner reliability was fair (k=0.43).
Poor agreement was noted in partial categories (k=0.05-0.22).


METHODS
The surveys were completed between July and September 2013.

RESULTS
Of the 243 hospitals identified, 95 (39%) had at least 0.5 FTE clinical pharmacy services in the ED (based on initial telephone screening).
Forty-four (79%) of the 56 ED pharmacist services had been established within the preceding 10 years.
Order clarification, troubleshooting, medication reconciliation, and assessment of renal dosing were the services most commonly provided.
The large majority of pharmacy managers and ED managers identified the need for ED pharmacy services where such services do not yet exist.
Inadequate funding, competing priorities, and lack of training were the most commonly reported barriers to providing this service.


RESULTS
Survey responses were obtained from 60 (63%) of 95 ED pharmacy teams and 128 (53%) of 243 ED managers.


METHODS
A cost-consequence analysis was performed for all children with a confirmed diagnosis of tyrosinemia type I who were treated in Quebec between January 1, 1984, and January 1, 2009.
Data were derived from patient charts, hospital databases, and the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec and MED-ÉCHO administrative databases.
Costs were reported in 2008 Canadian dollars.

RESULTS
Nitisinone treatment was associated with significant reductions in the number and duration of hospital admissions, the number of admissions to a pediatric intensive care unit, and the number of liver transplants.
The cost of nitisinone per person-year was $51 493 for the early-intervention group and $64 895 for the late-intervention group.


METHODS
A logistic regression model with a random intercept for each patient was constructed to estimate odds ratios and probabilities of adverse events.

RESULTS
Fifty-two ALC patients were included in the study.
Of these, 48 (92%) were taking a PIM.
Of the 922 adverse events evaluated, 407 (44.1%) were associated with a regularly scheduled PIM.
The most common PIM medication classes were first-generation antihistamines (24 [46%] of the 52 patients), antipsychotics (21 patients [40%]), short-acting benzodiazepines (15 patients [29%]), and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (14 patients [27%]).


METHODS
Three surveys were administered to first-year medical students at the University of Calgary from the classes of 2009, 2010 and 2015.

RESULTS
Overall, 42% of students (76% of decided students) reported that they would consider the rural UCLIC.
Between 2009 and 2010, the proportion of students who would not consider the UCLIC decreased from 25% to 8%, and thereafter was maintained at that level.
Over the same period, interest among students considering Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) specialties significantly increased.


METHODS
Changes in average body weight were derived from study pairs that were at least four years apart (various years, 1971-2010).
Selected study pairs were considered to be representative of an adolescent or adult population, at national or subnational scale.
Food energy supply data were retrieved from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations food balance sheets.
Finally, we estimated the change in energy intake that could theoretically account for the observed change in average body weight using an experimentally-validated model.

CONCLUSION
Policy efforts are needed to improve the healthiness of food systems and environments to reduce global obesity.


METHODS
Disability weights were taken from global burden of disease (GBD) studies.
We used the GBD 1990 disability weights and then repeated all of our calculations using the corresponding GBD 2010 weights.

FINDINGS
The disability weights assigned in the GBD 1990 study to the sequelae of conditions such as cataract, cancer and injuries were substantially different to those assigned in the GBD 2010 study.
These differences in weights led to large differences in estimates of DALYs averted.


APPROACH
People with persistent cough were referred to a physician.
The National Tuberculosis Program continued its national tuberculosis reporting system.

RELEVANT CHANGES
With funding from the World Health Organization (WHO), active case finding is now being done systematically in slums and camps.


RESULTS
All 15 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada centres agreed to participate.
The verbal numerical scale was widely used (80%) to assess pain.
One-half of respondents (53%) had access to a child life specialist.
Intranasal fentanyl was available (60%) or considered to be easy to implement (33%).


RESULTS
Systemic factors included knowledge and access to community resources, as well as the ability to provide support to the child and family.

CONCLUSION
The results from the present study identified important factors that influence paediatric practice in ASD screening.


RESULTS
A total of 835 paediatric patients with acute bronchiolitis were admitted to the paediatric ward between January 2010 and December 2012.
revealed that urinary tract infection was present in 10% of patients, and was most common in group 3 (13.4%) followed by group 2 (9.7%), and was least common in group 1 (6%) (P=0.030).


RESULTS
There were 118,892 infants with a congenital anomaly among 2,839,680 live births (41.9 per 1000).

CONCLUSION
Enhancement of preconception care initiatives for women with DM is recommended.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 65-80 years undergoing emergency general surgery between 2009 and 2010 at a tertiary care centre.
Demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, mortality and disposition characteristics of patients were collected.


METHODS
We used the Manitoba Cancer Registry to identify patients who underwent major abdominopelvic cancer surgery between 2004 and 2009.


RESULTS
We received 256 completed surveys for a response rate of 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.5-37.5%).
Fracture morphology with a mean impact of 3.31 (95% CI 3.17-3.45) and comminution with a mean impact of 3.34 (95% CI 3.21-3.46) were the 2 factors influencing surgeons' choice of fixation method the most.
The major deterrent for using plating constructs for simple displaced fractures (Mayo IIA) was better outcomes with other methods.


RESULTS
We included 3525 pre- and 3007 postintervention patients aged 50 years or older.
The proportion of patients receiving surgery within the benchmark increased from 66.8% to 84.6%, median length of stay decreased from 13.5 to 9.7 days, and crude in-hospital mortality decreased from 9.6% to 6.8% (all p < 0.001).


METHODS
We identified infants, children and young adults who underwent laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (LAPEG) tube insertion between October 2009 and June 2013.

RESULTS
We included 92 patients in our study.
Mean age was 3.7 years (range 3 wk-5 yr), and mean weight was 11.2 (range 2.8-54) kg.
Median procedural time was 20 (range 12-76) minutes.
Total median duration for the most recent 25 procedures was lower than that of the first 25 (62 v. 79 min, p = 0.004).
There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery.
Postoperative complications were observed in 6 (6.5%) patients.
Three retained T-fasteners were assessed endoscopically (n = 1) or removed via local excision (n = 2).
Two patients experienced early dislodged feeding tubes that were replaced via interventional radiology (n = 1) or repeat LAPEG (n = 1).
There was also 1 intra-abdominal fluid collection that was drained percutaneously but ultimately required a laparotomy and washout.
There were no major complications in the most recent 50 procedures.


RESULTS
Of the 244 American and 17 Canadian accredited surgical residency programs contacted, 65 (27%) and 12 (71%), respectively, participated in the survey.
Of the American residents, 67% and 6% reported receiving an incomplete handoff that resulted in minor and major patient harm, respectively.
These results mirrored those from Canadian residents (63% minor and 7% major harm).
The most frequent factor reported to improve the patient handoff process was standardization of the verbal handoff.


METHODS
We followed a prospective cohort of patients admitted to a level 1 trauma centre.
We compared patients who were discharged home with those going to rehabilitation after acute care.
Analysis consisted of bivariate comparisons and logistic regression.

RESULTS
Our study included 160 patients with a mean age of 56 years.
A total of 40% were discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation centre.


FINDINGS
The response rate was 83.4% (386/463).
Two hundred and seventy doctors (59.8%) declared that they had insufficient information about antibiotics.
Only 14.0% (54/386) recognized the possibility of cephalosporin cross-resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Most participants had no information about local antibiotic resistance for Salmonella Typhi (211/385, 54.8%) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (253/384, 65.9%).
Unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions were considered as harmless by 115 participants and 148 considered locally-available generic antibiotics to be of poor quality.
Nearly three-quarters (280/386) of participants agreed that it was difficult to select the correct antibiotics.
Most participants (373/386) welcomed educational programmes on antibiotic prescribing and 65.0% (249/383) preferred local over international antibiotic guidelines.


METHODS
We conducted a randomized non-inferiority trial on the provision of medical abortion and contraceptive counselling by physicians or nurses.
The participants were pregnant women seeking abortion at a gestational duration of 70 days or less.
The medical abortion regimen was 200 mg of oral mifepristone taken on-site followed by 800 μg of misoprostol self-administered buccally at home 24 hours later.
Women were instructed to return to the clinic for follow-up 7-15 days later.
We did an intention-to-treat analysis for risk differences between physicians' and nurses' provision for completion and the need for surgical intervention.

FINDINGS
Of 1017 eligible women, 884 women were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 450 in the physician-provision arm and 434 in the nurse-provision arm.
Women who completed medical abortion, without the need for surgical intervention, were 98.4% (443/450) for physicians' provision and 97.9% (425/434) for nurses' provision.
The risk difference between the group was 0.5% (95% confidence interval, CI: -1.2% to 2.3%).
Both types of providers were rated by the women as highly acceptable.


FINDINGS
A total of 36 studies were included in the narrative synthesis and 10 of them were used for the meta-analyses.
Compared with women in the lowest quintile of socioeconomic status, the pooled odds ratios for use of postnatal care by women in the second, third, fourth and fifth quintiles were: 1.14 (95% confidence interval, CI : 0.96-1.34), 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12-1.55), 1.60 (95% CI: 1.30-1.98) and 2.27 (95% CI: 1.75-2.93) respectively.
Compared to women living in rural settings, the pooled odds ratio for the use of postnatal care by women living in urban settings was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.01-1.81).
A qualitative assessment of the relevant published data also indicated that use of postnatal care services increased with increasing level of education.


LESSONS LEARNT
The rise in the number of suppliers of internationally quality-assured drugs was also important.
The savings achieved from lower drug costs could be used to increase the number of patients on high-quality treatment.


FINDINGS
Interrater reliability was 0.78 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.76-0.79).
Based on the implementation gaps, the experts recommended 34 actions, and prioritized seven of these.


METHODS
A computerized, audio questionnaire was used to assess participants' comprehension of informed consent.
The acceptability and ease of use of the multimedia tool were assessed in focus groups.

FINDINGS
On day 0, the median comprehension score in the intervention arm was 64% compared with 40% in the control arm (P = 0.042).
The difference remained significant at all follow-up visits.
There was no significant independent association with educational level.
The risk that a participant's comprehension score would drop to half of the initial value was lower in the intervention arm (hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI: 0.16-0.31).
Overall, 70% (42/60) of focus group participants from the intervention arm found the multimedia tool clear and easy to understand.


METHODS
We conducted random-effects meta-analyses, including subgroup analyses by aldehyde dehydrogenase variants.

FINDINGS
We identified 14 relevant studies.
Three cohort studies and four case-control studies had dose-response data.
Evidence from case-control studies showed that the increase in risk was 33.11 fold (95% CI: 8.15-134.43) in the population at large.
The difference by study design is explained by the 159 fold (95% CI: 27.2-938.2) risk among those with an inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme variant.
Applying these dose-response estimates to the national profile of alcohol intake yielded 5279 oesophageal cancer deaths and 102,988 DALYs lost - almost double the estimates produced by the most recent global burden of disease exercise.


METHODS
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, POPLINE, ECONLIT, CINAHL, LILACS, BDSP, Web of Science and Scopus databases for relevant studies, published in English, French, German, Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish up to 25 March 2014.
We included studies of interventions intended to increase demand for routine childhood vaccination.
Studies were eligible if conducted in low- and middle-income countries and employing a randomized controlled trial, non-randomized controlled trial, controlled before-and-after or interrupted time series design.
We estimated risk of bias using Cochrane collaboration guidelines and performed random-effects meta-analysis.


PROBLEM
In Zimbabwe, many health facilities are not able to manage serious obstetric complications.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Following an in-hospital train-the-trainers course, 90% (138/153) of maternity staff were trained locally within the first year, with 299 hospital staff trained to date.


RESULTS
Of the 47 patients (mean age: 54 ± 13 years), the mean delivered urea reduction was 74 ± 10 %.
Mean LV mass was 123 ± 38 g.


RESULTS
Mortality did not significantly change after PA introduction in either cases or controls.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION
PAs can improve health efficiencies in the Canadian health care setting, leading to reduction in LOS.


RESULTS
The culture positivity rate was consistent with the expected asymptomatic bacteriuria rate.
Change in mental status and male sex were associated with culture positivity.
Treatment decisions were not consistent with culture results.


RESULTS
Among the resistant strains, the sequences of 23S ribosomal RNA and gyrA, which are linked to clarithromycin and ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin resistance, respectively, revealed the presence of known point mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
In general, resistance to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin and clarithromycin has increased since the studies in the early 2000s.


RESULTS
A total of 201 FPs participated, mostly from Montérégie (n=151).
Overall, results revealed a moderate lack of knowledge and suboptimal practices rather than systematically insufficient knowledge or inadequate practices.
A majority of participants agreed to more education on LD.

CONCLUSION
Such practices should be discouraged because they are unnecessary and overuse collective laboratory and medical resources.
In addition, public health authorities must pursue their education efforts regarding FPs to optimize case management.


RESULTS
Total sperm count was reduced up to 12 months after the second dose of (131)I.
Sperm DFI was increased 3.25 months after the first dose of (131)I.
All parameters returned to normal values 28 months after the second (131)I dose.


FINDINGS
Between 1991 and 2007, detection rates for sputum-smear-positive tuberculosis in the European Union were stable at approximately 85%.
During the economic recession (2008-2011) detection rates declined by a mean of 5.22% (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.54-7.90) but treatment success rates showed no significant change (P = 0.62).
An equivalent fall in spending on public health services was associated with a 2.74% (95% CI: 0.31-5.16) mean reduction in the detection rate.
Mathematical models suggest that the recession and consequent austerity policies will lead to increases in tuberculosis prevalence and tuberculosis-attributable mortality that are projected to persist for over a decade.


METHODS
Cross-sectional data from households and health facilities in Tandahimba and Newala districts were used in the analysis.
The interventions studied were syphilis and pre-eclampsia screening, partograph use, active management of the third stage of labour and postpartum care.

CONCLUSION
The poor effective coverage of maternal and newborn health interventions in rural districts of the United Republic of Tanzania reinforces the need to prioritize health service quality.
Access to high-quality local data by decision-makers would assist planning and prioritization.


METHODS
We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis from May 2011 to November 2013.
History of tobacco smoking was collected using a standardized questionnaire adapted from the global adult tobacco survey.
We considered tuberculosis therapy to have a poor outcome if participants defaulted, failed treatment or died.
We used multivariable regressions to estimate the risk of a poor treatment outcome.

FINDINGS
Of the 591 tuberculosis patients enrolled, 188 (31.8%) were past smokers and 271 (45.9%) were current smokers.
Ninety (33.2%) of the current smokers and 24 (18.2%) of the participants who had never smoked had previously been treated for tuberculosis (P < 0.01).
Compared with those who had never smoked, current smokers had an increased risk of poor treatment outcome (adjusted relative risk, aRR: 1.70; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.00-2.90).
Those who had ceased smoking more than two months before enrolment did not have such an increased risk (aRR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.51-1.99).


METHODS
We conducted a population-based matched longitudinal study - based on administrative data from Western Australia's hospital morbidity data system and death register.
A cohort of 6014 individuals who were aged at least 45 years when hospitalized for a first burn injury in 1980-2012 was identified.
We used Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression to analyse the data and generated mortality rate ratios and attributable risk percentages.

FINDINGS
For those hospitalized with burns, 180 (3%) died in hospital and 2498 (42%) died after discharge.
In this cohort, the long-term mortality attributable to burn injury was 29%.
Mortality risk was increased by both severe and minor burns, with adjusted mortality rate ratios of 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1-1.9) and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.9-2.3), respectively.


PROBLEM
Suboptimal care contributes to perinatal mortality rates.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Five years of continuous audits were available for 163 facilities.
Perinatal mortality rates decreased in 48 facilities (29%) and increased in 52 (32%).
Among the subset of facilities that began audits in 2006, there was a decrease in perinatal mortality of 30% (16/54) but an increase in 35% (19/54).


RESULTS
We recruited 248 patients in 3 centres to our main study, which required only biochemical markers.
Of these 164 were at St Joseph's healthcare, and eligible to participate in the substudy; of these, 51 completed CT scanning (31 %).
Median follow up was 26 months (Q1, Q3: 14, 34).
The primary outcome occurred in 16 patients; 11 in the group above the median and 5 in the group below (p = 0.086).
There were 26 primary outcomes in 16 patients; 20 (77 %) events in the group above the coronary calcification median and 6 (23 %) in the group below (p = 0.006).
There were 10 deaths; 8 in the group above the median compared with 2 in the group below (p = 0.04).


RESULTS
The survey response rate was 96%.
Some respondents reported that they routinely suctioned mechanically ventilated patients rather than as required.


RESULTS
All patients, except one, were receiving dialysis for end-stage kidney disease.
The mean ± SD ERI values in the low (n = 18), medium (n = 18) and high (n = 17) ERI tertiles were 1.4 ± 0.3, 2.3 ± 0.2 and 3.5 ± 0.8 IU/kg/week/gHb, respectively (P < 0.001).
The median [inter-quartile range] serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations in the low, medium and high ERI tertiles were 89 [64,121], 99 [76,134 and 148 [87,175] U/L, respectively (P = 0.054).
There was a weak but statistically significant association between ERI and serum alkaline phosphatase (R(2) = 0.06, P = 0.03).
Using multinomial logistic regression, the risk of being in the high ERI tertile relative to the low ERI tertile increased with increasing serum alkaline phosphatase levels (P = 0.02).
No other variables were significantly associated with ERI.


METHODS
An electronic survey was distributed to key informants in Canadian health care delivery organizations.

RESULTS
Forty-three of 99 key informants responded to the survey.
Twenty-nine respondents (67%) indicated that their organization had a CPR team, and 10 (23%) indicated participation by pharmacists on a CPR team.


RESULTS
A total of 138 patients met the inclusion criteria, 72 in the control group and 66 in the treatment group.
For most patients in the treatment group, the dose was 15 or 30 g of SPS orally.
No difference was observed in terms of mean change in serum potassium between patients who received 15 and 30 g of SPS (-0.51 ± 0.38 and -0.66 ± 0.40 mmol/L, respectively; p = 0.13).

CONCLUSIONS
Although this difference was statistically significant, the small treatment effect observed in this study may not be clinically important.
Furthermore, the cost and potential adverse effects of treatment suggest that routine use of SPS may be inappropriate for patients with mild hyperkalemia.
Prospective randomized controlled trials would help in further evaluating the effectiveness and safety of SPS.


RESULTS
Of the 148 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 99 (66.9%) received iron by a conventional accelerated regimen and 49 (33.1%) by a once-weekly IV regimen.
The mean weekly dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent was significantly lower in the once-weekly administration group than in the conventional administration group (7419 versus 10 706 units; p = 0.041).
The 2 groups did not differ significantly in terms of hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.46) or ferritin level (p = 0.13).


METHODS
We conducted a systematic review of two youth suicide prevention programs to help determine if the quality of evidence available justifies their wide spread dissemination.
We searched Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Campbell Collaboration SPECTR database, SocIndex, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, ERIC, Social Work Abstracts, Research Library, and Web of Science, for relevant studies.
We included studies/systematic reviews/meta-analysis that evaluated the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and/or safety of Signs of Suicide (SOS) and Yellow Ribbon (YR) suicide prevention programs that target adolescents.
We applied the Office of Justice Program What Works Repository (OJP-R) to evaluate the quality of the included studies as effective, effective with reservation, promising, inconclusive evidence, insufficient evidence, and ineffective.
Two SOS studies were ranked as "inconclusive evidence" based on the OJP-R.
One SOS study was ranked as having "insufficient evidence" on OJP-R.
The YR study was ranked as "ineffective" using OJP-R.
We only included studies in peer-reviewed journals in English and therefore may have missed reports in grey literature or non-English publications.


METHODS
The study was conceptualized as a mixed methods sequential explanatory approach using a quasi-experimental (before and after) design with quantitative and qualitative components.


RESULTS
Most were male (62 %) and Caucasian (91 %).
The cohort had a high proportion of diabetes (48 %), history of previous myocardial infarction (31 %) and heart failure (22 %).


CONCLUSIONS
Gaps in content and research include the lack of standard frameworks and a glossary for infectious disease modelling.


RESULTS
There were 192 consenting attendees of the fair, of whom 112 were included in the study.
Of the participants, 91% were Chinese.
More than 40% of participants had been previously exposed to HBV (42% [95% CI 33% to 51%]).
Almost 20% demonstrated nonimmunity to HBV (19% [95% CI 12% to 27%]).
There was significant discordance when questionnaire answers regarding vaccination status were compared with serological profiles.


RESULTS
A total of 799 patients underwent MRSA screening swabs before SAB.
Of the 799 patients, 95 (12%) had a positive and 704 (88%) had a negative previous MRSA screening swab.
There were 150 (19%) patients with MRSA bacteremia.


RESULTS
Four hundred eleven HIV-infected patients were identified from January 1, 2003 to November 30, 2011.
Two hundred eighteen (53%) were male, mean (± SD) age was 35.6 ±10.1 years, 257 (70.8%) were First Nations or Métis, 312 (80.2%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected and 300 (73.3%) had a history of injection drug use (IDU).
Using ethnicity, HCV and IDU, three multivariate models (models 1, 2, 3) were built due to high correlation.
Age was marginally significant in model 2 (P=0.055).


RESULTS
The subclavian and transerve cervical arteries were used, and the subclavian, internal jugular and cephalic veins were used for microanastomosis.
No cases of flap failure were reported.


RESULTS
Histopathological examination findings corroborated the unfavourable effects of CS and preventive effects of BTX type A.

CONCLUSION
Preoperative administration of BTX significantly enhanced flap viability in the rats exposed to CS.


RESULTS
A total of 219 procedures were included in the retrospective review.
The mean age of subjects was 13.1 years (range two weeks to 18 years).


RESULTS
Surgeons were highly satisfied with the new system, citing benefits to patients and surgeons.

CONCLUSION
Surprisingly, the injury-to-surgery interval was slightly increased.
However, this was not clinically significant and did not lead to increased postoperative complications.


RESULTS
The rate of fall-related injuries among seniors increased from 49.4 to 58.8 per 1000 population between 2005 and 2013, during which the number of fall-related injuries increased by 54% overall.
The upward trend in fall-related injury rates was more prominent among women and younger age groups.
The most common type of injury was broken or fractured bones (37%), and the shoulder or upper arm (16%) was the most commonly injured body part.
Many fall-related injuries occurred while walking on a surface other than snow or ice (45%).
Over 70% of seniors seeking treatment for their injuries visited a hospital emergency department.


INTRODUCTION
However, there is paucity of data with regard to juvenile OCD.


METHODS
This was a cross-sectional correlational study.
Youth were recruited from two agencies providing services to street-involved youth in Canada.


METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed 121 consecutive liver resections performed at a single institution.

RESULTS
Of 121 procedures analyzed, IOUS was used in 88.
A change in tumour size and location were detected in 2 (2%) and 3 (4%) patients, respectively.
Surgical plans were altered in 7 (8%) cases for reasons not related to IOUS.


METHODS
Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analyzed.


METHODS
The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey.
They were asked to compare their training to resident training today.

RESULTS
Sixty-nine surveys were completed.


METHODS
We extracted data using a standardized form and assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

RESULTS
Seven studies were identified (6780 patients) from 3936 initial search results.


RESULTS
There were 141 PTB suspects.
Sputum examination was requested and performed in 67 (48%) suspects, but none were smear-positive.
Chest X-ray (CXR) was requested and performed in 26 (39%) suspects whose sputum smears were negative.
Eleven suspects had a CXR suggestive of PTB: two were started on TB treatment and eight died before treatment started.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was known for 50 patients (35% of all suspects) on admission, all of whom were HIV-positive.
HIV testing was requested for 37 patients, but was only performed in 12, five of whom were HIV-positive.
Only one patient was referred for antiretroviral treatment.
There were 41 (29%) deaths, eight of whom had probable TB and were not treated.
In the remaining 33 patients who died, only nine (27%) had sputum smears examined and four (12%) had a CXR.


RESULTS
There was wide variability in the ART start time before and after the policy change.
The proportion of all co-infected patients on ART increased from 32% before the policy change to 39% after (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION
Earlier initiation of ART in co-infected patients receiving TB treatment improved the uptake and continuation of ART.


DESIGN
Retrospective analysis of routine programme data.

RESULTS
A total of 31 763 registrations and 2922 deaths in the EMR were compared with those in the paper registers.
In one hospital, up to 24% of overall case registrations were missing from the paper registers.
There were major differences in the number of registered deaths in two of the five facilities.


RESULTS
There were 16 145 suspects screened for TB and recorded in the laboratory registers.
Of 1698 smear-positive patients identified in the laboratory registers, 101 (6%) could not be identified in the treatment registers.

CONCLUSION
Strategies are urgently needed to improve the registration and follow-up of smear-positive cases in tertiary care institutions.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.

CONCLUSION
CXR was useful in identification of TB suspects in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.


DESIGN
Retrospective cohort study.

RESULTS
Of 1800 TB patients, 1100 (61%) were tested, of whom 877 (80%) were HIV-positive and 75 (9%) were documented as receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART).
HIV testing and HIV positivity were similar between patients with different types of TB.


RESULTS
The treatment success rate for new smear-positive TB cases for 2006 was 73%, lower than the national average of 78%.

CONCLUSIONS
The NTP and PHS need better collaboration to improve TB control in Malawian prisons.


METHODS
Random selection of TB case registers among all treatment units in Cambodia, two provinces in China, and Viet Nam.
The data of two calendar years were analyzed to assess unsuccessful outcomes and their time of occurrence.

RESULTS
Among the 33 309 TB patients, treatment was unsuccessful in respectively 10.1%, 3.0% and 9.1% of patients in Cambodia, China and Viet Nam.
Half of all deaths occurred in the first 2 months in Cambodia and within 11 weeks in China and Viet Nam.
Median time to default was 3 months in Cambodia and Viet Nam, and about 2 months in China.


DESIGN
The campaign was implemented concurrently with a population-based LTBI survey.

RESULTS
This decrease was not observed in communities where the intervention was not implemented.
There was no decrease in the TB incidence rate ratio between Blacks and non-Blacks in either region during the study period.


DESIGN
Between October 2010 and March 2011, data on ART outcomes were extracted from monitoring tools at five facilities.
Pharmacy data on ART consumption were extracted.
Workload for each method was observed and timed.
We used intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman plots to compare the agreeability of both methods to determine treatment retention.

RESULTS
However, there is a non-significant trend towards agreeability between the two methods (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.9; P > 0.05).


RESULTS
An MDR-TB team established a community-based program with either home-based DOT or local facility-based DOT.
Multiple challenges were experienced, including system delays, stigma and limited funding.


RESULTS
Of the 2655 HIV-positive TB patients, 1115 (42%) were documented as receiving ART.
Of these, 178 (16%) started ART prior to anti-tuberculosis treatment.
Of those who started after anti-tuberculosis treatment, 17% started within 2 weeks, 43% between 2 and 8 weeks and 40% after 8 weeks.
Treatment success in the cohort was 82%, with 14% deaths before completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment.
There were no differences in TB treatment outcomes by timing of ART initiation.


RESULTS
TB treatment delay decreased from 75/412 (18.2%) in Q4 2008 to 52/394 (13.2%) in Q4 2009 (P = 0.05).

CONCLUSION
In Q4 2009, sputum smear-negative TB notifications increased and treatment delay decreased.
However, accurate diagnosis of TB is challenging in this setting, and misdiagnosis and overtreatment may occur.


RESULTS
Of 1221 MDR-TB source cases identified, 189 (15.5%) were registered in Khayelitsha; 31 (16.4%) had at least one child contact assessed.


RESULTS
The median age of the children was 35 months: 48 (48%) were boys, 4 (4%) were human immunodeficiency virus infected and 47 (47%) were of coloured ethnicity.


RESULTS
A record review of nine of 10 TBDCs was conducted, with interviews of 33 of the 49 current members.
During the second and third quarters of 2009, respectively 1142 and 1563 sn-PTB cases were evaluated by the TBDCs in both cities.
Of these, 53% in Manila City and 65% in Quezon City were classified as active TB patients.
There were significant variations in the percentage of patients recommended for anti-tuberculosis treatment by the TBDC.
The participation of its members is based on their expressed commitment to program sustainability.


DESIGN
The study project began with the local adaptation of international asthma guidelines, followed by a situation analysis, pre-intervention study, training and intervention.
Inhaled beclomethasone (US$15 for a 200-puff [250 µg/puff] inhaler) was prescribed for patients with persistent asthma.
Treatment outcome was assessed at 1 year after enrolment.

RESULTS
Asthma was never diagnosed in the participating facilities before the project was introduced.


RESULTS
The majority (59%) of these children were females; 97.5% were aged 6-17 months.


RESULTS
Of 663 households visited, 492 (74%) had no LLIN and 135 (20%) had one LLIN.
Of 171 households with LLINs, these were consistently used by 73 (43%) children.


RESULTS
During 2010, 21 357 children aged <5 years were admitted and 1520 died, resulting in an overall in-patient mortality rate among under-fives of 7%.
This remained the same after considering the three most common causes of mortality per hospital.
One hospital with a neonatal unit showed a mortality rate of 14%.
Of the 10 most common causes of mortality in the eight hospitals, severe malaria, acute lower respiratory tract infection and neonatal infection counted for about 77% of total deaths.
Ranking the 10 most common causes of mortality according to case-fatality rates, septicemia, meningitis, low birth weight with pathology, neonatal infection and neonatal asphyxia were the most common (case-fatality rates 15-40%).


RESULTS
Of 2420 TB cases identified, 709 (29%) were registered as smear-negative pulmonary TB.
Of the 695 (98%) with information on smear examination, 222 (32%) had no smear recorded, 61 (9%) had one smear, 86 (12%) two smears and 326 (47%) three smears.

CONCLUSION
NTPs in Kiribati and the Marshall Islands are diagnosing 29% of all TB patients as smear-negative pulmonary TB.
Corrective measures are needed.


RESULTS
Of 1376 patients analyzed, 750 (55%) were female.
The mean age of the patients in the clinics was 53.5 years (95%CI 52.2-54.8), with an average duration of diabetes of 8.1 years (95%CI 7.6-8.7).
Of all patients, 5.6% reported a history of TB, similar to the frequency about 20 years earlier (1990) in Tanzania.
Only 30% of the patients reported knowing their HIV status; 6% were HIV-positive.
A history of tobacco smoking was reported by 3.8% of the patients.


DESIGN
Teachers provided health education on TB before distributing the survey cards.
Data were routinely collected in the implementation of the FIDELIS project, and quarterly reports from the National Tuberculosis Programme were analysed.
The detection of new smear-positive TB cases before and after FIDELIS, as well as with and without FIDELIS, were compared.

RESULTS
Case detection in FIDELIS counties increased by a factor of 3.5 during the FIDELIS period compared with before FIDELIS, and that in non-FIDELIS counties by a factor of 3.1 (P = 0.001).


RESULTS
A total of 3376 TB patients were registered, of whom 2665 (79%) were HIV-tested and 2042 (77%) were HIV-infected.

CONCLUSION
This confirms recommendations that co-infected TB patients should start ART early.


RESULTS
The proportion of patients who had at least one hospitalisation per year decreased significantly, from 32.1% to 5.7% (P < 0.0001).
The annual per patient median direct health care cost was US$169.
Using asthma controllers continuously gave better asthma control than using them intermittently (OR 12.9, 95%CI 4.7-35.7).


RESULTS
The overall treatment success rate was 93%, and none of the demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with treatment outcomes.
A few recording deficiencies were identified.


RESULTS
From 2009 to 2011, 182 children with TB were diagnosed and treated (4.5% of total cases), 153 (84%) by the NTP and 29 (16%) by the GH; the latter were not notified to the NTP.
The incidence rate of notified TB cases was between 8 and 13 per 100 000 population, and was higher in children aged >5 years.
Of 167 children tested, 29% were HIV-positive.
Treatment success was 72% overall, with success rates of 86%, 62% and 74%, respectively, among sputum smear-positive, sputum smear-negative and extra-pulmonary patients.
Treatment success rates were lower in children with sputum smear-negative TB (62%) and those with HIV infection (58%).


RESULTS
Of 925 patients, 840 were available to submit sputum at 2 months, of whom 137 (16%) were smear-positive.
Final treatment outcomes were similar, regardless of smear conversion at 2 or 3 months.

CONCLUSION
Certain characteristics were risk factors for failure to smear convert at 2 months.
However, treatment outcomes for all patients were good.
These findings have implications for the modification of national programme recommendations.


RESULTS
WTP and willingness to be vaccinated were high, at 84.5% and 92.6%, respectively.


RESULTS
The proportion of all TB cases registered as EPTB over a period of 10 years varied from 30% to 40%.
In 2010, 505 patients were registered with EPTB, of whom 50% were male, 21% were children, and 96% were new EPTB cases.
TB lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion were the two most common types of EPTB, accounting for 67%, followed by abdominal TB and spinal/bone/kidney disease.
The overall treatment success rate was 90%, and was generally similar with respect to sex, age and different types of EPTB.


RESULTS
The proportion of TB cases who failed to link to TB care decreased from 23% to 14% between 2009 and 2012.
Almost 40% of cases with hepatotoxicity required an adjusted treatment regimen.


RESULTS
Available data from 2007 onwards showed relatively low vacancy rates (range 0.4-2%), with a sharp rise to 15% in 2009.


DESIGN
Retrospective descriptive and analytical study.

RESULTS
Mortality rates were much higher among Fijian women, and were far higher in women aged ≥45 years.


RESULTS
The prevalence of anaemia, hepatitis B and syphilis were respectively 22%, 2% and 5%.

CONCLUSION
The prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women has declined but remains high, and further research is required to identify the major causes of this condition in Fiji.
The prevalence of syphilis has remained static, while hepatitis B has decreased over the past decade.
There are some gaps in the implementation of effective interventions to manage these conditions in pregnant women.


RESULTS
Of 103 asthma patients identified during situation analysis, only 11 (11%) were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids.


RESULTS
Among 230 schools, 33 (14%) had no canteen data.
Of the 197 schools with data, only 31 (16%) were fully compliant with national school canteen guidelines, while the remaining 166 (84%) did not fully comply with the guidelines.
This was irrespective of school location or whether the canteen was school or commercially operated.
In a random sample (n = 44 schools), overweight and obesity were more common among children in non-compliant schools than in fully compliant schools (40% vs. 32%, P < 0.001).


DESIGN
Retrospective review of clinical records and SGBV register.

RESULTS
Survivors attending the clinic increased from seven in 2007 to 866 in 2011.
Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was given to 536 (94%), prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections to 731 (96%) and emergency contraception to 358 (83%) eligible patients.
Hepatitis B and tetanus toxoid vaccinations were given to 774 survivors, but respectively only 46% and 14% received a second injection.
Eight (4.5%) of 174 women who underwent urine pregnancy testing were positive at 1 month.
Of 851 survivors HIV-tested at baseline, 96 (11%) were HIV-positive.


RESULTS
A total of 475 women with obstetric fistula underwent surgical repair.
This indicates progressive loss to follow-up, reaching 82% by 6 months.

CONCLUSION
Steps to address this operational problem are discussed.


DESIGN
Secondary analysis of routine programme data.

CONCLUSIONS
This study advocates for the implementation of routine measures to monitor and improve rational drug use and the quality of clinical care in such hospitals.


DESIGN
Cross-sectional study.

RESULTS
The highest case-fatality rate was for meningitis (20%).
Adverse outcomes occurred in 378 (6%) children, including 205 (3.3%) deaths; 173 (2.8%) absconded.


RESULTS
Of the 149 care givers (93% female) interviewed, 60% expressed problems with PPN acceptability.
It is to be noted that 47% of children needed encouragement or were forced to eat PPN, while 5% completely rejected it after 3 weeks.
Of the 29 CHWs interviewed, 48% were dissatisfied with PPN's taste and consistency, and 55% with its smell.
However, 91% of the care givers and all CHWs still perceived a therapeutic benefit of PPN for malnourished children.


RESULTS
Although general national and provincial OH policies are in place, no specific OH policies exist for hospital settings.
Two hospitals offered isoniazid preventive therapy to HIV-positive staff and reassigned these staff to low TB risk areas.

CONCLUSIONS
While OH policies and procedures are in place, implementation of these policies and procedures is inconsistent.
This potentially places HCWs at risk of acquiring TB.
These findings support the need for strengthening OH and IC services to prevent TB.


RESULTS
Treatment success rates for all categories of retreatment cases ranged between 28% and 54%.
Relapse smear-positive (P = 0.002) and treatment after failure (P = 0.038) cases were less likely to have a successful treatment outcome.


CONCLUSIONS
Steps needed to address this problem are discussed.


RESULTS
Residence outside of Benin was associated with a higher risk of RMP resistance (RR 3.13, 95%CI 2.19-4.48, P < 0.01).
From 2003 to 2011, the prevalence of RMP resistance decreased from 25% to 5% among patients living in Benin.
Of patients failing treatment, 48% were fully susceptible, 22% were monoresistant and 8% polyresistant.


DESIGN
A descriptive cross-sectional study.

RESULTS
All 721 patients treated for LTBI in 2009 in Norway were included, of whom 607 (84%) completed treatment.
The treatment regimen generally consisted of 3 months of rifampicin and isoniazid.
The three main reasons for starting treatment were: 1) countries of origin with high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence, 2) a positive tuberculin skin test, and 3) a positive interferon gamma release assay.
The use of directly observed treatment varied by health region and age.
The majority of the 34 medical specialists interviewed saw a need for new national guidelines to improve the selection of high-risk patients with LTBI.


CONCLUSIONS
Through the implementation of this procedure, we expect to improve data quality, completeness, and use of routine ART clinical data in low-resource settings.


RESULTS
A total of 545 HIV-infected patients with KS (58% male, median age 33 years) were included in the study.
The baseline median CD4 count was 180 cells/µl (interquartile range 111-287).
The survival probability for 229 patients who received at least one course of VCR was 65% at 1 year, 42% at 2 years and 13% by 6 years.


RESULTS
Clinic nurses acknowledged problems of staff shortages, lengthy waiting times and conflict between staff and community members.
Adherence was affected by social problems, stigma about TB and its link to the human immunodeficiency virus, and the extended treatment period.


RESULTS
Of 1179 records of infectious adult cases, 33.3% had no documentation of contacts.


DESIGN
Retrospective record review.

RESULTS
Of 606 HIV-infected children started on IPT, 556 (91.7%) successfully completed treatment, while 20 (3.3%) completed with interruptions.
TB disease was diagnosed in a median of 3 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 2-16) post-IPT initiation.
Isoniazid resistance was not detected in the four culture-confirmed TB cases.


DESIGN
Retrospective cohort study.

CONCLUSION
Only two thirds of children clinically treated for DR-TB were recorded in the electronic reporting system, suggesting under-reporting.
We also found a lower than expected prevalence of childhood DR-TB, probably suggesting both under-diagnosis and under-recording of DR-TB in children.
Clinicians at facility level should be able to access the electronic reporting system, and data transfer between clinical paper-based and electronic sources should be simplified.
Improved recording and reporting of DR-TB in children is needed.


RESULTS
Of 1886 presumptive TB patients, HIV status was ascertained for 842 (44.6%); 28 (3.3%) were HIV-positive.
The median increase in the number of clients tested for HIV per day per testing centre was 1 (range 0-6).

CONCLUSION
The uptake of HIV testing was low.
HIV prevalence was higher among presumptive TB patients than in antenatal women, and as high as in TB patients.


RESULTS
The median weight gain among 29 patients after 4-6 months was 6 kg.


DESIGN
A cross-sectional, record-based study was undertaken to analyse patient records from routine laboratory registers in all DMCs from January to June 2012.
RESULT
More than 50% of presumptive TB cases had to travel >7 km to reach the DMC, totalling >28 km for two sputum examinations for the evaluation of an episode.
There was a significant correlation (r = 0.7) between distance to the DMC and time to initiate treatment among smear-positive TB cases.


DESIGN
Cohort study of routinely collected data.

RESULTS
A total of 3134 TB patients were registered from May 2011 to April 2012.
Of these, 615 (20%) were current smokers, with a mean age of 38 years (±13.8).


DESIGN
Local adaptation of guidelines, followed by situational analysis, pre-intervention study, training and implementation.

RESULTS
Situational analysis revealed that inhaled beclometasone was not available in the public sector.
Of the 1654 patients with persistent asthma who were treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 1157 (70.0%) had treatment cards available for outcome assessment.
Of these, 652 (56.4%) did not attend their annual evaluation, among whom 1 (0.1%) died and 651 (56.3%) were lost to follow-up.
Of the 505 patients who attended their annual evaluation, 417 (82.6%) improved, 32 (6.3%) were stable and 56 (11.1%) were worse.
The frequency of emergency visits and hospitalisation decreased substantially among those who presented for the 1 year follow-up assessment.


RESULTS
Several differences in outcomes were found between males and females.


DESIGN
A retrospective record review.
The first three visits were part of the treatment, while the fourth was for assessment of sustained weight gain.

RESULTS
Of the 1027 children admitted, 900 (88%) completed in-patient care.
Of these, 685 (76%) attended the first three follow-up visits, 482 (70%) of whom gained >15% of their admission weight.
Those unable to gain >15% weight by the third visit had a significantly lower proportion of sustained weight gain at the fourth visit.
Children aged ⩾6 months had significantly higher odds (OR 4.5, 95%CI 3.1-6.2, P < 0.05) of completing in-patient care.


DESIGN
Prospective nested cohort study.

RESULTS
Of the 350 women enrolled, the median age was 29 years (range 18-49); 84 (24%) were HIV-1-infected.
At enrollment, 54 (15%) had an abnormal cytology, 39 (11%) had low-grade intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL) and 15 (4%) high-grade intraepithelial lesions (HSIL).
HIV-1-infected women were 2.7 times (95%CI 1.7-4.4) more likely to have CIN than non-HIV-1-infected women.
Among HIV-1-infected women, the prevalence of LSIL and HSIL was 2.5 times (95%CI 1.2-5.1) and seven times (95%CI 2.3-23.3) greater than among non-HIV-infected women.


RESULTS
Of 2285 women who delivered, the main complications were prolonged labour 331 (14%), arrested labour 238 (10%), previous uterine intervention 203 (9%), breech 171 (8%) and multiple gestations 150 (7%).
A high proportion of these neonates were delivered by caesarean section and needed active birth resuscitation.
Of 67 (15%) neonatal deaths in special services, 85% were due to conditions linked to low birth weight and birth asphyxia.


DESIGN
Before and after cohort study.


DESIGN
TB data were linked to HIV clinic data at 50 facilities that provided ART.
Associations with HIV clinic enrollment and ART were evaluated.

RESULTS
Adding HIV clinic data increased HIV clinic enrollment and ART documentation to respectively 62% and 44%.


RESULTS
Of 2983 participants, respectively 34 (1%), 1488 (50.5%) and 1461 (49.5%) had unknown, positive and negative HIV status.
A positive symptom screen was found in respectively 8% (119/1488) and 5% (67/1461) of the HIV-infected and non-infected women.
The median CD4 count at enrolment was 377 cells/μl (IQR 244-530) for HIV-infected women.
One non-HIV-infected patient was sputum-positive.
For HIV-infected women, TB was presumptively treated in 1% (16/1488) based on clinical symptoms and chest X-ray.
Cumulatively, anti-tuberculosis treatment was offered to 0.6% (17/2949) of the participants.


RESULTS
Twelve (50%) of 24 screened contacts aged <5 years were provided isoniazid prophylaxis.
Three enhanced models of TB contact tracing were piloted to screen contacts in the community.


RESULTS
Among 520 patients (176 infected with the human immunodeficiency virus), the proportions of culture-negative patients with NN, discordant (PN or NP) and PP patterns were approximately 98%, 80% and 40%, respectively.
The smear-positive culture-negative phenomenon was more frequent in follow-up smear results graded 1+, followed by 2+ and 3+.

CONCLUSION
There is justification for discontinuing the examination of second specimens during treatment follow-up among TB patients.
The World Health Organization may need to reconsider its recommendation on this issue.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 123 patients referred from the Dhaka Medical College Hospital to different DOTS treatment centres during July-October 2012.
Factors associated with treatment delay (>1 day between referral and initiation of DOTS treatment) were identified.

RESULTS
Among the 123 patients referred from the hospital, treatment delay was found to range between 2 and 17 days (median 2).
In bivariate analysis, treatment delay was found to be significantly associated with the patient's diagnostic category.


RESULTS
The treatment success rate was 69%; 9% failed treatment, which may indicate extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or pre-XDR-TB.

CONCLUSION
These issues need to be addressed.


RESULTS
Publicly procured anti-tuberculosis drugs were sufficient to treat all reported new tuberculosis (TB) cases from 2007 to 2011 in the Philippines.
Fixed-dose combination drugs comprised the main bulk (81%) of private market sales, while sales of loose drugs decreased over the years.
Key second-line drugs are not available in the private market, making it impossible to design an adequate treatment regimen for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the private sector.


RESULTS
Tuberculosis was the topic in 68%; only three studies in the 8 years were on other lung diseases.
Several problems encountered are highlighted.
All applications were approved except six, either immediately or after modification.


RESULTS
Of 7083 DM patients, 38 already had TB.
Of the remainder, 125 (1.8%) had TB symptoms; 71 were investigated and 12 were newly diagnosed with TB.
Of the 50 TB patients, 64% had smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB).

CONCLUSION
Screening of DM patients for TB was feasible in a tertiary care hospital.
The yield of new TB cases was low and merits further investigation.
Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were different in patients with DM and TB compared to those with DM only.


DESIGN
Descriptive study: TB patients registered between January and September 2012 were interviewed about DM history.
FBG of ≥126 mg/dl and 110-125 mg/dl were considered indicative of DM and IFG, respectively.

RESULTS
Of 556 TB patients, 553 (99%) were assessed: 36 (6.5%) had diabetes (14 had been previously diagnosed DM and 22 were newly diagnosed), and 39 (7%) had IFG.
The median (interquartile range) time to DM diagnosis was 5 (1-17) days.
Age ≥35 years was associated with DM.


RESULTS
Of these, 298 (32.4%) were diabetic: 235 (26%) had previously known DM and 63 (7%) were newly diagnosed.
Overall, age >50 years and pulmonary tuberculosis were independently associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes.


RESULTS
Talking therapies were rated the most effective across all disorders, but also the most painful.
Treatments involving fear exposure were rated the most painful.


RESULTS
This study shows a clear response of CO2 absorption to photosynthetic photon flux density (Qp), but it varies according to the seasons.
After a significant and long dry period, the ecosystem respiration (R) has increased immediately to the first significant rains.
No clear dependency of ecosystem respiration on temperature has been observed.
The degraded woodlands are probably the "carbon neutral" at the annual scale.
The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was negative during wet season and positive during dry season, and its annual accumulation was equal to +29 ± 16 g C m-2.
The ecosystem appears to be more efficient in the morning and during the wet season than in the afternoon and during the dry season.


CONCLUSION
The variability of perioperative practice in Canadian vascular surgery is likely due to multiple factors, including a lack of specific evidence.


CONCLUSIONS
Future prospective studies are needed to establish these findings.


RESULTS
Of 2276 children undergoing screening, 155 had NAID, corresponding to a prevalence of 7% (95% CI 5.95% to 8.05%).
A total of 58 (37%) children underwent a follow-up laboratory test, of whom 38 (65.5%) had resolution of NAID, 15 (25.9%) had persistence of NAID and two (3.4%) had progression of NAID to anemia.

CONCLUSION
NAID is common in early childhood and is associated with modifiable risk factors.
Substantial practice variation exists in the management of NAID.


RESULTS
The median age was 44-days-old.
Clean-catch technique sensitivity was 97% (95% CI 82% to 100%) and specificity was 89% (95% CI 65% to 98%).
The contamination rate of clean-catch samples was lower (5%) than the contamination rate of catheter specimens (8%).


RESULTS
Three hundred and twenty-five patients in Period 1 and 518 patients in Period 2 were included in the study.


METHODS
Clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined, and total and infection-related hospital costs were calculated.

RESULTS
In addition, bacterial eradication was achieved in 41 (87%) of the 47 patients with evaluable data for this outcome.
The median total cost of the hospital stay was $121 718, and the median infection-related cost was $29 697.


RESULTS
The study results elucidated the role and mechanisms that the program leader and other antimicrobial stewards used to influence other clinicians to engage in effective utilization of antimicrobials.


OBJECTIVE
To estimate values of these indicators in Cameroon.

METHODS
The model was fitted using data from a cohort of 351 people in Côte d'Ivoire.


METHODS
Expert consultation and statistics on food poisoning during 2011 were used to identify three common causes of foodborne disease in Japan: Campylobacter and Salmonella species and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC).
We conducted systematic reviews of English and Japanese literature on the complications caused by these pathogens, by searching Embase, the Japan medical society abstract database and Medline.
We then calculated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in 2011, using the incidence estimates along with disability weights derived from published studies.


METHODS
Analyses were restricted to reports published from 1990 onwards.

FINDINGS
We identified 195 reports concerning 192 facilities in 59 countries.
Most were academically-affiliated hospitals in urban areas.
The median mortality within emergency departments was 1.8% (interquartile range, IQR: 0.2-5.1%).
Mortality was relatively high in paediatric facilities (median: 4.8%; IQR: 2.3-8.4%) and in sub-Saharan Africa (median: 3.4%; IQR: 0.5-6.3%).
The median number of patients was 30 000 per year (IQR: 10 296-60 000), most of whom were young (median age: 35 years; IQR: 6.9-41.0) and male (median: 55.7%; IQR: 50.0-59.2%).
Most facilities were staffed either by physicians-in-training or by physicians whose level of training was unspecified.
Very few of these providers had specialist training in emergency care.


METHODS
We analysed cross-sectional data from a survey of evacuees conducted in 2012.
Psychological distress was classified as present or absent based on the K6 scale.
We examined associations between psychological distress and risk perception in logistic regression models.
Age, gender, educational attainment, history of mental illness and the consequences of the disaster for employment and living conditions were potential confounders.

FINDINGS
Similar results were obtained after controlling for individual characteristics and disaster-related stressors.


METHODS
We conducted semi-structured interviews in April 2014 with senior representatives from seven key national organizations involved in pharmaceutical care.
The captured data were coded and analysed using the predetermined themes of pricing, reimbursement, prescribing, dispensing and cost sharing.
We also examined secondary data provided by the Cypriot Ministry of Health; these data included the prices and volumes of prescription medicines in 2013.

FINDINGS
We identified several key issues, including high medicine prices, underuse of generic medicines and high out-of-pocket drug spending.


METHODS
We estimated the baseline intake of TFA before 2004 to be 1.5% of total energy intake.
To calculate the percentage of reduction of CHD, we calculated CHD risks on a population-based sample before and after implementation.
The effect of the policies was modelled in three ways, based on projected changes: (i) in plasma lipid profiles; (ii) in lipid and inflammatory biomarkers; and (iii) the results of prospective cohort studies.
We also estimated the present economic value of DALYs and associated health-care costs of coronary heart disease averted.


FINDINGS
Joinpoint analysis showed large fluctuations in crashes and injuries over time but the fatalities rose almost continuously.
These fluctuations paralleled the country's political and economic development.


RESULTS
The search produced 25 articles, of which 12 duplicates were identified and removed.
Four of the articles analyzed the effects of WBV in children while the other study focused on adults with cerebral palsy.

CONCLUSIONS
It appears that whole body vibration has the potential to provide symptomatic relief for patients with cerebral palsy.
Whole body vibration may improve spasticity, muscle strength and coordination.


RESULTS
The range of percentage agreement on vertebral level selection was 0.36 - 0.79.
The ICC (3,1) was 0.79 (round 1), and 0.70 (round 2).


RESULTS
The response rate was 68.0%.
The most common treatment methods were manual joint manipulation/mobilization, stretching and exercise, posture/ergonomic advice and soft-tissue therapies.


RESULTS
Low, non-significant correlations were found with other variables.
NDI scores were strongly correlated with ranges of motion.

CONCLUSIONS
Modifications to the current version of the TSK-PM might improve its construct validity in future studies.


OBJECTIVE
There are over 250,000 cases of appendicitis annually in the United States.
Of these cases, <50% present with classic signs and symptoms of pain in the right lower quadrant, mild fever and nausea.

CLINICAL FEATURES
On assessment, he was tender with resisted lumbar rotation.
Psoas Sign, McBurney's Point, vascular exam, hip exam, were negative.
A diagnosis of an abdominal strain was provided.
Two weeks later, he returned to the chiropractor without an improvement of symptoms.


RESULTS
Seventeen patients were identified; 76% presented in 2012 and 2013.
In 37.5% of cases, the referring physician suspected Lyme disease.
Only three of 17 patients had a history of erythema migrans and four of 17 recalled a tick bite.


RESULTS
However, use in children <10 years of age decreased by >50% (P<0.001); this was counterbalanced by a steady increase among 15- to 19-year-olds (P<0.0001).


RESULTS
An overview of the main results was presented.
Cancer remains the second highest cause of mortality in Morocco.

CONCLUSION
The data provides a description of the cancer incidence and trends in the Moroccan population.


RESULTS
GFR category G3a CKD was most prevalent stage (9 %).


METHODS
We assessed morbidity in children younger than 5 years by comparing data from the Nouna health district's health management information system before and after the campaign in 2010.
We analysed mortality data from 2008 to 2012 from Nouna's health and demographic surveillance system.

FINDINGS
In 2009, 73% (630/869) of children reportedly slept under nets.
In 2011, 92% (449/487) did.
The campaign had no effect on the proportion of young children with P. falciparum parasitaemia after the rainy season; 52% (442/858) in 2009 and 53% (263/499) in 2011.
Cases of malaria increased markedly after the campaign, as did the number of children presenting with other diseases.
The campaign was not associated with any changes in child mortality.


PROBLEM
The visit of Pope Francis to the Philippines in January 2015 coincided with a tropical storm.
For security reasons, the only road in and out of the area was closed 14.5 hours before the Pope's arrival.
Medical teams in the field reported high numbers of people with cold stress during the mass gathering.

LOCAL SETTING
The key reason for the Pope's visit to Palo and Tacloban was the devastation caused in these cities by typhoon Haiyan in 2013.
We estimated that the visit attracted 300 000 people.


BACKGROUND
Poor semen quality is one of the main causes of infertility.
We have generated a set of monoclonal antibodies to human sperm and used them to investigate sperm quality.
Some of these antibodies found differences in the expression of proteins between normal sperm and pathological sperm displaying severe defects.
One of them was the Hs-14 antibody.

RESULTS
A significant difference (P < 0.001) in immunofluorescence staining with Hs-14 was found between the normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men.


METHODS
We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of US using the intraoperative diagnosis as the gold standard.

CONCLUSION
Ultrasonography is highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing AC.


RESULTS
Our study included 30 patients: 15 in the Braun and 15 in the standard group.
In the Braun group, 4 (26.7%) patients experienced 6 complications, whereas in the standard group, 7 (46.7%) patients experienced 11 complications (p = 0.14).
Complications in the Braun group were gastrointestinal bleeding and wound infection (n = 1 each) and delayed gastric emptying and pulmonary infection (n = 2 each).
Complications in the standard group were death, pancreatic anastomosis leak and biliary anastomosis leak (n = 1 each); gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 2); and afferent loop syndrome and delayed gastric emptying (n = 3 each).
There was no significant difference between groups in the subtypes of complications.


METHODS
We reviewed the surgeries performed in the 4-joint ORs between May and October 2012.
We defined success as 4 joint replacements being completed within the allotted time.

RESULTS
We reviewed 49 4-joint OR days for a total of 196 joint surgeries.
Of the 49 days, 24 (49%) were successful.
Only 2 surgeons had a success rate greater than 50%.
We calculated probabilities for each component and derived benchmark times corresponding to the probability of 0.60.
These benchmarks were APT of 9 min, SPT of 14 min, procedure duration of 68 min, AFT of 4 min and turnover of 15 min.


METHODS
All patients with clinical stage I and II NSCLC who underwent surgical resection in a single centre between January 2010 and December 2011 were reviewed.
Analysis was stratified based on preoperative clinical stage.
We assessed the effect of wait time on survival using a Cox proportional hazard model with wait time in months as a categorical variable.
Incidence of upstaging at least 1 stage was assessed using logistic regression.

RESULTS
We identified 222 patients: 180 were stage I and 42 were stage II.
For stage I, wait times up to 4 months had no significant effect on survival or incidence of upstaging.
For those waiting between 1 and 2 months, there was no significant difference in survival or upstaging.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the potential effects of betel quid chewing on mortality.

METHODS
Prospective data were available on 20 033 individuals aged 18-75 years, living in Araihazar, Bangladesh.
Demographic and exposure data were collected at baseline using a standardized questionnaire.
Cause of death was defined by verbal autopsy questionnaires administered to next of kin.
We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between betel use and mortality from all causes and from specific causes, using Cox proportional hazards models.
We adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, educational attainment and tobacco smoking history.


METHODS
We analysed applications submitted to the WHO Expert Committee on the Selection and Use of Essential Medicines between 2002 and 2013.

FINDINGS
The expert committee received 134 applications.
Only eight applications (6%) included complete price data and economic evaluation data.
Many applicants omitted or misinterpreted the economic evaluation section of the application form.
Despite the lack of economic data, all applications were reviewed by the committee.
There was no significant association between the completeness of economic information and application outcomes.


METHODS
For potentially relevant articles that lacked paediatric outcomes, we contacted the authors of the studies.
We assessed heterogeneity and risk of bias.
To evaluate treatment success - i.e. the combination of treatment completion and cure - we performed random-effects meta-analysis.
We identified areas of need for improved intervention practices.

FINDINGS
The children in intervention arms had higher rates of treatment success, compared with those in control groups (odds ratio: 3.02; 95% confidence interval: 2.19-4.15).


RESULTS
Consensus was reached by the residents regarding five low-value practices within the purview of infectious diseases and microbiology physicians.
After the retreat, 20 participants (32%) completed the follow-up survey.


RESULTS
During this period, a 20.0% increase in PD and an essentially stable absolute count of DOT (2.9% decrease) were observed.


RESULTS
Ninety of 132 (68%) BAL fluid samples were collected from immunocompromised patients.
Thirteen of 92 (14%) BALs collected were PJ+ when tested using IFA.
A total of 40 BAL samples were PJ+ in the present study including: all IFA positive samples (n=13); all referred PJ+ BAL samples (n=20); and seven additional BAL samples that were IFA negative, but positive using the modified gold standard.
Compared with IFA, the PJ real-time PCR had sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, 91%, 65% and 100%, respectively.
Compared with the modified gold standard, PJ real-time PCR had a sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%.


RESULTS
The outbreak cases were comprised of 89% men.


RESULTS
A total of 32 articles were included.

CONCLUSION
Articles using CIS data were rated positively on most quality indicators.
Data from the CIS oversamples have been underutilized.
The use of multivariate analysis techniques has increased.


RESULTS
Twenty-six percent of young mothers were 18 years or younger.
Most (68% of teen-mother families and 57% of families with a young adult mother) received social assistance as their main source of income compared with 36% of families with a mother aged 22 years or older.
Secondary caregivers in families with young mothers also had more risk factors.
All were equally likely to be victims of domestic violence and to have mental health issues.


RESULTS
Adaptation of the NFP home-visit materials is a continuous process.
A pilot project determined that it was feasible to enrol eligible women into the NFP.
Finally, the pilot showed that this intensive home-visit program was acceptable to clients, their family members and health care providers.
Through the BCHCP, the next steps - the RCT and process evaluation - are currently underway.
The BCHCP will also set the foundation for long-term evaluation of key public health outcomes in a highly vulnerable population of families.


RESULTS
Triglycerides but not total cholesterol, HDL -cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol increased with higher CKD stage.
Decreased levels of total testosterone and estimated free testosterone levels had a significant correlation with an increased level of triglyceride levels (p <0.01).


RESULTS
Pre-post course tests reflected an increase in knowledge.


RESULTS
Ten Canadian plastic surgery program directors responded (90.9% response rate).
Applicants invited for interview were assessed on the quality of their responses to questions, maturity and personality.
Program directors were neutral on their satisfaction with the selection process.


RESULTS
There was no difference in heart rate or mean arterial pressure between groups at the end of the operation.


RESULTS
A total of 157 determinations were analyzed from 17 severe burn injury patients.
Fifty-four samples were considered to be septic, 25 of which corresponded to the first day of a new onset of sepsis.
The mean duration of these symptoms was four days (interquartile range two to five days).
Significant differences were found in the distributions of CRP and PCT values between sepsis and no-sepsis samples.
Analysis of the changes in these biomarkers over time showed that PCT increase (ΔPCT) differentiated these diagnoses, whereas CRP increase (ΔCRP) did not.
ROC curve analysis revealed that ΔPCT could predict positive sepsis samples (area under the curve 0.75 [95% CI 0.58 to 0.90]; P=0.003).

CONCLUSION
A larger sample size would be needed to confirm these results.


RESULTS
Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis.
Mean (± SD) age was 16.9±1.1 years and mean body mass index was 28.9±6.1 kg/m(2).
Mean intraoperative lung compliance improvement was 23.92% (95% CI 8.3% to 37%; P=0.001).


RESULTS
Total volume of FFP transfusion was reduced by 46% (P=0.002) and postoperative FFP transfusion was reduced by 100% (P=0.001).
The use of TXA was associated with a lower total volume of PRBC (P=0.003) and FFP (P=0.003) transfusions.


RESULTS
Of 100 patients, three had a cartilaginous dorsal spur as the cephalic edge of the graft became visible.
One patient developed an ecchymosis along the dorsum that caused a hump that resolved in two months.
There were no other aesthetic or functional complications.


RESULTS
Nine studies representing 4747 free abdominal flaps cases were included and demonstrated an overall incidence of intraoperative venous congestion of 2.8%.
The incidence in DIEP flaps (3.3%) was significantly higher than that in the free TRAM flaps (1.0%).


RESULTS
Ten studies (255 patients) were included.
However, the methodological heterogeneity of the included studies, the lack of control group in the majority of them, the use of subjective scales of measurement and the frequent use of patient self-assessment precluded unbiased results.


FINDINGS
We registered 4569 subjects in the cohort.
Overall, the cohort had an SMR for deaths from all causes of 5.2 (95% confidence interval, CI: 4.8-5.6).
Males had a higher SMR than females (6.1 versus 3.0).
The risk of death from tuberculosis was also significantly greater for previously treated people (HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.24-2.86) and smear positive people (HR: 3.16; 95% CI: 2.06-4.87).

CONCLUSION
People with tuberculosis in Shanghai have an increased risk of mortality.


METHODS
Between July 2012 and July 2013, we carried out a randomized controlled trial of the Youth Readiness
Intervention
--a cognitive-behavioural intervention for war-affected young people who exhibit depressive and anxiety symptoms and conduct problems--in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
We used a burden assessment scale to evaluate the burden of care placed on caregivers in terms of emotional distress and functional impairment.
The caregivers' mental health--i.e. internalizing, externalizing and prosocial behaviour--was evaluated using the Oxford Measure of Psychosocial Adjustment.
Difference-in-differences multiple regression analyses were used, within an intention-to-treat framework, to estimate the treatment effects.


METHODS
The primary outcome was the self-reported use of an effective contraceptive method, 4 and 12 months after an abortion.

FINDINGS
Data on effective contraceptive use were available for 431 (86%) participants at 4 months and 328 (66%) at 12 months.
There was no significant difference between the groups in repeat pregnancies or abortions at 4 or 12 months.


METHODS
We interviewed community members about their exposure to traditional and non-traditional marketing in the previous six months.
To examine differences in marketing between urban and rural communities and between high-, middle- and low-income countries, we used multilevel regression models controlling for potential confounders.

FINDINGS
Of the 11,842 interviewees, 1184 (10%) reported seeing at least five types of tobacco marketing.
For almost all measures, marketing exposure was significantly lower in the rural communities than in the urban communities.


APPROACH
In October 2011, the Government of Paraíba, Brazil, established a paediatric cardiology network in partnership with the nongovernmental organization Círculo do Coração.
A cardiology team supervised all network activities, using the Internet to keep in contact with remote health facilities.
The network developed protocols for screening heart defects.
Echocardiograms were performed by physicians under direct online supervision of a cardiologist; alternatively, a video recording of the examination was subsequently reviewed by a cardiologist.
Cardiovascular surgeons came to a paediatric hospital in the state capital once a week to perform heart surgeries.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Detection of congenital heart diseases increased from 4.09 to 11.62 per 1000 live births (P < 0.001).
Over 6000 consultations and echocardiograms were supervised via the Internet.
Time to diagnosis, transfers and hospital stays were greatly reduced.
A total of 330 operations were carried out with 6.7% (22/330) mortality.


RESULTS
The two groups were similar at baseline, with non-adherence identified in 43.75 % of patients.


RESULTS
The ability to compare two similar products was found to be significantly better when the tVN included a standardized reference portion (p = 0.001 in all cases).

CONCLUSION
Further research is needed to replicate this study in a more heterogeneous sample in Canada and across a range of food products and categories.


RESULTS
In 2012/2013, the crude prevalence of CHD was 9.4% with the first definition (593 000 people).


RESULTS
None of these parameters displayed both a good sensitivity and specificity.


METHODS
A retrospective descriptive study was conducted at the Veterans Centre, a long-term care facility at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario.
Antibiotic-use data for patients residing in the facility between April 1, 2011, and March 31, 2012, were collected and analyzed.

RESULTS
For 36% (302/835) of antibiotic prescriptions, the duration was more than 7 days.
Cephalosporins (30%; 251/835) and fluoroquinolones (28%; 235/835) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotic classes.


RESULTS
A total of 331 patients, born between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2008, were identified.
Prevalence rates were also calculated for anemia (22.8%), iron deficiency (53.3%), hepatitis B (2.5%), parasitic infections (33.6%), elevated blood lead levels (4.9%) and HIV (0%).
Neighbourhood income quintiles revealed that 46.7% of patients were residing in the lowest (ie, poorest) income quintile neighbourhoods.


RESULTS
Service provision varied across provinces and over time.


RESULTS
Fidaxomicin is the first macrocyclic lactone antibiotic with activity versus C difficile.
It inhibits RNA polymerase, therefore, preventing transcription.
Fidaxomicin (and its active metabolite OP-1118) is bactericidal against C difficile and exhibits a prolonged postantibiotic effect (approximately 10 h).
Other than for C difficile, fidaxomicin demonstrated only moderate inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria and was a poor inhibitor of normal colonic flora, including anaerobes and enteric Gram-negative bacilli.
Fidaxomicin was, however, reported to be superior to oral vancomycin in reducing recurrent CDI and achieving a sustained clinical response (assessed at day 28) for patients infected with non-BI/NAP1/027 strains.

CONCLUSION
Fidaxomicin was noninferior to oral vancomycin with regard to clinical response at the end of CDI therapy.


RESULTS
The literature search yielded 46 publications, comprising 72 cases from the English (n=30), French (n=1), Spanish (n=1) and Japanese (n=14) literature.
Five cases at the Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital were also included.
Of the included 77 cases, the mean age was 61 years and 39% of patients were female; 77.2% of the cases occurred between June and November, and 45.5% were reported in Japan.
The overall mortality rate was 44.6%; however, this rate increased to 61.1% for ETB patients with soft tissue infections.


RESULTS
Twenty-five separate patient encounters were assessed.
Twelve patients were found to be volume overloaded while 13 were euvolemic.


METHODS
We distinguished between anencephaly, encephalocele, meningocele, myelomeningocele and other forms of spina bifida.

FINDINGS
There were 8554 neural tube defects for 17,925,729 live births notified between 2001 and 2014.
For the same period, 2673 neural tube defects were reported for 194,858 stillbirths.
The corresponding values among live births were 0.57 and 0.44, respectively.


METHODS
In 2010, we checked the records of all visits to five private hospitals that are estimated to cover 63% of all foreign patients.
We reviewed hospital records of foreign patients and obtained data on their countries of origin, diagnoses and interventions.
We surveyed 293 medical tourists to collect demographic characteristics and information on their expenditure and travelling companions.
To help understand the impact of medical tourism on the Thai health system, we also interviewed 15 hospital executives and 28 service providers from the private hospitals.

FINDINGS
We obtained 911,913 records of hospital visits, of which 324,906 came from 104,830 medical tourists.
We estimated that there were 167,000 medical tourists in Thailand in 2010.
Of the medical tourists who attended our study hospitals, 67,987 (64.8%) came from the eastern Mediterranean region or Asia and 109,509 (34%) of them were treated for simple and uncomplicated conditions - i.e. general check-ups and medical consultations.
The mean self-reported non-medical expenditure was 2750 United States dollars.
According to the hospital staff interviewed, medical tourism in 2010 brought benefits to - and apparently had no negative impacts on - the Thai health system and economy.


FINDINGS
S. haematobium was detected in 287/3514 school children (adjusted prevalence: 8.76%, range across sentinel sites: 0.0-56.3%; median: 2.5%).
Schistosoma mansoni was only detected in two regions and 43 children - i.e. 1 (0.31%) of the 320 from Centre-Sud and 42 (8.75%) of the 480 from Hauts Bassins.


APPROACH
Retention of health workers is critical to the delivery of long-term, quality health-care services.
To promote retention and enhance performance in rural public hospitals, the Government of Nepal and the Nick Simons Institute progressively implemented a rural staff support programme in remote hospitals.

RELEVANT CHANGES
Between 2011 and 2015 family practice doctors were maintained in all seven programme hospitals.
All hospitals became providers of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and served more patients.
Compared with hospitals not within the programme, deliveries increased significantly (203% versus 71% increase, respectively; P = 0.002).
The programme recently expanded to 14 hospitals.


INTRODUCTION
The Mental Health Strategy for Canada identified a need to enhance the collection of data on mental health in Canada.


METHODS
Univariate analysis was performed using the χ² test.

RESULTS
Gastroenterologists (n = 69) reported using anatomical landmarks (91.3%), tattooing (82.6%) and image capture (73.9%) for tumour localization.
The majority said they would tattoo lesions that could not be removed by colonoscopy (91.3%), high-risk polyps (95.7%) and large lesions (84.1%).
They were equally likely to tattoo lesions planned for laparoscopic (91.3%) or open (88.4%) resection.
Rectal lesions were less likely to be tattooed (20.3%) than left-sided (89.9%) or right-sided (85.5%) lesions.
Only 1.4% agreed that repeat endoscopy is the standard of care, whereas 38.9% (n = 68) of general surgeons agreed (p < 0.001).
General surgeons were more likely to agree that an incomplete initial colonoscopy was an indication for repeat endoscopy (p = 0.040).
Further, 56% of general surgeons indicated that the findings of repeat endoscopy often lead to changes in the operative plan.


RESULTS
Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK.


RESULTS
More than 66% of respondents reported a musculoskeletal disorder that was related to work; the most common was low back pain (29.3%).
The number of body regions involved and disorders diagnosed was associated with increasing age and number of years in practice (p = 0.033).


METHODS
We reviewed patients with cobalt-chrome or oxidized zirconium on highly crosslinked polyethylene who were followed prospectively between 2004 and 2012.

RESULTS
A total of 622 patients were followed during the study period.
Mean follow-up was 8.2 (range 2.0-10.6) years for cobalt-chrome and 7.8 (range 2.1-10.7) years for oxidized zirconium.
Mean age was 54.9 ± 10.6 years for cobalt-chrome and 54.8 ± 10.7 years for oxidized zirconium.
An age-, sex- and diagnosis-matched comparison of the HHS, WOMAC and SF-12 scores demonstrated no significant changes in clinical outcomes across the groups.


INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
The athlete was able to return to normal pitching duties approximately 12 months later.


RESULTS
New patient consultations were primarily referrals from other health providers internal to the MCC (71.2%), frequently primary care physicians (76%).


RESULTS
Questionnaires were completed by 554 respondents.
Most respondents (>75%) held positive attitudes toward EBP.

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the low response rate.


METHODS
Paired reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility.

RESULTS
We identified two randomized trials with a low risk of bias.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A 21-year-old provincial basketball player presented with recurrent radiating low back pain into the left groin and lower limb.

SUMMARY
Knowing when to refer for advanced imaging and/or a surgical consult given the variable clinical presentation and prognosis is an essential component to care.


SUMMARY
Research quality concerning the non-surgical management of inguinal disruption remains low.


SUMMARY
FAI is prevalent in ice hockey players, particularly with goaltenders.


CLINICAL FEATURES
There was minor swelling and bruising.

INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
Plain film radiographs revealed a Salter-Harris type II fracture of the 2(nd) proximal phalanx.
Her toe was stabilized and she was referred to an orthopedist.
Orthopedic management involved a taping procedure.


RESULTS
The mean age of patients in ED group was 60.4 ± 11.3 years and 55.4 ± 9.6 in control group.


INTRODUCTION
This is partly due to the difficulty of attracting and retaining physicians.

METHODS
We used interpretive description to analyze interview responses.


INTRODUCTION
In Canada, most LIC experiences are situated in rural communities.
We sought to determine the impact of rural LICs in terms of practice location of graduates.

METHODS
We used the χ(2) test to assess the association between type of clerkship stream and practice location.


Title
Socioeconomic gradients in cardiovascular risk in Canadian children and adolescents.

RESULTS
Young boys showed markedly higher prevalence of obesity than young girls (prevalence of 18.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.6-21.5 vs. 7.7%, 95% CI: 5.2-10.3).
However, negative SES gradients in adiposity risk were seen in young and adolescent girls rather than boys.
Although a positive income gradient in AFS was observed in both boys and girls, statistical significance was reached only in girls (p =.
While we observed substantial sex differences in systolic BP, total and HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose and CRP in adolescents, sex-specific socioeconomic gradients were only observed for systolic BP, HDL and LDL cholesterol.
Further studies with large samples are needed to confirm these findings.


RESULTS
The prevalence of MetS was 2.1%.

CONCLUSION
One-third of Canadian children and adolescents have at least one risk factor for MetS.


RESULTS
The APD patients had a median age of 37.5 years, were predominantly female (72.7 %), and had a median body mass index (BMI) of 23.8 kg/m2.
No other comparisons of sleep parameters among groups reached statistical significance.


METHODS
Post freezing and thawing semen characteristics were also studied.

RESULTS
The percentage of normozoospermic men was only 37 % for L patients and lower than 60 % for TGCT, NHL, S and BT.
The percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa was also reduced in cancer patients, especially in BT patients.
Progressive motility after thawing in patients was about half that observed among candidates for sperm donation.


METHODS
The survey comprised four yes-no questions and two supplementary questions.
A mortality review committee established the cause of death.

FINDINGS
Survey results were available for 357 women of reproductive age who died in the district.
The most common causes of death were haemorrhage (15) and abortion (14).
The resulting maternal mortality ratio was 357 per 100 000 live births, compared with 128 per 100 000 live births derived from hospital records.


METHODS
We visited indoor and outdoor locations in bars/nightclubs, cafes, government buildings, hospitals, restaurants, schools, shopping malls, traditional coffee houses and universities.
We used logistic regression models to determine the association between the presence of ashtrays or the absence of no-smoking signs and the presence of individuals smoking or cigarette butts.

FINDINGS
Most venues had no-smoking signs (629/884).
We observed at least one person smoking in 145 venues, most frequently observed in bars/nightclubs (63/79), hospital dining areas (18/79), traditional coffee houses (27/120) and government-building dining areas (5/23).
For 538 venues, we observed outdoor smoking close to public buildings.
The presence of ashtrays was positively associated with indoor smoking and cigarette butts, adjusted odds ratio, aOR: 315.9; 95% confidence interval, CI: 174.9-570.8 and aOR: 165.4; 95% CI: 98.0-279.1, respectively.
No-smoking signs were negatively associated with the presence of cigarette butts, aOR: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8.


CONCLUSION
An interprofessional tracheostomy team can improve the quality of tracheostomy care through earlier tracheostomy tube changes and swallowing assessment referrals.
To validate the findings from this particular institution, a more rigorous quality improvement methodology should be considered in addition to strategies to improve protocol compliance.


CONCLUSION
The OxyMask outperformed the traditional NRBM in each tested category.


RESULTS
Thirty-six relevant RCTs were obtained.
Six ISy parameters were identified in ISy prescriptions from these trials.
Almost all (97.2%) of the trials had ISy prescriptions with specific parameters.
Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the ISy parameters assessed were significantly lower (Z=-5.433; P<0.001) than those prescribed; 66.7% of the trials indicated use of various methods to assess these parameters.
Only six (16.7%) trials included reports on compliance; however, these were also incomprehensive.


RESULTS
A total of 511 charts were reviewed and 367 LPIs were eligible for inclusion.

CONCLUSION
Twenty-six percent of LPIs failed car seat testing.
Ideally, infants should be tested after an appropriate transitional period.
The authors identified factors that may be important in designing future, prospective studies in this area.


RESULTS
A total of 272 preterm infants were included in the study: 129 in the preguideline cohort and 143 in the postguideline cohort.
There was no difference in the proportion of infants treated with surfactant (54% versus 50%).


INTRODUCTION
However, the magnitude of data loss is largely unknown.

RESULTS
The cohort consisted of 12 394 individuals; 86.4% had a prescription for a diabetes medication from an FFS physician.
A total of 1172 physicians (81.8% FFS) prescribed these medications for the cohort.


METHODS
We also completed in-depth interviews with five family caregivers of elderly people with dementia.

FINDINGS
They lacked both clinical staff and standardized, evidence-based practices for the diagnosis, care, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with dementia.
As care facilities often refused to admit elderly people with dementia, families were generally forced to care for elderly relatives with dementia at home.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the validity of the GLOBOCAN methods for deriving national estimates of cancer incidence.

METHODS
We obtained incidence and mortality data from Norway by region, year of diagnosis, cancer site, sex and 5-year age group for the period 1983-2012 from the NORDCAN database.
Estimates for the year 2010 were derived using nine different methods from GLOBOCAN.
We then compared the national estimates with recorded cancer incidence data.


METHODS
For the 194 Member States of the World Health Organization, we searched PubMed for studies and contacted key informants for reports on surgical volumes between 2005 and 2012.
Data on caesarean delivery were obtained from validated statistical reports.
We estimated caesarean deliveries as a proportion of all surgery.

FINDINGS
We identified 66 Member States reporting surgical data.
We estimated that 312.9 million operations (95% confidence interval, CI: 266.2-359.5) took place in 2012, an increase from the 2004 estimate of 226.4 million operations.


LOCAL SETTING
The expanding HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men is a public health problem in China.
HIV control and prevention measures are implemented primarily through the public system.

LESSONS LEARNT
Collaboration between the public sector and the community group promoted acceptance by the target population.
Task sharing by community groups can increase access of this high-risk group to available HIV-related services.


METHODS
The primary outcome was the volume in which each acyclovir dose was delivered.
The secondary outcomes were the hourly rate of fluid administration, the frequency of an increase in hourly hydration rate, and the incidence of acute kidney injury.


METHODS
An e-mail invitation was sent to members of the Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists (n = 2499) in November 2012.

RESULTS
A total of 367 pharmacists completed the survey.
Most of the respondents were women (258 [70%]), had more than 10 years in practice (213 [58%]), and were providing care to 1 or more osteoporosis patients per week (212 [58%]).
Forty-eight percent (176/363) agreed that oral bisphosphonates could be used for patients with renal failure (defined as CrCl < 30 mL/min), so long as dosage adjustments are made.
More than half (206/363 [57%]) believed that the adverse effects of oral bisphosphonates increase for patients with renal failure.


RESULTS
The mean age of the participants was 72 years, and the mean length of participation was 8 years.


RESULTS
A total of 665 participants completed the survey.


METHODS
Descriptive and comparative analyses of the 2 historical cohorts were performed.

RESULTS
A total of 1040 brain-dead organ donors were included in our analysis: 496 from the 2000-2005 period and 544 from the 2006-2012 period.


METHODS
We conducted univariate and Kaplan-Meier survivorship analyses.

RESULTS
During the 9-year study period, 108 consecutive patients underwent laser lead extractions (218 leads extracted).
The most common indication for extraction was infection (84.3%).
No minor complications required surgical intervention.
Survival after discharge was 98.4% at 30 days and 94% at 12 months.


RESULTS
We interviewed 20 patients before achieving data saturation.
Three major themes emerged.
First, family was considered as a crucial adjunct to the patient-provider dyad.


RESULTS
All patients recovered and were discharged home.


METHODS
Detailed patient-level data were collected regarding demographics, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.
We examined the association between complications, hospital mortality and loss of independence cost using multiple linear regression.

RESULTS
During the study period 212 patients underwent surgery.
Overall, 51.9% of patients experienced a nonfatal complication (32.5% minor and 19.4% major), 6.6% died in hospital and 22.6% experienced a loss of independence.


RESULTS
During 10,221 patient-years of follow-up, 1493/5336 patients died.
Similar results were noted with several different analytic methods and for all pre-specified subgroups.


METHODS
We determined surgery duration using anesthesiology billing records.


METHODS
A conditional logit regression model was used to estimate the relative preference and willingness to pay for each attribute.

RESULTS
Sixty-two respondents completed the questionnaire.
Three of the 4 attributes significantly influenced treatment preferences.


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 263 patients who underwent thyroid surgery between 2009 and 2013.

RESULTS
A total of 136 cases of thyroid cancer in 120 patients met the inclusion criteria for ultrasound mapping analysis.
The PPVs (and 95% confidence intervals) were 83.82 (0.76-0.89) for the lateral and central compartments, 85.39% (0.76-0.91) for the lateral compartment, and 80.48% (0.7-0.87) for the central compartment.


METHODS
Translation was performed according to American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2000 guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation.
We then recruited patients with ankle OA for evaluation of the AOS-Fr psychometric properties.

RESULTS
Twenty-eight patients with ankle OA participated in the evaluation.


RESULTS
Of 1422 deceased donor kidney transplants, 325 (23 %) were from ECDs.
The median donor age was 63 vs. 42 years for ECD vs. non-ECD, respectively.


RESULTS
A total of four patients reportedly discontinued gabapentin due to intolerability.


METHODS
The same set of questions was also used in focus group discussions led by the global reference group.

CONCLUSION
The sexual and reproductive health needs and rights of women living with HIV are complex and require a stronger response from the health sector.
Although not possible in some contexts and populations, a similar approach would merit replication in the development of guidelines for many other health considerations.


METHODS
The results were summarized by income group and region.

FINDINGS
According to our model, the tax increase would lead the mean retail price of cigarettes to increase by 42%--from 3.20 to 4.55 I$ per 20-cigarette pack.
This, in turn, could help create the fiscal space required to finance development priorities.
For example, if the extra revenue was allocated to health budgets, public expenditure on health could increase by 4% globally.


CONCLUSION
Specifically, vendors with medical training could participate in task-shifting interventions.


FINDINGS
The weighted proportion of participants with access to basic chronic care ranged from 20.6% in Mexico to 47.6% in South Africa.
Access rates were unequally distributed and disadvantaged poor people, except in South Africa where primary health care is free to all.
Rural residence did not affect access.
The proportion with catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure for the last outpatient visit ranged from 14.5% in China to 54.8% in Ghana.
Financial hardship was more common among the poor in most countries but affected all income groups.
Health insurance generally increased access to care but gave insufficient protection against financial hardship.

CONCLUSION
No country provided access to basic chronic care for more than half of the participants with chronic illness.
The poor were less likely to receive care and more likely to face financial hardship in most countries.
However, inequity of access was not fully determined by the level of economic development or insurance coverage.
Future health reforms should aim to improve service quality and increase democratic oversight of health care.


RESULTS
The mean age for healthy subjects and ESRD patients was 45 ± 12 and 63 ± 16 years, respectively.


RESULTS
Twenty five subjects were randomized to either continued treatment with citalopram (n = 12) versus placebo (n = 13).
Seventy-five percent of subjects on citalopram (75%) remained well as compared to placebo (62%).
Time to relapse was compared between groups using the log rank test and was not found to be significantly different (χ(2)(1) = 0.35, P = 0.55).

CONCLUSION
A larger clinical trial with adequate power is required to confirm or disconfirm these findings.


OBJECTIVE
Presence of Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) can be extremely frustrating for a child.
The present study aimed to assess the levels of resilience, depression, anxiety and stress among children and adolescents having SLD and to compare with those having Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF).
It also aimed to evaluate the parental awareness about their child's learning disorder.


RESULTS
The preliminary findings show statistically significant improvements in attachment, communication, discipline practices, involvement, and relational frustration.

CONCLUSION
Poor quality or inconsistent interactions with early caregivers can lead to life-long impairments in physical and mental health.
This intensive program shows potential as a way to improve longer-term outcomes for children exposed to early developmental trauma.


RESULTS
Alcohol interacts with serotonergic synaptic transmission in several ways, and the reduced availability of serotonin transporters might foster brain dysfunction, driving to alcohol abuse.
The initial use of ethanol in children and adolescents is determined primarily by environmental influences, whereas the establishment of drinking patterns is strongly controlled by genetic factors.
Functional polymorphic variants in the promoter region of the 5-HTTLPR gene have age-dependent effects in alcohol abuse.
This polymorphism, mapped to the 5' region of the SLC6A4, is a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and involves a direct repeat of 20-23 base pairs GC-rich sequences, comprising a short (S) allele, consisting of 14 repeats, and a long (L) allele, with 16 repeats.
Additional variants have been described, although their influences on childhood and adolescence ethanol use are not clear.


RESULTS
All studies reported no increase in seizure rates in a majority of participants after exposure to MPH.
MPH was effective in treating ADHD symptoms.


PARTICIPANTS
Descriptive statistics and associations between demographic factors and barriers and facilitators to care will be analyzed using regression models.


RESULTS
The difference in flap salvage rate was not significant (ID 90.9%, ED 63.6%; P=0.068).
The false-positive (ID 0%, ED 3%; P=0.18) and false-negative rates (ID 0.0%, ED 4.5%; P=1.0) were not significantly different.


RESULTS
All patients exhibited increased AROM after surgery for both MCP and PIP joints.
Both groups had a greater increase in AROM in the MCP joint.
Twelve joints from the control group had moderate changes and two from the treatment group had significant changes.


CONCLUSION
Smart phones are commonly used to obtain clinical photographs in plastic surgery.


RESULTS
Pain during the anesthesia and discomfort after the procedure were minimal.
Complications included ecchymoses and prolonged edema.
The mean (± SD) arm circumference decreased 5.5±1.0 cm in the right arm (P<0.01) and 5.2±1.1 cm in the left arm (P<0.01) in grade III patients and 4.9±1.1 cm in the right arm (P<0.01) and 4.9±1.1 cm in the left arm (P<0.01) in grade IV patients.
Of the 22 patients, only nine (41%) would recommend this treatment.


RESULTS
960 of 2,677 deliverable questionnaires were completed (36% response rate).
The majority of respondents favoured limited prescribing rights for chiropractors regardless of college of graduation.
Respondents who graduated from Canadian institutions were significantly more in favour of these privileges compared to graduates from non-Canadian schools.
Over three-quarters of all respondents opposed the idea of chiropractors having full prescribing rights.
No significant association was found between respondents' philosophical orientation and school attended.


RESULTS
The search identified 13 articles, one judged high quality, satisfying the inclusion criteria.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Improved methods should be sought.


CLINICAL FEATURES
His breathing was laboured and his dry cough aggravating.
After assessment a high clinical suspicion of primary spontaneous pneumothorax prevailed.

CONCLUSIONS
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is a medical emergency in the presence of shortness of breath.
The focus of treatment is to drain air from the pleural linings and to prevent recurrences.
In less severe cases, patients may believe they have thoracic spine pain and seek manual therapy care.
This case highlights the important role chiropractors have as primary contact health care providers.


CLINICAL FEATURES
After a physical exam that was relatively unremarkable, imaging identified a burst fracture in the cervical spine.

SUMMARY
The screening tools were non-diagnostic.
This identified a pathological burst fracture in the C4 vertebrae.


INTRODUCTION
The current paucity of research results also precludes the thoughtful design of a controlled, prospective clinical study.


RESULTS
Forty-five new patients were recruited.
Twenty-one participants were interviewed.


RESULTS
Eleven systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria.
Seven reviews reported mixed effects on health outcomes and healthy behaviours.
However, some targeted studies reported that social media interventions were effective in specific populations in terms of age, socioeconomic status, ethnicities and place of residence.
Four reviews reported qualitative benefits such as satisfaction, finding information and improved social support.

CONCLUSION
However, confirmation of effectiveness would require further study.
Several reviews raised the issue of acceptability of social media interventions.
Only four studies reported on the level of intervention use and all of these reported low use.


RESULTS
While B.C. has lower prevalence rates of the risk factors than any other Canadian province, there is significant variation within the province.


OBJECTIVE
Factors associated with change in knowledge were also examined.


RESULTS
A total of 50 joint fluid specimens were submitted over the study period.
Ten were culture-positive, eight for S aureus and two for S pyogenes.
Residual joint fluid was available for 27 of the 40 culture-negative specimens and K kingae was detected using PCR in seven (25.93%) of these samples.


RESULTS
A total of 2145 drug prescriptions were extracted on March 5, 2014, for inclusion in the present study.


RESULTS
The median calcium loss was 0.8 mmol/h dialyzed in both groups (p = 0.43), and end of treatment ionized calcium was the same in both groups (1.07 ± 0.04 mmol/L).


RESULTS
Of those not exposed to an ESA, 15 % (48/319) developed NODAT.


FINDINGS
The national stillbirth rate declined from 9.2 to 7.2 per 1000 births between 2000 and 2013 (i.e. -1.9% per year).
The prevalence of stillbirths varied 3.9-fold between states.
Overall, 51% (7348/14 344) of fetal deaths occurred intrapartum.

CONCLUSION
In Mexico, the total stillbirth rate declined between 2000 and 2013, however geographical variations were observed.
Stillbirths were associated with sociodemographic factors.


METHODS
We used random effects meta-analysis to generate regional and overall pooled estimates.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate risk ratios for the associated risk factors.
Population attributable fractions were estimated based on adjusted risk ratios and the prevalence of the determinants within each exposure level.

FINDINGS
Factors associated with suicidal ideation in most countries included experiences of bullying and physical violence, loneliness, limited parental support and alcohol and tobacco use.


FINDINGS
Successful policy and programme approaches were categorized in four strategic areas: leadership and multistakeholder partnerships; health sector; sectors outside health; and accountability for resources and results.
Consistent and coordinated inputs across sectors, based on high-impact interventions, were assessed.
Within the health sector, key policy and programme strategies included defining standards, collecting and using data, improving financial protection, and improving the availability and quality of services.
Outside the health sector, strategies included investing in girls' education, water, sanitation and hygiene, poverty reduction, nutrition and food security, and infrastructure development.
Countries improved accountability by strengthening and using data systems for planning and evaluating progress.


METHODS
We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study using the 2006-2013 Búsqueda intencionada y reclasificación de muertes maternas (BIRMM) data set.
We used frequencies to describe new cases, cause distributions and the reclassification of maternal mortality cases by the BIRMM process.
We used statistical tests to analyse differences in sociodemographic characteristics between direct and indirect deaths and differences in the proportion of overall direct and indirect deaths, by year and by municipality poverty level.

FINDINGS
There was a 13% increase (from 7829 to 9043) in overall identified maternal deaths and a threefold increase in the proportion of maternal deaths classified as late maternal deaths (from 2.1% to 6.9%).
Over the study period direct obstetric deaths declined, while there was no change in deaths from indirect obstetric causes.
Direct deaths were concentrated in women who lived in the poorest municipalities.


LOCAL SETTING
The training took place in CB Dunbar Maternity Hospital.
In February 2015 there were just 117 doctors available in Liberia.


RELEVANT CHANGES
In February 2014, the helpline was launched across Gujarat.

LESSONS LEARNT
However, for evaluating the impact of the helpline, the operational definitions of concern categories need to be further clarified.


RESULTS
A total of 769 valid survey responses were received.
Among the respondents, 44.6% (333/747) agreed that marijuana is safe, whereas 55.2% (411/745) agreed that it is effective.


RESULTS
The search strategy generated 113 results.
Further refinement resulted in 14 English-language articles that met the inclusion criteria.
Four of these articles focused on adapting the Basel statements to European practice, an initiative of the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists that led to development of the European statements of Hospital Pharmacy.
Six studies focused on monitoring hospital pharmacy practice in Uganda, the Pacific island countries, and the Western Pacific Region.
These studies provide valuable baseline data to measure and track the development of hospital pharmacy practices in their respective countries and regions.
The remaining 4 studies used qualitative methods to explore the barriers to and facilitators of implementation of the Basel statements in South Africa, China, and Australia.

CONCLUSION
The European and Western Pacific regions have been the most active.


RESULTS
Of the 6046 injuries (0.72% of events in this age group) that occurred during work, 63.9% were among males.
These were largely driven by high proportional incidence of injury types unique to job groups.


RESULTS
Five hundred ninety-two Canadian nephrologists were contacted and 48 % responded, with representation from all Canadian provinces.
One third of the respondents were female, and the largest age cohort was 41-50 years.
Nephrology division heads forecasted the number of clinical and academic nephrologists needed for the next 3 and 5 years.

LIMITATIONS
The response rate was 48 %.


CONCLUSION
Morbidity and mortality due to sigmoid diverticulitis is significantly higher in immunosuppressed patients.


CONCLUSION
All procedures were safe.


RESULTS
A concurrent increase in the number of inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography/magnetic resonance imaging performed was observed (p = 0.040).


RESULTS
A total of 275 children were treated during the study period.
The mean age at admission was 12 ± 4.5 years, and the male:female ratio was 1.4:1.
The top 3 mechanisms of spinal injury were motor vehicle-related trauma (53%), sports (28%) and falls (13%).
Myelopathy occurred in 12% and SCIWORA occurred in 6%.
The most common spine levels injured were L2-sacrum, followed by O-C2.
Associated injuries, including head injuries (29%), and fractures/dislocations (27%) occurred in 55% of children.
Overall mortality was 3%.
Surgical intervention was required in 14%.


FINDINGS
The six elements were found to be adequately addressed in the three countries' laws and regulations.
In all three, tuberculosis case-reporting is required, as is tuberculosis surveillance among health workers.
Each country's legal and regulatory framework also addresses the need to respect individuals' rights and privacy while safeguarding public health.
These laws and regulations create a strong foundation for tuberculosis infection control.

CONCLUSION
However, the lack of data on their implementation is a limitation.
Future research should assess the implementation and public health impact of laws and regulations.


CONCLUSIONS
Further studies, with controlled designs, are required to demonstrate intervention efficacy.


OBJECTIVE
According to Erik Erikson, the main task of adolescents is to solve the crisis of identity versus role confusion.
Research has shown that a stable and strong sense of identity is associated with better mental health of adolescents.
Good relationships with peers are also linked with better emotional and psychological well-being of adolescents.
However, there is a lack of reviews of studies in the scientific literature examining the relationship between the adolescents' identity development and relationships with peers.
The aims of this article were to analyze links between adolescent identity development and relationships with peers identified from a literature review, summarize the results, and discuss the theoretical factors that may predict these relationships.

CONCLUSIONS
Further empirical researches is needed in this area.


RESULTS
Eighty-three percent of participants scored over the clinical cut-off on at least one mental health scale and 33% reported at least one suicide attempt.
Sixty-six percent met criteria for a current SUD; 96% met lifetime criteria.
Exposure to adverse events was nearly universal (94%).
Almost half of female (46%) and almost a third of male (31%) participants endorsed symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Youth reported impairment and need for support in multiple domains of functioning, including school, peer, family and mental health.
Substance use was least likely to be identified as a treatment priority.


RESULTS
The response rate for the perceived needs assessment survey was 16 %.

LIMITATIONS
The level of evidence underlying the various guidelines was variable, and in some cases, poor.
A validated approach to data analysis in this area is lacking.


CONCLUSIONS
The antinociceptive effects of SMT may be summative and governed by a dose-response relationship in myofascial tissues.


INTRODUCTION
Most studies show motion palpation unreliable.

RESULTS
Statistical measures of data dispersion were low.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A Magnetic Resonance Arthrogram revealed a HAGL lesion.


RESULTS
Sex and grade distributions were similar in pre- and post-questionnaires.
Pre- and postknowledge scores did not differ (P=0.36).


RESULTS
Of 699 residents completing their core training in paediatrics, training path data were available for 685 (98%).
Overall, 430 (63%) residents completed subspecialty training while 255 (37%) completed general paediatrics training only.
There was a significant increase in subspecialty training, from 59% in earlier graduates (2004 to 2007) to 67% in later graduates (2008 to 2010) (P=0.037).
Practice pattern data after completion of training were available for 245 general paediatricians and 205 subspecialists.
Sixty-nine percent of general paediatricians were community based while 85% of subspecialists were hospital based in tertiary or quaternary centres.
Of all residents currently in practice, only 36 (8%) were working in rural, remote or underserviced areas.

CONCLUSIONS
Almost two-thirds of recent Canadian paediatric graduates pursued subspecialty training.
Few graduates are practicing in rural or underserviced areas.
Further studies are needed to determine whether these trends continue and their impact on the future paediatric workforce in Canada.


RESULTS
Fifty-seven stakeholders participated.
The main barrier was gaps in stakeholders' knowledge of shared decision making and decision support.
However, youth attitudes regarding the necessity and usefulness of a decision support program were a barrier.
Two themes were both a barrier and a facilitator.
First, stakeholder groups were uncertain which clinical situations are suitable for shared decision making (eg, new diagnoses, chronic illnesses, complex decisions or urgent decisions).


RESULTS
Of the 577 eligible parents, 495 (85.8%) consented to participate.

CONCLUSIONS
Only approximately one-third were aware of return-to-play guidelines.


METHODS
Twenty-three sites within 10 hospital corporations in LHIN 4 (Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant) were recruited.
A 2-part questionnaire was developed and pretested for clarity and comprehensiveness.

RESULTS
Ten pharmacy directors and 28 committee members representing 10 P&T committees responded.
A mean of 6.4 new drug requests were reviewed annually by each P&T committee.


RESULTS
Among a total of 321 medication orders reviewed, the incidence of inappropriate use was 31.2% (34/109) for dabigatran and 26.9% (57/212) for rivaroxaban.
Of the 97 reasons for inappropriate use that were identified, the most common were prescribing for an unapproved indication (49/97 [50.5%]), concomitant prescribing of another anticoagulant (22/97 [22.7%]), and high prescribed dose (9/97 [9.3%]).
The prescribing service was found to be an independent risk factor for inappropriate prescribing (p = 0.041).
Corrections were made to 23.1% (21/91) of the incorrect regimens before hospital discharge.
In a sensitivity analysis using calculated ideal body weight to estimate renal function, the overall incidence of inappropriate prescribing increased to 31.5% (101/321).

CONCLUSIONS
The proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing of dabigatran or rivaroxaban in clinical practice was higher than expected.


OBJECTIVES
The secondary objectives were to document workflow interruptions and to assess medication errors.

METHODS
This before-and-after observational study investigated chemotherapy order entry for ambulatory oncology patients.
The tasks were timed by an independent observer using a personal digital assistant.
A convenience sample of 125 orders was targeted for each phase.


RESULTS
Of the 138 respondents who returned a completed survey (74% response rate), 36 (26%) planned to apply for a hospital pharmacy residency.
Those planning to apply for a residency were older (p = 0.037) and had more hospital work experience (36% versus 3%, p < 0.001) than those not planning to apply.
Hospital experiential rotations influenced, either positively or negatively, 23 (72%) of the 32 students who changed their decision to pursue or not pursue residency training over the course of their studies.


RESULTS
Some incidents had multiple immediate and/or contributing causes.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings of this study can be used to develop job safety analyses, which can in turn be adopted in guidelines for safe handling of hazardous drugs.
Future similar studies are suggested to ensure the generalizability of results.


INTRODUCTION
In this context, we conducted a study in Ottawa, Canada, to describe e-cigarette users' perceptions of the benefits, harms and risks of e-cigarettes.
We also collected information on why, how and where they use e-cigarettes as well as information on side effects.

RESULTS
The mean age of the 242 respondents was 38.1 years (range: 16-70 years); 66% were male.
Nearly all had smoked 100 or more cigarettes in their lifetime (97.9%).
About 40% reported experiencing some side effects within 2 hours of using e-cigarettes.


FINDINGS
Twenty-six studies published between 1994 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria.
The corresponding values from comparisons with two to three Kato-Katz tests per subject were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53-0.76; n = 14), respectively.
There appeared to be no advantage in using three antigen tests per subject instead of one.
The performance of antigen testing was better in areas of high endemicity than in settings with low endemicity.


RESULTS
The association between publication before and during paediatric residency was statistically significant (OR 2.98 [95% CI 2.04 to 4.36]; P<0.001).

CONCLUSION
Residency selection committees may find these data helpful in assessing the publication potential of their applicants.


RESULTS
A total of 127 adolescents participated in the present study.
The mean (± SD) age was 16.3±1.5 years and the majority (93.7%) were female.
Only 21% believed they would ask for a chaperone if one were not offered.


RESULTS
This was equivalent to a decrease of 14.3 injuries per 1,000,000 children.


METHODS
We compared short- and long-term outcomes between these cohorts.

RESULTS
Our patient cohorts were well matched for age, sex, injury severity scores and abbreviated injury scores.
There were no significant differences in long-term outcomes, such as chest pain or dyspnea.


RESULTS
The early revision rate for TKA dropped from 3.0% in 2005 to 1.3% in 2011 (R(2) = 0.84, p = 0.003).
The leading reasons for TKA revision were infection, instability, aseptic loosening and stiffness.
The leading reasons for THA revision were infection, instability, aseptic loosening and periprosthetic fracture.

CONCLUSION
After implementation of a regional joint replacement registry we observed a significant reduction in early revision rates.


METHODS
We obtained radiographs and CT scans of patients with acute DMCFs.
Three orthopedic staff and 3 residents measured radiographic displacement at time zero and 2 weeks later.
The CT measurements identified absolute shortening in 3 dimensions (by subtracting the length of the fractured from the intact clavicle).
We then compared shortening measured on radiographs and shortening measured in 3 dimensions on CT.
Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were calculated.

RESULTS
We reviewed the fractures of 22 patients.
Interobserver reliability for plain radiograph measurements was excellent (Cronbach α = 0.90).


RESULTS
did not vary by eGFR category.


RESULTS
A total of 130 HSPs were performed: the most frequent interventions were arthrodesis (25.4%), resection of the ulnar head (15.4%) and tenorrhaphy (14.6%).
During follow-up, 33 AOs were reported in 27 (28.1%) patients, 87% of which occurred after the first HSP.
The most frequent AO subsets were impaired wound healing (18.2%) and exposed pin (15.2%).
Longer disease duration at first HSP (OR 3.07 [95% CI 1.04 to 9.08]; P=0.04) and intensive treatment (OR 1.08 [95% CI 1.002 to 1.156]; P=0.045) were predictors of AOs.
The optimal disease duration cut-off to predict AOs was 20.1 years.


RESULTS
A total of 57 patients met the inclusion criteria; there were 44 male and 13 female patients.
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of grouped physical examination findings were determined in major areas.
In further analysis, specific examination findings with n≥9 (15%) were also reported.

CONCLUSIONS
The data demonstrated a high negative predictive value of at least 90% for orbital floor, zygomatic, mandibular and nasal bone fractures compared with CT scan.
Ultimately, these results may help reduce unnecessary radiation and costly imaging in patients with facial trauma without facial fractures.


RESULTS
The follow-up period was three to 12 months (mean nine months).
Most of the double eyelids were natural.
During the follow-up period, 92% (342 of 372) patients were satisfied with the blepharoplasty.
The most common complications were swelling within first week after the operation, which subsided spontaneously.
No other severe complications were found.


RESULTS
Lateral capsular flaps were performed for 16 patients (20 breasts) resulting in durable medial repositioning of the implant for a minimum of six months follow-up (range six to 60 months).
No major complications, infectious complications or wound healing complications were reported.


RESULTS
Of the six patients who underwent the extended OC-RFFF, four had mandibular reconstruction and two had maxillary reconstruction.
The average patient age at the time of surgery was 64.5 years.
The length of radius harvested ranged from 8 cm to 14 cm (mean 9.7 cm).
Two of six patients required a single osteotomy of their bone flap.
Donor site complications included partial skin graft loss in 50% and a radius fracture in two patients.
Recipient site complications included one patient with intraoral plate exposure.
There have been no cases of nonunion.


RESULTS
Mean blood loss was approximately 1 unit.
This treatment was sufficient for all cases.
None of the patients expereinced recurrent bleeding nor did they require a blood transfusion.

CONCLUSION
Late bleeding in septorhinoplasty is rare.


RESULTS
A total of 307 patients were included: 77 (25%) lost weight through diet and exercise; and 230 (75%) through bariatric surgery.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings reveal no difference in complication rates following abdominal body contouring procedures attributable to method of weight loss.


RESULTS
Patient demographics were equal.


RESULTS
Five retrospective cohort studies including 477 patients undergoing VHR were included in the final analysis.
There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of seroma formation (OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.27 to 1.27]; P=0.18).


RESULTS
When included in stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, only FiO2 (per 0.1 unit) and the dose of norepinephrine of >20 μg/min were independently associated with early mortality.


RESULTS
Of 5922 patients, 1247 had ≥10 ppy smoking history: 77 (6.2%) had RC; 957 (76.7%) had NRC; and 213 (17.1%) had NC.
The program completion rate for each group was similar for the RC (46.8%), NRC (55.8%) and NC groups (57.3%) (P=0.26).
There were no significant differences in other outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
This is likely underestimated and/or reflects a referral bias.
CR participation resulted in significant and similar improvements in most key CR outcomes in all groups including similar completion rate.
A CR model was effective for patients with coexisting RCs.
Strategies to improve access and diagnosis should be explored.


METHODS
The available molecular and serological tests and biosafety issues are described and discussed in the context of the current outbreak strain.


PROBLEM
Toxicity from propanil is largely due to methemoglobinemia.

APPROACH
Blood with a methemoglobin concentration greater than 15% of total haemoglobin levels appears brownish in colour.
We introduced a colour reference chart that can be used to semiquantitatively determine methemoglobinemia.
Each ward in three rural hospitals received a chart.


LESSONS LEARNT
The strategy improved access to HIV testing.


RESULTS
Potential masking bias is also highlighted in our analysis of injuries attended by other health care providers.

CONCLUSION
Longer survey recall periods naturally lead to greater masking.
The design of future surveys should take these issues into account.


RESULTS
Overall, 4% of male and 9% of female students reported indoor tanning, and prevalence increased with age.
Relationships between indoor tanning and other variables were similar for male and female students.


RESULTS
In total, 133 patients were included (70 men [53%]; mean age ± standard deviation 64 ± 19 years; serum creatinine 90.4 ± 64.0 µmol/L; albumin 26.4 ± 7.0 g/L).
In each subpopulation, the Winter-Tozer equation overpredicted true concentration with greater bias and imprecision.
All equations performed poorly in the critical care subpopulation.
Only albumin (R (2) = 0.09) and total phenytoin concentration (R (2) = 0.53) were correlated with free phenytoin concentration.
The equation derived by multiple linear regression exhibited significantly less bias and imprecision than the Winter-Tozer equation in the validation set (p < 0.05).
A new, user-friendly equation, specific to the authors' patient population, was derived, which had an albumin coefficient of 0.275.


RESULTS
The median age was 75 years, and 52 (74%) were men.
At discharge, 30 (43%) were receiving TAT and 27 (39%) were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and ASA).
No patients received the combination of warfarin and clopidogrel.
Among those who received TAT, 90% (19 of 21) who received a bare metal stent had a recommended duration of 1 month, and 75% (6 of 8) who received a drug-eluting stent had a recommended duration of 1 year.
Overall, the combination of ASA, oral anticoagulant, and P2Y12 inhibitor was used for 54% (38/70) of the patients.

CONCLUSIONS
Despite current guideline recommendations, the rate of TAT utilization was lower than rates reported in the literature.


OBJECTIVE
This study was the first step in the development of such pictograms.

RESULTS
For most of the retained issues, between 3 and 6 pictograms were designed, based on the results of the semiotic analysis.


INTRODUCTION
Diaphragmatic injuries include wounds and diaphragm ruptures, due to a thoracoabdominal blunt or penetrating traumas.
Their incidence ranges between 0.8 and 15 %.
The mortality is mainly related to associated injuries.

RESULTS
Over the study period, 1535 patients had a thoraco-abdominal trauma.
There were 859 cases of blunt trauma, and 676 penetrating chest or abdominal trauma.
Our study involved 20 cases of diaphragmatic injuries (1.3 %).
The sex-ratio was 4.
The mean age was 33 years.
Stab attacks represented 60 % (12 cases).
The incidence of diaphragmatic injury was 2.6 %.
The wound was in the thorax in 60 % (seven cases).
Chest radiography was contributory in 45 % (nine cases).
The diagnosis of wounds or ruptures of the diaphragm was done preoperatively in 45 % (nine cases).
The diaphragmatic wound was on the left side in 90 % (18 cases) and its mean size was 4.3 cm.
The surgical procedure involved a reduction of herniated viscera and a suture of the diaphragm by "X" non absorbable points in 85 % (17 cases).
A thoracic aspiration was performed in all patients.
Morbidity rate was 10 % and mortality rate 5 %.


RESULTS
A total of 72 patients with penetrating abdominal trauma were classified as potential candidates for CM.
The OM and CM groups were similar in terms of age, sex, injury severity, mechanism and number of injuries.
There were no deaths in either group.
The LOS in the intensive care (ICU)/trauma unit was 4.8 ± 3.2 days in the OM group and 2.9 ± 2.6 days in the CM group (p = 0.039).


RESULTS
Of the 3243 patients in the entire cohort, we included 2884 patients with nonmissing data, of whom 535 (18.6%) received RBCT.
Overall 30-day major morbidity and mortality were 20% and 3.5%, respectively.

CONCLUSION
Blood management strategies are needed to reduce the use of RBCT after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent nonemergent, first-time cardiac surgery 18 months before and 18 months after the implementation of routine ICS.
Perioperative transfusion rates, postoperative bleeding, clinical and hematological outcomes, and overall cost were examined.
We used multivariable logistic regression modelling to determine the risk-adjusted effect of ICS on likelihood of perioperative transfusion.


RESULTS
Our study included 609 patients (405 pre- and 204 post-trauma room opening).
There was no difference in 30-day mortality (p = 0.24).


RESULTS
We assessed 751 cases of HPS.
Postoperative complications were 2.5-fold higher in peripheral centres.


METHODS
We assessed workflow using interviews and surveys to identify opportunities to optimize the referral process for the GTCS.

RESULTS
The rate of adherence to recommendations made by the GTCS team was 88.2%.


RESULTS
Overall, 425 of 1771 members completed the survey, with 375 being trauma practitioners.
Nearly all physicians (98%, 357 of 366) had previous training with IO devices, and 85% (223 of 261) had previously used an IO device in adult trauma patients.
Most respondents (79%, 285 of 361) were very comfortable placing an IO catheter in the proximal tibia.


RESULTS
However, misclassification had a substantial effect on the proportion of women in underweight and obese BMI categories.
Corrections improved estimates of obesity prevalence, but over- and underestimated other BMI categories.
Corrections had nonsignificant effects on the associations between BMI and SGA, LGA, and caesarean section.

CONCLUSION
However, the general trend in associations is unaffected.


RESULTS
Rates vary based on sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status and place of residence.


METHODS
Informed consent documents (IC) were coded by two independent coders.

RESULTS
We found variance between IC produced by commercial laboratories versus those provided by local clinics or health care systems, and considerable variance among materials from all sources.
"Commercial" IC were longer and written at a more difficult reading level than "non-commercial" IC, and were less likely to state explicitly that cfDNA only screens for certain conditions.
About one-third of IC were combined with laboratory order forms.
Though most IC recommended confirmatory testing for positive results, only about half clearly stated that results could be incorrect-including mentions of false positives or false negatives.
About one-third of IC explicitly stated that cfDNA screening was optional.
While nearly all IC from any source listed the conditions screened by the test, only about half of the IC included any phenotypic descriptions of these conditions.
Few IC mentioned psychosocial considerations, and only one IC mentioned the availability of support groups for families of children with genetic conditions.


FINDINGS
WHO's guidelines provide 33 recommendations on the topic.
However, 16 (48.5%) of these recommendations were based solely on expert opinion - unsupported by published evidence.
Trials registries included 20 studies related to the topic, including nine trials of alternative feeding regimens.
Acute medical management and follow-up care studies were minimally represented.


METHODS
Implementation began in February 2015 in two out of eight provinces of Apurimac, including hard-to-reach communities.
We made an observational study of the processes and outcomes of adapting and scaling-up the intervention.
Qualitative and quantitative analyses were made of data collected from March 2015 to January 2016 from programme documents, routine reports and structured evaluation questionnaires completed by teachers.

FINDINGS
Partnerships were expanded after sharing the results of the pilot phase.
Teachers' appraisal of the training achieved high positive scores.
Outreach eye clinics and subsidies for glasses were provided for poorer families.


METHODS
Mathematical models based on municipal-level census, crime and gang-intelligence data were used to estimate the effect of the truce on homicide rates.
One model estimated the overall effect after accounting for the linear trend and seasonality in the homicide rate.
In a moderated-effect model, we investigated the relationship between the truce effect and the numbers of MS13 (Mara Salvatrucha 13) and Eighteenth-Street gang members imprisoned per 100 000 population.
We then ran each of these two models with additional control variables.

FINDINGS
For any given municipality, the effectiveness of the truce appeared to increase as the number of MS13 gang members imprisoned per 100 000 population increased.
We did not observe the same significant relationship for imprisoned Eighteenth-Street gang members.


FINDINGS
In total, 4115 cholera patients were treated at the 41 facilities: 1946 (47.3%) had severe disease and 62 (1.5%) deaths occurred.

CONCLUSION
Moreover, severe disease was the strongest predictor of death.
Two doses of oral cholera vaccine should be used in emergencies to reduce the disease burden.


METHODS
In total 22.5 hours of semi-structured interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a framework method.


FINDINGS
We identified one cluster-randomized control trial and 22 quasi-experimental studies.
All of the included interventions targeted poor women living in low- or middle-income countries.
Some included a health-promotion component.
The results of the higher quality studies indicated an association between membership of a microfinance scheme and improvements in the health of women and their children.
The observed improvements included reduced maternal and infant mortality, better sexual health and, in some cases, lower levels of interpersonal violence.


RESULTS
A total of 7 randomized controlled trials were appraised.
Five of the studies measured an IASTM intervention versus a control or alternate intervention group for a musculoskeletal pathology.
The results of the studies were insignificant (p>.05) with both groups displaying equal outcomes.
Two studies measured an IASTM intervention versus a control or alternate intervention group on the effects of joint ROM.
The IASTM intervention produced significant (P<.05) short term gains up to 24 hours.

CONCLUSION
The literature measuring the effects of IASTM is still emerging.
There appears to be some evidence supporting its ability to increase short term joint ROM.


RESULTS
Fifty paediatric neck pain patient files were analysed.


CLINICAL FEATURES
A 17-year old baseball player presented with chronic lateral elbow pain.
Examination revealed swelling of the elbow with signs of possible ligament, muscle, and tendon injury.
Examination revealed a swollen and tender elbow, with plain x-ray confirming a subchondral bone disorder (osteochondral defect) of the capitellum.
Rehabilitation of the elbow began immediately following surgery.


INTRODUCTION
In 2006, the World Health Organization launched the Global Age-Friendly Cities Project to support active aging.

RESULTS
A user-friendly guide is available to support and share this work.


INTRODUCTION
However, these data may not be accessible to all researchers.
Another source for population size estimates is the Statistics Canada census.

RESULTS
After the CCDSS denominator was adjusted for the growth components, the difference between the two estimates was reduced to 431 323 people, a difference of 1.3%.


METHODS
We then investigated temporal trends in the level and inequality of such coverage in eight of the countries.

FINDINGS
In each of the World Health Organization's regions, it appeared that about 56-69% of eligible children in the low- and middle-income countries had received full immunization.
However, within each region, the mean recorded level of such coverage varied greatly.
In the African Region, for example, it varied from 11.4% in Chad to 90.3% in Rwanda.


FINDINGS
Of the samples from the longitudinal cohort, none of the 153 collected between 2011 and 2013 but 78.7% (48/61) of those collected in 2014 were positive for IgG responses to the chikungunya virus antigen.


FINDINGS
Of the 54 522 persons with hepatitis B disease notified between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2012, 1953  infections were newly acquired.
Acute hepatitis B infection notification rates were significantly higher for indigenous than non-indigenous Australians.
The rates per 100 000 population for all ages were 3.6 (156/4 368 511) and 1.1 (1797/168 449 302) for indigenous and non-indigenous people respectively.
The rate ratio of age-standardized notifications was 4.0 (95% confidence interval: 3.7-4.3).


METHODS
In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika.
By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding.
We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations.

FINDINGS
We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection.
The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection.
On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection.
The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average.
Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28-0.88).


BACKGROUND
Secreting interstitial cell (Leydig cell) tumors are rare.


METHODS
Potential add-on interventions were identified through a literature review and expert consultations.

FINDINGS
The most effective interventions in the whole package were insecticide-treated bednets, measles vaccine and preventive zinc supplementation.


FINDINGS
Of the 25 anti-cancer medicines on the 2013 Model List and the 16 added via the 2015 revision of the Model List, 0-25 (median: 17) and 0-15 (median: 3) appeared in national lists, respectively.
There was considerable variability in these numbers within and between World Bank income groups.
The numbers of these new medicines included in national lists were significantly correlated (P ≤ 0.0001) with per-capita GNI (r = 0.45), per-capita annual government health expenditure (r = 0.33) and number of physicians per 1000 population (r = 0.48).


METHODS
We recruited four laboratory technicians to be mentors and trained them in mentoring skills, laboratory quality management practices and international standard organization (ISO) 15189 requirements for medical laboratories.
The tool - translated into Khmer - included a set of quality improvement activities grouped into four phases for implementation with increasing complexity.
We present the achievements in implementation from September 2014 to March 2016.


METHODS
We analysed epidemiological data on a total of 149 570 live births collected between 2007 and 2013 in six prospective randomized trials and a cohort study from predominantly rural areas of Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Pakistan, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia.
The neonatal mortality rate and mortality within 24 hours of birth were estimated for all countries and mortality within 6 hours was estimated for four countries with available data.
The findings were compared with published model-based estimates of neonatal mortality.

CONCLUSION
Neonatal mortality within 24 hours of birth in predominantly rural areas of six low- and lower-middle-income countries was higher than model-based estimates for these countries.
Implementation of high-quality, effective obstetric and early newborn care should be a priority in these settings.


APPROACH
A public health approach was used with standardized training and treatment and regular supervision and monitoring of the programme.

LOCAL SETTING
About 3000 patients were on ART in nine clinics.


RESULTS
A search of PubMed articles for "human papillomavirus vaccine" was used to identify all-type HPV clinical studies prior to October 2014.
Following PRISMA guidelines, the literature review rendered 13 publications that met inclusion/ exclusion criteria.
Two studies included both males and females.
The most common AE were injection-site reactions.
On the other hand, systemic symptoms did not statistically significantly differ between the vaccination cohort (35.28 %, n = 3351) and the control cohort (36.14 %, n = 3198) (p = 0.223).
The pregnancy/ perinatal outcomes rendered no statistically significant difference between the vaccine group and control group.


OBJECTIVES
Sleep disturbances in children with ADHD impact their functioning and overall Quality of Life.


OBJECTIVE
Pregnancy in youth is considered high risk from a number of different standpoints.

CONCLUSIONS
Pregnant and postpartum adolescents and young adults possess multiple risk factors across various domains that threaten short and long term health outcomes.


RESULTS
Nineteen female participants completed the study and had a mean age of 15.8 years (range 13.9 -17.8).
Attrition rate was low (17%).
Attendance to mindfulness sessions (84%) and compliance to study protocol (100%) were high.
All participants reported a positive change in the way they coped with pain.
No changes in quality of life, depression, anxiety, pain perception, and psychological distress were detected.

CONCLUSIONS
Mindfulness is a promising therapeutic approach for which limited data exist in adolescents with chronic pain.
Our study indicates the feasibility of conducting such interventions in teenage girls.


RESULTS
Self-harm incidents were reported in 60 of 501 (12%) admissions during the one-year period of the study.
Fourteen percent of patients (50 of 351) accounted for total number of 136 self-harm incidents.
Half of these incidents (49%) occurred outside of the hospital setting, when patients were on passes.

CONCLUSION
Further research is required to better understand these factors, and to develop strategies to better support these patients.


OBJECTIVE
We wished to explore the adolescent patient experience of being diagnosed with BPD.

RESULTS
Twenty-one participants had analyzable data.
We found wide variability in responses.


RESULTS
Conversely, the ADHD group exhibited selective deficits in cognitive domains such as working memory, planning/organization, monitoring, and metacognition.
The two PBD groups showed greater impairment than the ADHD group in the domains of Inhibition, Shifting, Monitoring and Emotional Control.
Furthermore, results from regression analyses suggest cognitive predictors of EF impairment in ADHD and mood predictors for inhibition in PBD.


RESULTS
The final 2014 SLCDC-MA sample consists of a total of 3361 respondents (68.9% response rate).
Most were young or middle-aged (85%), Canadian born (88%), of non-Aboriginal status (95%), and resided in an urban setting (82%).
Forty-five percent reported having a mood disorder only, 24% an anxiety disorder only and 31% both kinds of disorder.


RESULTS
Approximately one in three individuals with mood and/or anxiety disorders reported high SRMH.


METHODS
Mortality rates derived using the different methods were compared.

FINDINGS
On average, 3.4 causes per death were listed on each certificate.
Moreover, this method highlighted the mortality burden associated with certain diseases in specific age groups.


FINDINGS
Of the 14 092 children included in the analysis, 13 266 (94.1%) were successfully checked by oximetry.


METHODS
For in-depth analysis and comparisons, we extracted data from 49 demographic and health surveys.
We calculated percentage coverage for the two summary indices, and correlated these with each other and with outcome indicators of mortality and undernutrition.
We also stratified the summary indicators by wealth quintiles for a subset of nine countries.

FINDINGS
Data on the component indicators in the required age range were less often available for co-coverage than for the composite coverage index.
Both summary indices provided useful summaries of the degrees of inequality in the countries' coverage.


METHODS
Nine of 11 countries in the region agreed to be assessed.
During February to November 2015 a joint team from WHO and ministries of health conducted 4-5 day missions to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.
We collected information through guided discussions with senior technical leaders and visits to hospitals, laboratories and airports.

FINDINGS
Political commitment to Ebola preparedness was high in all countries.
Major vulnerabilities included inadequate risk assessment and risk communication; gaps in data management and analysis for event surveillance; and limited capacity in molecular diagnostic techniques.
Many countries had limited planning for a surge of Ebola cases.


METHODS
We excluded comorbidity-related costs.


METHODS
The applied perspective was that of the Flemish government.

FINDINGS
The mean costs of these activities were 5564 (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 3791-8160), 11 603 (95% UI: 9010-14 909) and 13 941 (95% UI: 10 723-18 201) euros (€) per detected active case, respectively.
Between 2007 and 2014, no active tuberculosis cases were detected during screening in the juvenile detention centres.


METHODS
Research priorities were identified in a three-round process involving two surveys.
Questions were collated and organized according to the four-step public health approach to violence prevention.

FINDINGS
The key limitations of the study were response and attrition rates among survey respondents.
However, these rates were in line with similar priority-setting exercises.


METHODS
Between 2009 and 2014, we followed 2134 children from eight sites in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania, enrolled in the MAL-ED birth cohort study.
We estimated the incidence of antibiotic use and the associations of antibiotic use with child and household characteristics.
We described treatment patterns for diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses, and identified factors associated with treatment and antibiotic class.

FINDINGS
Antibiotic treatment was given for 375/499 (75.2%) episodes of bloody diarrhoea and for 4274/9661 (44.2%) episodes of diarrhoea without bloody stools.
Antibiotics were used in 2384/3943 (60.5%) episodes of fieldworker-confirmed acute lower respiratory tract illness as well as in 6608/16742 (39.5%) episodes of upper respiratory illness.
Penicillins were used most frequently for respiratory illness, while antibiotic classes for diarrhoea treatment varied within and between sites.


APPROACH
We documented all Zika virus outbreaks and cases in 21 Pacific Islands and territories for the years 2007 to 2015.
We extracted data from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative database on the reported and expected annual incidence of AFP in children younger than 15 years.
Using a Poisson probability test, we tested the significance of unexpected increases in AFP in years correlating with Zika virus emergence.
Data were analysed separately for each Pacific Island country and territory.

LESSONS LEARNT
More evidence may be needed from adult populations, who are more likely to be affected by Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Reporting of AFP may be deficient in regions certified as polio-free.


RESULTS
Several knowledge gaps were identified in the sample population.

CONCLUSION
Chiropractors appear to possess the skills and knowledge to diagnose and manage concussion equal to their medical counterparts.
However, knowledge gaps regarding concussion diagnosis and management were found among chiropractic students and residents.


RESULTS
The response rate for the survey was 46% (N = 343).
By using average estimates, it was determined that 72% of the respondents meet the (2012) Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines.
Furthermore, at least 88% percent believed that chiropractors must adhere to a healthy lifestyle in order to effectively model a healthy lifestyle to their patients.


RESULTS
This search strategy yielded 27 articles from aforementioned databases.
After removal of duplicates and implementation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 8 articles for extensively reviewed.

CONCLUSION
This narrative review suggests that the King-Devick test is an efficient sideline assessment tool for sport-related concussions.
However, we recommend that the King-Devick should be used as a sideline screening tool, not a concussion diagnosis tool at this time.
A proper baseline time including multiple tests may be recommended to negate the learning affect and to have a reliable baseline in which to measure from for future reference.
A three second difference appears appropriate to identify the possibility of concussion and to remove an athlete from play.
At this time, the athlete should be monitored and further evaluated as symptoms are sometimes delayed.
We also suggest further research may investigate the K-D test a potential return-to-play tool for clinicians and medical personnel.


RESULTS
However, both groups were similar in their opinions about research collaborations.


CONCLUSION
Health is associated with how communities are planned and built, and the services and resources provided within them.


RESULTS
The leading causes of contact burns were stoves/ovens and fireplaces/accessories.


RESULTS
The fertilization rate after ICSI was affected by oligospermia.


RESULTS
Treated males have had no conceptions since Vasalgel injections.
Three unilateral vasectomies were performed, one was necessary for incorrect placement of Vasalgel, the other two were elective.

CONCLUSIONS
Complications were few and similar to those associated with traditional vasectomy.


RESULTS
During the study period, 1310 patients underwent resection of CRCLM.
Of these, 226 (17%) patients had synchronous disease; 100 (44%) had a simultaneous resection and 126 (56%) had a staged resection.
For the simultaneous and the staged groups, the mean number of liver lesions resected was 1.6 and 2.3, respectively (p < 0.001); the mean size of the largest lesion was 3.1 and 4.8 cm, respectively (p < 0.001); and the major hepatic resection rate was 21% and 79%, respectively (p < 0.001).
Postoperative mortality for simultaneous cases at 90 days was less than 5%.
Five-year overall survival and cancer-specific survival for patients with simultaneous resection was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26%-45%) and 37% (95% CI 25%-50%), respectively.
Simultaneous resections are common in the general population.
A more conservative approach is being adopted for simultaneous resections by limiting the extent of liver resection.
Postoperative mortality and long-term survival in this patient population is similar to that reported in other contemporary series.

CONCLUSION
One-third of these patients achieved long-term survival.


CONCLUSION
The PA delivers quality care and improves system efficiencies.


RESULTS
Antibiotics based on culture results were prescribed in 24% of cases.
Organisms cultured at the time of reoperation differed from those isolated initially.
The cost of performing 996 allograft cultures was $169 320.

CONCLUSION
This series suggests that rates of positive intraoperative bone allograft culture are low, and subsequent infection is rare.
In cases of postoperative infection, primary allograft culture and secondary tissue cultures isolated different organisms.
Costs associated with performing cultures are high.
Eliminating initial culture testing could save $42 500 per year in our health region.


METHODS
Linear regression tested for trends across fiscal years for women and men.

RESULTS
We obtained 46 341 patient records.
Second hip fracture accounted for 8.3% of hip fracture surgeries.
These sex-specific trends were similar for both pertrochanteric and transcervical fracture types.


METHODS
We reviewed RCTs assessing an operative intervention published in 2008 and 2009 and indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE or the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
After a pilot of the selection criteria, 1 reviewer selected trials and another reviewer checked the selection.
We calculated odds ratios (OR) and pooled in random-effects meta-analysis to obtain an overall estimate of the association between patient importance and primary outcome specification.

RESULTS
In 350 included RCTs, a total of 8258 outcomes were reported (median 18 per trial.
The mean proportion (per trial) of patient-important outcomes was 60%, and 66% of trials specified a patient-important primary outcome.
The most commonly reported patient-important primary outcomes were morbid events (41%), intervention outcomes (11%), function (11%) and pain (9%).
Surrogate and laboratory-based primary outcomes were reported in 33% and 8% of trials, respectively.
Patient-important outcomes were not associated with primary outcome status (OR 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.63-1.1, I2 = 21%).


RESULTS
We identified 84 publications from 188 research abstracts (45%) and 17 publications from 39 research grants (44%).
The mean time to publication was 1.8 years and the mean impact factor was 2.7.
Finally, CSVS research grant recipients who subsequently published had a significantly higher h-index at the time of receipt than those who had not published.


RESULTS
Superficial SSI was most often associated with environmental factors, such as environmental contamination by fungi (from 2 colony-forming units) and bacteria as well as surface contamination.
When there was no contamination in the operating room, no SSI was detected.
Antibiotic prophylaxis and shaving with electric razor were protective factors for both types of infection, whereas the duration of the intervention and the classification of the intervention as "dirty" were shared risk factors.


RESULTS
Data from 346 patients (mean age 66.8 [range 24-91] yr) who underwent primary or revision TKA depicted an overall symptomatic VTE rate of 15%.
The proximal DVT rate was 1.7%, and the nonfatal PE rate was 0.9%.
The mean time to VTE diagnosis was 5.6 days.
The first dalteparin dose was administered 19.5 (range 10-48) h after surgery in patients without VTE and 22.6 (range 11.5-52) h after surgery in patients with VTE (p = 0.003).
With a first dose of dalteparin administered 12 h postoperatively, patients presented significantly lower DVT and PE rates than if it was administered 24 h postoperatively (8.5% v. 16.3%, p = 0.048).


RESULTS
There were 16 traditional patients and 13 RAPMIR patients.


METHODS
Logistic regression was used to examine the influence of trauma centre designation level on risk-adjusted surgical delays, mortality and complications.


RESULTS
Of the 90 patients screened, 39 were randomized and 26 had complete follow-up.
The mean cost of radiographs over the first 6 weeks was $44.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 38.64-50.38) per patient in the experimental group, and $129.23 (95% CI 120.23-138.23) in the control group (p < 0.001).
The mean time spent in clinic at 2 weeks was 46 min (95% CI 32-60) per patient for the experimental group and 68 min (95% CI 55-81) for the control group (p = 0.018).
Two complications occurred in the experimental group.
Both were detected clinically and did not qualify as missed events.


CONCLUSION
We have gone further by documenting where those savings were in a matched cohort design.
Furthermore, we determined where cost savings could be realized during the patient encounter and to what degree.
Furthermore, it was deemed to be safe in the perioperative period.


CONCLUSION
These findings suggest that long-term sustainable solutions are required to improve access to emergency care.


CONCLUSION
Long-term retention of IMG physicians remains a concern.


METHODS
The primary study outcome was in-hospital or first 30-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were blood product transfusion, length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and postoperative complications.

RESULTS
We included 132 patients in our study: 40 (mean age 68 ± 14 yr, 70% men) underwent MINI and 92 (62 ± 13 yr, 40% men) underwent STERN.
The MINI group had significantly more comorbidities than the STERN group.
Individual complication rates were similar between the MINI and STERN groups, except for intra-aortic balloon pump requirement (IABP; 0% v. 12%, p = 0.034).
MINI significantly reduced the need for any blood transfusion (68% v. 84%, p = 0.036) or packed red blood cells (63% v. 79%, p = 0.042), fresh frozen plasma (35% v. 59%, p = 0.012) and platelets (20% v. 40%, p = 0.024).


CONCLUSION
Using patient-reported information, we can correctly predict the outcome of specialist consultation for TKR in 70% of cases.


RESULTS
There were 114 subjects (36 fertile and 78 infertile) selected into this study.
We found no significant difference in the age between both of groups.
The median value of sperm DFI in infertile group was significantly higher, 29.95 (26.6-34.3)%, compared to 19.90 (15.6-24.4)% of the fertile group, with p < 0.001.
Area Under Curve (AUC) of sperm DFI, 0.862 (95% CI 0.783, 0.941), was higher than concentration (AUC 0.744; 95% CI 0.657, 0.831), motility (AUC 0.668; 95% CI 0.572, 0.765), and morphology (AUC 0.718; 95% CI 0.697, 0.864) of the semen analysis.
Sperm DFI of ≥26.1% had prevalence ratio of 2.84 (95% CI 1.86, 4.33) for the occurrence of male infertility.


METHODS
The Mais Médicos (More Doctors) programme was launched in July 2013 with public calls to recruit physicians for priority areas.
Other strategies were to increase primary care infrastructure investments and to provide more places at medical schools.
We conducted a quasi-experimental, before-and-after evaluation of the implementation of the programme in 1708 municipalities with populations living in extreme poverty and in remote border areas.
We compared physician density, primary care coverage and avoidable hospitalizations in municipalities enrolled (n = 1450) and not enrolled (n = 258) in the programme.
Data extracted from health information systems and Ministry of Health publications were analysed.

FINDINGS
The number of municipalities with ≥ 1.0 physician per 1000 inhabitants doubled from 163 in 2013 to 348 in 2015.
Primary care coverage in enrolled municipalities (based on 3000 inhabitants per primary care team) increased from 77.9% in 2012 to 86.3% in 2015.
We also documented higher infrastructure investments in enrolled municipalities and an increase in the number of medical school places over the study period.


FINDINGS
Between 2012 and 2015, 54 CHWs, seven peer supervisors and three clinical supervisors were trained to serve a population of 12 127 people in 44 communities.
The regression-adjusted percentage of children receiving care from formal care providers increased by 60.1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 51.6 to 68.7) percentage points for diarrhoea, by 30.6 (95% CI: 20.5 to 40.7) for fever and by 51.2 (95% CI: 37.9 to 64.5) for acute respiratory infection.
Facility-based delivery increased by 28.2 points (95% CI: 20.3 to 36.1).


RELEVANT CHANGES
The participants' quality of life had also improved.
The average EQ-5D-5L score, measuring quality of life, increased by 0.203 - from 0.346 at baseline to 0.549 after the modifications.


APPROACH
In 2001, the Thai Ministry of Public Health introduced a policy on migrant health.
Migrant health insurance is a voluntary scheme, funded by an annual premium paid by workers.
It enables access to health care at public facilities and reduces catastrophic health expenditures for undocumented migrants and their dependants.


CONCLUSION
Such facilities were especially scarce in rural areas.
Similar systematic analyses of the quality of primary care could inform national efforts to strengthen health systems.


METHODS
We used data for 211 643 children from demographic and health surveys in 47 low- and middle-income countries (median study year 2012).
Data were from vaccination cards and maternal interviews.
We grouped countries according to the vaccination schedule and type of vaccine used (monovalent or combination).
For each country, we calculated hepatitis B vaccination coverage and timely receipt of vaccine doses.
We used multivariable logistic regression models to study the effect of vaccination schedules and types on vaccination delay.

FINDINGS
Substantial delays in vaccination were observed even in countries with fairly high coverage of all doses.
Median delay was 1.0 week (interquartile range, IQR: 0.3 to 3.6) for the first dose (n = 108 626 children) and 3.7 weeks (IQR: 1.4 to 9.3) for the third dose (n = 101  542).


METHODS
We reviewed field data from pre-exposure prophylaxis campaigns in Peru and the Philippines.

FINDINGS
Pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis was safe and immunogenic in children and adults, also when co-administered with routine childhood vaccinations and the Japanese encephalitis vaccine.
Although pre-exposure prophylaxis has been advocated for high-risk populations, only Peru and the Philippines have implemented appropriate national programmes.
In the future, accelerated regimens and novel vaccines could simplify delivery and increase affordability.


RESULTS
The vast majority of participants (95%) completed the study.


RESULTS
Three studies evaluated the efficacy of naltrexone, a µ-opioid antagonist, and 2 studies evaluated the efficacy of nalfurafine, a κ-opioid agonist.
Duration of included studies was short, ranging from 2 to 9 weeks.


CONCLUSIONS
Abiotrophia defectiva is an unusual cause of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
The organism is a normal commensal of the oral cavity and may cause peritonitis in patients with nonadherence to dialysis technique.
In our case, the infection was followed by peritoneal membrane failure and transfer to hemodialysis.


RESULTS
A total of 173 patients were invited to participate, of whom 137 (79%) completed surveys.
Fifty HCPs completed 623 corresponding surveys: 132 by physicians, 112 by nurses, 126 by pharmacists, 127 by social workers, and 126 by dietitians.


RESULTS
The median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 6.7 (3.3-10.3) years.
Graft loss occurred in 27.6% of the cohort.
The risk score had a concordance probability of 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.82).


RESULTS
Approximately 22% of Métis and First Nations children and youth were overweight, and 15% were classified as obese.
Over 80% of the sample was reported as food secure, 9% experienced low food security and 7% were severely food insecure.
Negative school environment was also a significant predictor of obesity risk, independent of demographic, household and geographic factors.

CONCLUSION
This study reinforces the importance of including social determinants of health, such as income, school environment and geography, in programs or policies targeting child obesity.


INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a complex risk factor for chronic disease that is associated with a number of socioecological determinants.


RESULTS
Six (of the 26) interventions qualified as promising practices.


RESULTS
The predicted 10-year risk of developing diabetes for the Canadian population in 2011/12 was 9.98%, corresponding to 2.16 million new cases.
Total health care costs attributable to diabetes during this period were $7.55 billion for females and $7.81 billion for males ($15.36 billion total).
Acute hospitalizations accounted for the greatest proportion of costs (43.2%).


RESULTS
In 2012, an estimated 700 000 (2.5%) Canadians aged 15 years and older reported symptoms compatible with GAD in the previous 12 months.
MDE symptoms co-occurred in 50% of these individuals.

CONCLUSION
Improved diagnosis, screening for comorbidity and management are essential to minimize the impacts of this mental illness.


RESULTS
Furthermore, serum IL-6 was negatively associated with AMH levels (r = -0.324, p = 0.023), with a negative trend between LBP and AMH also approaching significance (r = -0.267, p = 0.064).


CONCLUSIONS
Further improvements in Cr assay performance are needed.


METHODS
Questions were graded on a Likert Scale and tailed for mean scores.

CONCLUSION
Desirable residency programs should develop early access to surgical and operative skills.


METHODS
We performed a systematic review of EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.
We excluded studies assessing nonsurgical/trauma services or pediatrics and review articles.

RESULTS
Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria.
With the addition of NPs and PAs, patient length of stay decreased, and morbidity and mortality were unchanged.
In addition, resident workload decreased, sleep time increased, and operating time improved.
Patient and health care worker satisfaction rates were high.
Several studies reported cost savings after the addition of NPs/PAs.


RESULTS
We examined clinicopathological information on the outcomes of 530 patients with gastrointestinal NETs.
The overall incidence of NETs increased from 11 per million to 19 per million during the study period.
Advancing stage and patient age were associated with poor overall or disease-specific outcomes.
Surgery, both curative and palliative, was associated with decreased risk of overall (hazard ratio [HR] 0.5, p < 0.001) and disease-specific (HR 0.5, p < 0.001) death.
The biggest benefit was observed in patients with distant disease, in whom 5-year disease-specific survival for R0 resections was nearly double that for patients with macroscopic residual disease (92% v. 48%, p = 0.009).
Older age was associated with poor 5-year overall and disease-specific survival (p < 0.001).

CONCLUSION
Surgery, both curative and palliative, was associated with decreased risk of overall and disease-specific death.
Compared with patients with residual macroscopic disease, patients with distant disease were nearly twice as likely to survive 5 years if they had R0 resections.
The use of radioisotope therapy and long-acting octreotide therapy was also associated with improved outcomes overall.


RESULTS
Polyglactin 910 sutures, in all knot configurations, were more prone to slippage than silk sutures (p < 0.001).


METHODS
Three hundred and fifty-five, 6-12 year old children clinically diagnosed with ADHD were included in the study.
Comorbid anxiety disorders, Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and Conduct Disorder (CD) were examined.
The EF domains were assessed using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Tower of London (ToL), Finger Windows (FW) and Self Ordered Pointing Test (SOPT).

RESULTS
However, once sex was controlled for the results for FW were no longer significant.
Children with CD obtained lower scores on WCST.
Furthermore, a significant sex by CD interaction was observed.


CONCLUSION
The findings from this study suggest that most participants were aware of their tics but unaware of the cause of tics/TS.
The interviews also highlighted that, for most participants, TS caused emotional, social, physical, and/or occupational impairment.


RESULTS
Thirteen patients had exposure to clozapine and fourteen had no exposure to clozapine.
Cannabis use decreased in patients treated with clozapine, compared to patients treated with other antipsychotics (OR 2.8; 95% CI 0.97-7.9).
Compared to no medication, clozapine exposure was associated with significantly less cannabis use (OR 7.1; 95% CI 2.3-22.3).

CONCLUSIONS
Clinical trials are warranted.


RESULTS
A total of 28 patients were identified: 16 with dysplastic BE (14 HGD, 1 low-grade dysplasia, 1 intermediate dysplasia) and 12 with IMC.
Complete eradication of HGD was achieved in 11 of 14 (79%) patients.
Complications occurred in 2 of 28 (7%) patients; both had esophageal strictures managed with dilatation.
Median duration of follow-up was 371 days.


METHODS
We assessed the reports to determine whether individual or multiple criteria were associated with malignancy.

RESULTS
Overall it was clear that microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins and solid nodules were significantly more likely to be found in malignant neoplasms; their absence predicted benign disease.
Because so few reports consistently documented all criteria, the overall ability of thyroid ultrasonography to discriminate between lowerand higher-risk nodules is limited.


INTRODUCTION
SATS was introduced in the emergency center (EC) of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in January 2010.
This study seeks to evaluate the accurate use of the SATS by nurses at KATH.


METHODS
Chemical stability was calculated from the intersection of the lower 95% confidence limit of the degradation rate and the lower limit of acceptability (90%) for concentration remaining.


CONCLUSIONS
Limited use of palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis led to reasonable rates of RSV-positive hospital visits in the study population.


METHODS
This pilot project had a pretest-posttest study design.
The intervention was an educational program comprising 8 self-directed learning modules, each with a corresponding seminar.
Descriptive statistics, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the Student t-test, and the paired Student t-test were used where appropriate.
Associations were assessed with the Pearson or Spearman rho correlation coefficient.
All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and the p value for significance was established a priori at 0.05.

RESULTS
Among the 21 pharmacists who completed the program, the average test score (± standard deviation) was 27.2 ± 8.1 before the program, increasing to 39.2 ± 8.7 after the program (p < 0.001).
There was a statistically significant improvement in the perceived level of knowledge for each individual module (p < 0.05 for all).


DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS
The search yielded 10 studies (3 nonrandomized studies, 5 RCTs, and 2 meta-analyses).
The nonrandomized studies and the RCTs had inconsistent results with respect to cardiovascular death and adverse cardiovascular events.
However, these data are potentially confounded by small sample sizes, low event rates, and variable outcome reporting.
There was also high clinical heterogeneity among the studies, which may not reflect contemporary practice.


INTRODUCTION
Chronic disease management requires substantial services integration.

RESULTS
A total of 1689 patients took part in the study (60.1% participation rate).
Approximately 40% of patients withdrew from the program during the first year.
At the 12-month follow-up (n = 992), we observed a significant increase in the proportion of patients achieving the various clinical targets.


RESULTS
We observed significant correlations in the anticipated direction between emotional, psychological and social well-being scores and related concepts.

CONCLUSION
Our study suggests that the MHC-SF measures a three-factor model of positive mental health in the Canadian population.
Social well-being is important in a comprehensive measure of positive mental health, and further research is recommended.


OBJECTIVE
To detail the presentation of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) in the ankle joint.

CLINICAL FEATURES
A rheumatology follow-up was recommended and at-home treatment was prescribed to treat acute symptoms and monitor progress.


INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME
The patient reported spontaneous resolution of pain approximately 14 months post onset.


RESULTS
In Phase 1, 21 OLs were selected from 80 nominees.
Sixteen attended a training workshop.


RESULTS
Spermatozoa were present in all subject ejaculates after the reversal procedure.
Sperm concentration and sperm motility were similar to baseline levels after reversal, while sperm forward progression was significantly lower and normal acrosomes were not observed.
Forward progression percentages increased linearly during six months of semen collection, however, normal acrosomes were not observed at the conclusion of the study.
Histologically, several vasa deferentia were clear of the device and contained an intact epithelial lining.
A smaller proportion of tissues contained residual test material.
A secondary intraluminal inflammatory response was seen occasionally in the tissues containing residual material.
There was no difference between the two device variations for studied parameters.

CONCLUSIONS
Vasalgel's prevention of sperm transport for 14 months was reversed through an intravasal injection of sodium bicarbonate.


RESULTS
In 1949, Dr Albert Ross Tilley arrived at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.
In 1963, Kenneth Wyllie founded the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in Kingston, Ontario, having completed plastic surgery training in Toronto and Edinburgh with experiences in Stockholm (Sweden), Paris (France) and Baltimore (Maryland, USA).
He was shortly joined by Pat Shoemaker (Meds '66).
John Davidson (Meds '82) arrived in 1989, bringing an interest in microsurgery and critical inquiry to the division.
Five notable surgeons, Cartotto (Meds '88), Watkins, Watters, Meathrel (Meds '03) and McKay, further enhanced the Division's clinical and academic mission.


RESULTS
Infection was the most common complication (five cases).


RESULTS
Very good results were obtained in all patients with mild unilateral CBP.
Complications included lagophthalmos (15.4%) and undercorrection (3.8%).
Visual system disorders, mainly amblyopia, resulting from strabismus, astigmatism, anisometropia and CBP, were observed in 88.5% of patients.

CONCLUSIONS
Postoperative results in patients with CBP supported the efficacy of the methods that shortened the levator palpebrae superioris.
Supplementing with Mustarde's modified method contributed to an increase in the number of favourable postoperative results.


RESULTS
A list of 53 eligible programs was compiled.
Only 15 of 51 (29%) ASRM program links were functional.
On average, the combined content from ASRM website and individual MFWs had 2.91 of 6 recruitment variables and 1.32 of 6 education variables, respectively.
The majority of programs listed 'eligibility criteria' (87%) and 'general information' (87%).
'Evaluation criteria' were most poorly reported (4%).
Recruitment score was higher for United States programs compared with international counterparts (51% versus 33%, respectively; P=0.02).
It was also higher in programs that focus on 'extremity' versus 'breast' (58% versus 37%; P=0.0028).
Education scores did not differ according to location, program size, subspecialty of focus or participation in the Microsurgery Match process.


RESULTS
All patients completed the study and both groups had similar demographic data.
No differences in operative data were observed.
The mean operative time was 35 min and the mean blood loss was found to be minimal.
In group B, no implant or wound infection was noticed.
No capsular contractures or hematomas were observed.

CONCLUSIONS
Further randomized clinical trials, in combination with guidelines from aesthetic plastic surgery societies, appear to be warranted.


RESULTS
The mean follow-up period for all patients was 12.3 months.
There were no infections, hematomas or postoperative bleeding.


METHODS
Data on observed indicators of latrine use were aggregated into a measure of community sanitation usage calculated as the proportion of households with a latrine in use.
All household members were examined for clinical signs, i.e. trachomatous inflammation, follicular and/or intense, indicative of active trachoma.


METHODS
We calculated the proportion, in mean percentage, of children who had received bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, three doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine and measles vaccine.
To measure inequities between wealth quintiles, we calculated the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII) for all surveys.

FINDINGS
From 2001 to 2014, the proportion of children who received all vaccines at the age of 12 months increased from 68.8% (95% confidence interval, CI: 67.5-70.1) to 82.4% (95% CI: 80.7-84.0).
While coverage of BCG, DPT and measles immunization statistically increased during the study period, the proportion of children who received the third dose of polio vaccine decreased from 93.3% (95% CI: 92.7-93.9) to 88.1% (95% CI: 86.8-89.3).


METHODS
A non-blinded, household-randomized, controlled study was performed between February 2014 and June 2015 in 32 shanty towns in Peru.
It included patients being treated for tuberculosis and their household contacts.
Households were randomly assigned to either the standard of care provided by Peru's national tuberculosis programme (control arm) or the same standard of care plus socioeconomic support (intervention arm).
Socioeconomic support comprised conditional cash transfers up to 230 United States dollars per household, community meetings and household visits.
Rates of tuberculosis preventive therapy initiation and treatment success (i.e. cure or treatment completion) were compared in intervention and control arms.

FINDINGS
Overall, 282 of 312 (90%) households agreed to participate: 135 in the intervention arm and 147 in the control arm.
These improvements were equitable, being independent of household poverty.


METHODS
Seven studies were included in a qualitative analysis and four in a random-effects meta-analysis.

FINDINGS
Due to heterogeneity (I2: 83%), further pooled estimates were not possible.


METHODS
Then we systematically searched online databases for evaluations of improved oxygen systems in hospitals in low- or middle-income countries.
We extracted data on the effectiveness, processes and underlying theory of selected projects, and used these data to test the candidate theories and identify the features of successful projects.

FINDINGS
These used various approaches to improving oxygen therapy, and reported clinical, quality of care and technical outcomes.
Four effectiveness studies demonstrated positive clinical outcomes for childhood pneumonia, with large variation between programmes and hospitals.
We identified factors that help or hinder success, and proposed a practical framework depicting the key requirements for hospitals to effectively provide oxygen therapy to children.


METHODS
We assigned surveys conducted before the launch (2003-2008) as baseline surveys and surveys conducted between 2009-2014 as endpoint surveys.
We did country-level and pooled multicountry analyses.
Pooled analyses based on malaria transmission risk, were done by dividing geographical zones into either low- and intermediate-risk or high-risk.
To assess changes in equity, we calculated the Lorenz concentration curve and concentration index (C-index).

FINDINGS
Four countries displayed worsened equity, two favouring the poorer households and two favouring the richer.
Similar trends were seen in both low- and intermediate-risk and high-risk zones.


METHODS
From November to December 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of facilities and health workers and we observed the health workers' interactions with febrile children and their caregivers.
We also conducted exit interviews with caregivers to collect information on demographic characteristics, chief complaints, counselling and drug dispensing practices.

FINDINGS
Facilities were insufficiently staffed, stocked and equipped to adequately manage childhood fever.
Children most commonly presented with upper respiratory tract infections (46%; 69), diarrhoea (31%; 27) and malaria (10%; 16).
Health workers insufficiently evaluated children for danger signs, and less than half (47%; 9/19) of children with pneumonia received appropriate antibiotic treatment.
Only 57% (92/161) were tested for malaria using either rapid diagnostic tests or microscopy.


METHODS
Providers were assessed using hypothetical patient vignettes and the standardized patient method both before and after programme implementation, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.


FINDINGS
Of the enrolled patients, 8404 (63%) achieved comprehensive retention 12 months after enrolment in care.


APPROACH
In 2007, the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and the Malagasy Ministry of Public Health implemented a countrywide system for the prospective syndromic and virological surveillance of influenza-like illnesses.
In assessing this system's performance, we identified gaps and ways to promote the best use of resources.

RELEVANT CHANGES
By 2014, the system covered 34 sentinel sites across the country.
Data quality for all evaluated indicators was categorized as above 90% and the system also appeared to be strong in terms of its acceptability, simplicity and stability.
However, sample collection needed improvement.


RESULTS
From 556 screened patients, data on 327 kidney transplant recipients are included.
First BPAR occurred in 54 (16.5%) patients.


KEY FINDINGS
(2) Regardless of the research program, there are various strategies and opportunities for engagement of patients with lived experience across the various stages of research in kidney disease.


LIMITATIONS
The Métis Nation of Ontario Citizenship Registry only captures about 20% of Métis people in Ontario.


CONCLUSIONS
Improvements in care of individuals with kidney disease could reduce these costs.


RESULTS
In addition, a long delay was significantly associated with "poor" or "fair" perceived mental health and the greatest number of activity limitations.

CONCLUSION
These findings affirm that a long delay in diagnosis is associated with negative health outcomes among Canadian adults with mood and/or anxiety disorders.


RESULTS
While 51.0% of the Canadians affected were not exercising to help manage their mood and/or anxiety disorders, 23.8% were exercising from 1 to 3 times a week, and 25.3% were exercising 4 or more times a week.
Individuals with a mood disorder (with or without anxiety) and those with physical comorbidities were less likely to exercise regularly.
The most frequently cited barriers for not exercising at least once a week were as follows: prevented by physical condition (27.3%), time constraints/too busy (24.1%) and lack of will power/self-discipline (15.8%).


CONCLUSIONS
Various socio-demographic and socio-professional factors are associated and contribute to increase the level of affect.
Burnout seems to be a vicious somato-psycho-somatic disorder.


INTRODUCTION
Systemic sclerosis is a rare auto immune disease characterized by a local or diffuse skin condition and a variable visceral impairment.
The most frequent are the anti topoisomerase 1 or anti Scl 70 and the anti-centromeres.

CONCLUSION
Auto antibodies other than the antitopoisomerase and anti-centromere have been found in patients with scleroderma in our cohort.
Certain links exist between the presence of a given antibody and clinical features.


CONCLUSION
this quality study analyzed the percentage of patient management cases and incorrect diagnoses in the emergency department.


CONCLUSIONS
We noted improvement in late referrals and early dialysis initiation over time.


RESULTS
NTA identified particles in the size range of 30 to 900 nm, with a mean of 240 (SE: 10 nm).
MP levels increased in a progressive manner during a 4-hour PD dwell.
Electron microscopy confirmed size and morphology of vesicles consistent with characteristics of MPs as well as the presence of mesothelin on the surface.


METHODS
An anonymous survey was administered to all residents in 9 surgical disciplines in Canada.
Significance of association was determined using the Pearson χ2 test.
The Canadian Post-MD Education Registry (CAPER) website was used to calculate the response rate.

RESULTS
We received 523 responses (27.6% response rate).
Of these respondents, 140 (26.8%) were either "somewhat" or "seriously" considering leaving their program.


RESULTS
In total, 122 patients were impanted with an LVAD during the study period.
Eight patients required LVAD exchange, and 1 patient had 2 replacements (9 of 122, 7.3%).
There were 7 HeartMate II (HMII), 1 HVAD and 1 DuraHeart pumps exchanged.
Two of these exchanges occurred early at the time of initial implant, whereas 7 occurred late (range 8-623 d).
Six exchanges were made owing to pump thrombosis.
The mean support time before exchange was 225 days, and time from exchange to transplant, death or ongoing support was 245 days.
Three patients were successfully bridged to transplant, and at the time of data collection 2 were supported awaiting transplant.
Three patients died after a mean duration of 394.3 days (range 78-673 d) of support postreplacement.
Four cases were successfully performed using a subcostal approach.


RESULTS
A total of 167 consecutive patients were included in the study.
Median age was 66 (range 27-88) years, and 46.1% (n = 77) of patients were men.
The majority of patients (n = 141, 84%) underwent robotic lobectomy.
Median duration of surgery was 270 (interquartile range [IQR] 233-326) minutes, and median length of stay (LOS) was 4 (IQR 3-6) days.
Twelve patients (7%) were converted to thoracotomy.
Total duration of surgery and console time decreased significantly (p < 0.001) across tertiles, with a steady decline until case 20, followed by a plateau effect.
Across tertiles, there was no significant difference in LOS, number of lymph node stations removed, or perioperative complications.

CONCLUSION
The results of this case series are comparable to those reported in the literature.
We have presented the first consecutive case series of robotic lobectomy in Canada.


CONCLUSION
Haitian physicians, residents and medical students responded favourably to the OTS.
Open-ended questions offered concise, attainable improvements for future iterations of the course.


RESULTS
We included the cases of 75 patients in our analysis: 54 received a supracoronary tube graft and 21 received a root replacement.
The proximal tear was identified below the sinotubular junction in all patients in the root group and in 61% of patients in the supracoronary group.
We detected no differences between the groups for in-hospital mortality, length of stay, or complications.
Long-term follow-up demonstrated a greater incidence of 2+ aortic regurgitation among patients in the supracoronary group than the root group (29.7% v. 0.0%, p = 0.006); however, there was no difference between the groups in symptoms or reoperation.

CONCLUSION
However, we found no difference between the groups in mortality, reoperation or New York Heart Association class.


RESULTS
We reviewed the charts of 2769 primary bariatric clinic patients, 886 of whom had bariatric surgery, and 534 revision bariatric clinic patients, 83 of whom had revision surgery.
Fewer revision clinic patients underwent surgery than primary clinic patients (22% v. 32%).
The mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 44.7 ± 9.5 in revision patients compared with 45.7 ± 7.6 in primary bariatric surgery patients.
Most revision patients had a prior vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG; 48%) or a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB; 24%).
Bands were removed in 36% of all LAGB patients presenting to clinic.
Of the 134 procedures performed in the revision clinic, 83 were bariatric weight loss surgeries, and 51 were band removals.
Complications were significantly more frequent in revision patients than primary patients (41% v. 15%, p < 0.001).


RESULTS
There was 1 revision in each group.
Wear rate was lower with crosslinked polyethylene than conventional polyethylene (0.04 ± 0.02 mm/year v. 0.08 ± 0.03 mm/year, p = 0.007).


METHODS
We assessed prospectively 10 key indicators of inappropriate paediatric case management, as indicated by WHO guidelines.
The primary indicator was the combination of the three indicators: unnecessary hospitalization, increased iatrogenic risk and unnecessary painful procedures.
An independent team evaluated the overall quality of care.

FINDINGS
We prospectively reviewed the medical records of 4626 hospitalized children aged 2 to 60 months.
At 1 year, the risk ratio for the primary indicator in the intervention versus the control group was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.13).
The proportions of the other nine indicators also decreased in the intervention group (P < 0.0001 for all).
Overall quality of care improved significantly in intervention hospitals.


METHODS
Based on World Health Organization protocols, we created indices of process quality for antenatal care (first visits) and for sick-child visits.

FINDINGS
Data were available for 2594 and 11  402 observations of clinical consultations for antenatal care and sick children, respectively.
Overall, health-care providers performed a mean of 62.2% (interquartile range, IQR: 50.0 to 75.0) of eight recommended antenatal care actions and 54.5% (IQR: 33.3 to 66.7) of nine sick-child care actions at observed visits.
Private facilities outperformed public facilities.
Country differences were more influential in explaining variance in quality than all other factors combined.


METHODS
We examined unadjusted differences in quality between the public and private facilities.
Multilevel linear mixed-effects models were used to adjust for birth attendant, facility and maternal characteristics.

FINDINGS
The quality of care we observed was generally poor in both private and public facilities; the mean percentage of essential clinical care practices completed for each woman was 35.7%.


FINDINGS
The annual incidence of medical malpractice litigation increased from 75 in 2010 to 6947 in 2014.
Most cases related to general surgery (1350 litigations), internal medicine (3500 litigations), obstetrics and gynaecology (1251 litigations) and orthopaedics (1283 litigations).
Most of the reported injuries were either minor (1358 injuries) or fatal (4111 deaths).
Of the 11 014 plaintiffs with known litigation outcomes, 7482 (67.9%) received monetary compensation.

CONCLUSION
Over our study period, the incidence of litigation over potential medical malpractice increased in China.


METHODS
In 2010-2014, we used a situational analysis tool to collect data at district and regional hospitals in Bangladesh (n = 14), the Plurinational State of Bolivia (n = 18), Ethiopia (n = 19), Guatemala (n = 20), the Lao People's Democratic Republic (n = 12), Liberia (n = 12) and Rwanda (n = 25).
Hospital sites were selected by pragmatic sampling.
Data were geocoded and then analysed using an online data visualization platform.


METHODS
Six of the indicators are about maternal health, five are for newborn health and four are general cross-cutting indicators.

FINDINGS
Of the indicators evaluated, 10 were clearly defined, of which four could be applied directly in the field and six would require revisions to operationalize them.
Information on emergency obstetric complications was not recorded in a standard manner, thus limiting the reliability of the information.


METHODS
We updated previous meta-analyses of published cluster randomized trials of community-based interventions for neonatal survival.
For each study we extracted baseline data on the context: geographical area; available facilities and staffing; immediate breastfeeding and facility births; and neonatal mortality.

FINDINGS
We included 17 trials, spanning years from 2001 to 2013.
We observed some evidence that community approaches had a stronger effect in south Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa.
Community approaches had a lower impact on neonatal mortality in settings where at least 44% of women delivered in a facility.


APPROACH
We developed and tested a method of measuring the quality of maternal and neonatal care that could be embedded in a larger national performance management initiative.
The tool used direct observations and medical record reviews to score quality in nine domains of intrapartum care.

LESSONS LEARNT
The method was feasible, requiring a total of 3 days and two to three trained data collectors per hospital visit.
With additional replication studies, this tool may be useful in other low- and middle-income countries.


RESULTS
Preoperatively, there was no difference in clinical and biological items between the two groups.
The sperm concentration was higher at 6 months in the percutaneous embolization group (13.42, vs. 8.1×106/ml; p = 0.043).
With a median follow-up of 4 years, 27 pregnancies occurred (spontaneous pregnancy rate of 35.5%).
There was no significant difference between procedures on the sperm quality, pregnancy rate, and the overall satisfaction.


RESULTS
Forty-three patients (55.1%) received at least 1 steroid-sparing agent, and of these, 18 (41.8%) received a calcineurin inhibitor.


RESULTS
The sample included more women (59.7%) than men (40.3%) and the mean (standard deviation) age was 47.1 (15.6) years.
RW participation was associated with path/cycleway length (OR = 1.17; 1.05 to 1.31).
VPA minutes was associated with tree density (B = 7.28 minutes/week; 0.39 to 14.17).


RESULTS
Similar patterns were observed for First Nations off reserve.


INTRODUCTION
Youth obesity rates in Canada continue to rise.


RESULTS
Less than half of patients received follow-up tests after an initial abnormal kidney function result.
Most patients with chronic kidney disease received regular monitoring of serum creatinine (91%), but urine albumin-to-creatinine monitoring was lower (70%).
Among patients 66 to 80 years of age with chronic kidney disease, 65% were on a statin.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
1.


CASE REPORT
A CT scanner suggests the presence of a gastro- esophageal-pericardial fistula.
Despite early antibiotics with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, the patient dies five days after the drainage.


METHODS
We assessed changes in the facilities' essential drug stocks, equipment maintenance and clinical obstetric care processes.

FINDINGS
The scheme improved the availability of both functional equipment and essential drug stocks in the intervention facilities.


METHODS
Compliance was assessed in five domains: hand hygiene; protective glove use; injections and blood sampling; disinfection of reusable equipment; and waste segregation.


METHODS
We used BLASTP to find regions of identity between viruses.
We assessed accessibility of protein fragments by calculating the solvent accessible surface area for the envelope and nonstructural-1 (NS1) proteins.

FINDINGS
The list includes protein fragments from all Zika virus proteins, except NS3.
NS4A has the highest number (190 k-mers) of protein fragments on the list.


RESULTS
Of the 30 patients included in the chart review, 12 (40%) received an intervention.
A total of 8 (27%) patients experienced an adverse drug reaction (ADR), such as drowsiness and dizziness.

CONCLUSIONS
The current recommendation from tertiary drug references is to reduce the dose of lorazepam by 50% when this drug is coadministered with valproic acid.
However, this recommendation could not be validated through an analysis of patients exposed to this interaction in the clinical setting or through a review of the literature.


METHODS
A retrospective design was used to review data for adult patients admitted to an internal medicine service from June 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015.

CONCLUSIONS
A wide variety of thiamine prescribing patterns were noted.


METHODS
Microsoft Excel was used to develop a Markov model.
Model parameters were determined using published literature, local hospital data, expert opinion, and chart review.
Effectiveness was measured in terms of QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated.


RESULTS
Of 225 patients identified as being at risk of VTE, 179 (79.6%) received appropriate prophylaxis.
The rate of appropriate VTE prophylaxis was lower than that reported in local audits (79.6% versus 97.6%; p = 0.002).


CONCLUSIONS
The study provided limited evidence to support the use of tapering.
However, tapering can be used to identify the lowest effective dose and may increase patient comfort with deprescribing.


RESULTS
When limiting the analysis to types of cancer associated with high BMI, the PAF increased to 14.9% (males 17.5%, females 13.3%).
Irrespective of sex or type of cancer, PAFs were highest in the Prairies (except Alberta) and the Atlantic region and lowest in British Columbia and Quebec.


RESULTS
The increase in multimorbidity prevalence with increasing age was similar across provinces.
The difference in prevalence for males and females varied by province and territory.
We observed substantial variation in estimates over time.
were consistent for the two definitions of multimorbidity.

CONCLUSION
Further expansion of the CCDSS in the number and breadth of validated case definitions will improve the accuracy of multimorbidity surveillance for the Canadian population.


RESULTS
The dose conversion ratio was 280:1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 197-362:1) at the end of the run-in phase, 360:1 (95% CI: 262-457:1) at the 3-month point of the active phase, and 382:1 (95% CI: 235-529:1) at the 6-month point of the active phase.
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in weekly iron dose, Hb, serum ferritin, or transferrin saturation.
The number of dose changes and the time to Hb stability were similar.


METHODS
The second assessor was blinded to the outcome of the first.
To assess satisfaction with the APP, patients completed a modified version of the validated Visit-specific Questionnaire.

RESULTS
The sample included 102 participants (54 women) with a mean age of 54.3 ± 14.3 years and a mean Oswestry Disability Index score of 35.4 ± 16.6.
The assessors' overall agreement was 86%.
The κ coefficient for the need for a surgical consultation was 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.84).
The APP identified that 77% of patients did not require a surgical consultation.
Twenty-one patients underwent surgery.
Satisfaction scores for the APP were very high (mean score 92 out of 100).


RESULTS
Stymied enrolment resulted in only 16 patients being included in our analyses.
The RSA data indicated statistically greater coronal plane migration in the keeled glenoid group than in the pegged group at 12 and 24 months.


RESULTS
Donor and recipient characteristics of DCD and NDD groups were similar with respect to age, sex, body mass index, kidney and pancreas cold ischemia times, and donor terminal creatinine.
Mean DCD graft warm ischemia time was 0.5 (range 0.4-0.7) hours.
Median follow-up was 2.2 (range 0.1-6.7) years and 2.7 (range 0.3-6.3) years for the DCD and NDD groups, respectively.
The DCD and NDD groups were similar with regards to recipient percent panel reactive antibody and presence of human leukocyte antigen antibodies.
The groups also received similar total doses of thymoglobulin.
In total 38% of patients in the DCD group experienced renal delayed graft function (DGF) compared with 10% in the NDD group (p = 0.027).
There were 7 cases of pancreas graft thrombosis requiring relaparotomy in the NDD group compared with none in the DCD group.
No patients from either group required insulin at any time after transplant.
Although the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in the DCD than the NDD group on postoperative days 7 and 14 (p = 0.025), no difference was noted on day 30 or through 4 years after transplant.


RESULTS
We found no significant difference in age, sex, ASA classification, number of laminectomy levels, or estimated blood loss between the 2 cohorts.
There was 1 readmission within 30 days that occurred in the first cohort.


RESULTS
We included 49 patients in our analysis: 25 who received TA and 24 who did not.
There were no statistical differences in demographics between the groups.
The rate of transfusion in the TA group was 4% compared with 67% in the non-TA group (p < 0.001).
The net hemoglobin loss in the TA group was 4.1 g/dL versus 6.2 g/dL in the non-TA group (p < 0.001).
The use of TA was found to be associated with a greater than 99% reduced risk of receiving a transfusion (odds ratio 0.003, 95% confidence interval < 0.001-0.072, p < 0.001).
There were no thromboembolic events in patients who received TA, and there was 1 pulmonary embolus in the non-TA group.
Postoperative LOS was significantly reduced in the TA group (mean difference 1.1 d, p = 0.005).


RESULTS
Excellent image quality was obtained in the form of opacification and demarcation of the liver segment to which the duct belongs.

CONCLUSION
It is a simple and inexpensive technique that can be performed with minimal resources.


CONCLUSIONS
The prevalence of bullying in adolescent patients presenting to emergency departments is high.


RESULTS
Overall, residents reported that they "mostly" agreed with the involvement of family in the assessment and treatment of ED.
Residents' endorsement of family involvement in both domains increased according to the extent of ED training received.

CONCLUSIONS
Many residents endorse family involvement in both assessment and treatment; however, understanding of the nature of such involvement is often vague.


OBJECTIVE
Innovative strategies that facilitate the use of high quality practice guidelines (PG) are needed.
The National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) is a free, international online repository.
We investigated whether it is a trustworthy source of child and youth anxiety and depression PGs.

RESULTS
Eight eligible PGs were identified (depression, n=6; anxiety and depression, n=1; social anxiety disorder, n=1).


RESULTS
Of 720 admissions, 83 (11.5%) involved the prescription of night-time only quetiapine, and 47 of the 83 (57%) were for insomnia only.
Mean age was 15.4 years; mean maximum dose was 41.2 mg.
Most patients (81%) had no documented history of prior sedative trials.

CONCLUSIONS
Quetiapine is used not infrequently for the management of insomnia in adolescents in tertiary mental health settings.


CONCLUSION
Both history of physical or sexual abuse and self-destructive behaviors are rooted in relational problems.
The results show that these are related to one another among those adolescent girls.


RESULTS
However, there was no significant difference compared with 2 time periods immediately before and after the campaign.
The registration rate in London did not significantly differ from Kitchener-Waterloo.


RESULTS
A complete ST-resolution (≥50%) was observed in 72.9% of the patients.
In-hospital complications were observed in 31.2% of patients.
The patients with a lower baseline TIMI flow (P = 0.03) and those who developed complications (P = 0.04) had lower levels of free testosterone.
A significant positive correlation was observed between the left ventricular function and serum levels of free testosterone (P = 0.01 and r = +0.362).


RESULTS
Peritonitis rates were better than internationally recommended standards.

CONCLUSIONS
Incremental PD is feasible in a contemporary PD population treated mainly with APD.


RESULTS
The results of this study raised themes related to the sources participants use, to their interests and to ways of engaging young adults.
Prevention programs should make use of traditional sources, such as peers, family members and medical professionals, as well as emerging technologies, such as social media.
Choice of sources was related to the perceived authority of and trust associated with the source.
Engaging young adults means using relatable messages that are short and encourage small changes.
Small gender-based differences were found in the information-seeking interests of participants.
Differences related to age were not examined.


RESULTS
In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing duration of rotating shift work.


FINDINGS
The mean annual investment (US$ 27 million) per person at risk (574 million) was US$ 0.05 (standard deviation: 0.03).

CONCLUSION
The locally transmitted malaria burden in China has decreased.


METHODS
Using randomized controlled trial data, we compared infants weighing 2.00-2.49, 1.50-1.99 and < 1.50 kg with non-low-birth-weight infants.


METHODS
The primary outcome was treatment success.
When possible, we also evaluated, death, loss to follow-up, treatment adherence and health-system costs.
To obtain pooled relative risk (RR) estimates, we performed random-effects meta-analyses.

FINDINGS
Eight studies met the eligibility criteria for review inclusion.
Six cohort studies, with 4026 participants in total, reported on treatment outcomes.
Two of three studies evaluating health-care costs reported lower costs for the decentralized models of care than for the centralized models.


RELEVANT CHANGES
In August 2016, the Thai government endorsed a national strategic plan on antimicrobial resistance that comprised six strategic actions and five targets.
A national system for the surveillance of antimicrobial consumption has also been initiated.

LESSONS LEARNT
A robust monitoring and evaluation platform now contributes to evidence-based interventions.
An integrated system for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance still needs to be established.


CONCLUSION
Very long-term survival ( ≥ 20 yr) was observed in 30% of patients transplanted during the first decade of our experience.


CONCLUSIONS
Research should examine whether particular forms of support improve maternal and newborn health outcomes.


Results
Objectors had varied perspectives.
Three types of objectors were evident: extreme, moderate and partial.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Male partners with or without a medical history of reproductive organ diseases (cryptorchidism, varicocele, orchitis, testicular torsion) were eligible for the study.
There were 382 men evaluated from May 2014 to November 2016, all of whom completed a self-administered questionnaire on general lifestyle habits.
Then all men underwent semen analysis.
A total of 382 men aged 26 to 67 years (median age 39 year interquartile range 37-42) were recruited.

MAIN RESULTS
A total of 46.3% reported having sleep disturbances.

RESULTS
The mean age and standard deviation was 81.4 ± 9.0 years.
The mean modified Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 3.4 ± 2.8.

LIMITATIONS
Generalizability to non-Canadian settings may be limited.


CONCLUSIONS
Aortic blood pressure is also better associated with cardiovascular outcomes.


LIMITATIONS
We do not have long-term follow-up on patients triaged as low risk.


DESIGN AND METHODS
Descriptive statistics were used in analyzing the responses.

RESULTS
Survival estimation is most frequently based on clinical gestalt.


PARTICIPANTS
PRIMARY


METHODS
These estimates were then compared with the corresponding numbers of hospitalizations observed.


METHODS
We used the value-of-a-life-year method to estimate the broader economic and social value of living longer, in better health, as a result of immunization.

FINDINGS
The broader economic and social value of these vaccinations is estimated at US$ 820 billion.


APPROACH
Point-of-care tests for syphilis and syphilis interventions were integrated into the existing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and control programme.


METHODS
This prospective exploratory study was conducted over 4 weeks in February and March 2016.
Data were collected using the self-administered BPMH form, patient interviews, and a data collection form.

CONCLUSIONS
Most of the patients interviewed by the pharmacy team were able to complete the BPMH form with no clinically significant discrepancies.


METHODS
The mean concentration of plerixafor (μmol/L), standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and bias were determined on days 2, 3, 11, 17, 24, and 31.


METHODS
Frequency of reporting by pharmacists at the intervention campus was compared with reporting at a control campus of the same hospital.
Data were collected prospectively over a 6-month pilot period, starting in April 2015.


METHODS
We conducted an online survey of Canadian pediatric critical care physicians.

RESULTS
The 68 physicians who replied (61% of potential respondents) had a median of 12 (interquartile range 5-20) years of experience.
Forty-four (65%) of the respondents stated that a large, rigorous RCT of stress ulcer prophylaxis in children is needed, and 94% (62 of 66) indicated that it should include a placebo group.
The 3 most common designs suggested were a 3-arm trial comparing PPI, H2RA, and placebo (56% [37 of 66 respondents to this question]) and 2-arm trials comparing PPI with placebo (15% [n = 10]) and H2RA with placebo (8% [n = 5]).
Most respondents indicated a willingness to participate in an RCT (64% [42 of 66 respondents to this question]), whereas some (29% [n = 19]) indicated that participation would depend on trial design or funding; only 8% (n = 5) were disinclined to participate.


INTRODUCTION
Food marketing impacts children's food knowledge, behaviours and health.

RESULTS
Research trends suggest that unhealthy foods are targeted at children using multiple promotional techniques that overlap across settings.
Several research gaps exist in this area, leading to an incomplete, and potentially underestimated, picture of food marketing to children in Canada.
Available evidence suggests that current Canadian approaches have not reduced children's exposure to or the power of food marketing in these settings, with the exception of some positive influences from Quebec's statutory regulations.


RESULTS
Reliability analyses revealed satisfactory results for most indicators.


RESULTS
Twenty-five school representatives (8 elementary, 17 secondary) participated.
Only two schools achieved the highest rating (maintenance) in Time II.
Supports aligned with P/PM 150 were reportedly influenced by administration buy-in, stakeholder support and relevancy to local context.


INTRODUCTION
To address challenges Canadians face within their food environments, a comprehensive, multistakeholder, intergovernmental approach to policy development is essential.
Food environment indicators are needed to assess population status and change.
The Ontario Food and Nutrition Strategy (OFNS) integrates the food, agriculture and nutrition sectors, and aims to improve the health of Ontarians through actions that promote healthy food systems and environments.


RESULTS
The HIV-1 virus loads in 1396 synchronized blood and semen samples were measured, and antiretroviral treatment, biological and epidemiological data were recorded.


CONCLUSION
This disparity may result from inadequate housing, overcrowding or limited access to clean water.


RESULTS
82 athletes participated in the study.
Respondents sustained over two injuries per year.
Significant differences were found for sport category and type of injury.


RESULTS
Original search strategies retrieved 1301 citations; 47 articles were used for qualitative synthesis and 31 for meta-analyses.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
S


CLINICAL FEATURES
Prior to presentation, the patient had received a working diagnosis of levator ani syndrome.

SUMMARY
Anorectal pain is complex and multifactorial and a diagnosis such as an abscess should not be overlooked.


RESULTS
For all 25 patients, a change was observed in the mean VAS scores from 7.7 to 1.8.
The mean number of treatments was 5.3 over an average of 3.0 weeks.
No adverse events were reported.


RESULTS
There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients receiving surgery within the benchmark.

CONCLUSION
Regionalization appeared to improve the timeliness of surgery and may have reduced mortality.


METHODS
We evaluated antibiotic use (perioperative prophylaxis and treatment) for appropriateness based on published guidelines.

RESULTS
During the study period 453 patients were admitted to the acute care surgery service, and 229 underwent surgery.
The most common diagnoses were small bowel obstruction (27.2%) and acute cholecystitis (11.0%).
In total 251 nonelective abdominal operations were performed, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was appropriate in 49.5% of cases.
The most common prophylaxis errors were incorrect timing (15.5%) and incorrect dose (12.4%).
Overall 206 patients received treatment with antibiotics for their underlying disease process, and 44.2% received appropriate first-line drug therapy.
The most common therapeutic errors were administration of second- or third-line antibiotics without indication (37.9%) and use of antibiotics when not indicated (12.1%).
There was considerable variation in the duration of treatment for patients with the same diagnoses.


RESULTS
The LOS risk-adjustment model predicted 29% of the variation in LOS.


METHODS
We used Mann-Whitney, Fisher exact and Kaplan-Meier log-rank tests to analyze differences between groups.

RESULTS
Seven of 179 (3.9%) patients with abdominal liposarcoma had inguinoscrotal liposarcoma, and 6 of 168 (3.6%) patients with RLPS had extension to the inguinal canal.
No differences were observed between groups in sex (p > 0.99), mean age (49.7 ± 6.4 yr v. 52.1 ± 12.5 yr, p = 0.37), laterality (p > 0.99) or scrotal involvement (40.0% v. 66.7%, p = 0.57).
The RLPS group had significantly larger tumours than the inguinoscrotal group (27.9 ± 6.8 cm v. 7.8 ± 4.2 cm, p = 0.001).
Postoperative complications were significantly more common in the RLPS group (n = 4, 83.3%); patients in the inguinoscrotal group experienced no postoperative complications (p = 0.021).
However, inoperable disease-free survival was significantly poorer in the RLPS group (p = 0.010).


RESULTS
From September 2004 to November 2016, 13 patients (12 men, mean age 45 ± 13 yr) received the TAH for refractory cardiogenic shock secondary to idiopathic (56%) or ischemic (17%) cardiomyopathy and to other various causes (33%).
Before implantation, mean ejection fraction was 14% ± 4%, 7 (54%) patients had previous cardiac surgery, 4 (31%) were on mechanical ventilation, and 3 (23%) patients were on dialysis.
The mean duration of TAH support was 46 ± 40 days.
Three (23%) patients died while on support after a mean of 15 days.
Actuarial survival on support was 77% ± 12% at 30 days after implantation.
Complications on support included stroke (n = 1, 8%), acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged intubation (n = 5, 38%) and acute renal failure requiring temporary dialysis (n = 5, 38%).
Ten (77%) patients survived to be transplanted after a mean of 52 ± 42 days of support.
Actuarial survival rates after transplant were 67% ± 16% at 1 month and 56% ± 17% at 1 year after transplantation.


RESULTS
In total, 224 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for a benign or malignant colonic lesion during the study period.
All patients had a complete colonoscopy preoperatively.
In all, 148 patients (66%) had their lesion tattooed at endoscopy.
Most lesions were tattooed distally, but 15% were tattooed either proximally, both proximally and distally, or tattooed without specifying location as proximal or distal.
Tattoo localization was accurate in 69% of cases.
Tattooed lesions were not visible during surgery 21.5% of time; 2 cases were converted to open surgery to identify the lesion.
Inaccuracy in endoscopic localization led to change in surgical plan in 16% of surgeries.
In the nontattooed group, 1 case was converted to open surgery to localize the lesion, 3 required intraoperative colonoscopy and 1 had positive margins on final pathology.


RESULTS
Among women with complications, the proportion presenting with hemorrhage increased significantly, from 27% to 48%.


METHODS
A convenience sample of 742 male and female undergraduate and graduate students was recruited from five nonmedical public and private universities in Iran in 2014.
Respondents' awareness of and knowledge about STIs were assessed using a validated questionnaire.
A total of 49%, 42% and 9% of the respondents had low, moderate and high STI knowledge scores, respectively.


METHODS
Logistic and multinomial regression were used to identify individual and family characteristics associated with multipartner fertility.

RESULTS
Among those with multiple children, 33% of mothers and 41% of fathers had had children with more than one partner.
Multipartner fertility was associated with lower current household wealth among mothers, and with increased risk of single parenthood and higher fertility among mothers and fathers.


METHODOLOGY
bibliographic research.
Diagnostic


CONCLUSION
neuropathic pain is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome.


RESULTS
Dividing oocytes between two fertilization techniques reduce the rate of total fertilization failure during the first IVF cycle.
No statistical difference were observed for 2 pronuclei (PN) rate between the two techniques.


RESULTS
Twenty-one patients at the Canadian site and 8 patients at the US site participated.
Mean total costs were US $1581 ± $1965 and $2179 (range: $1421-$2741) at the Canadian and US sites, respectively.
HRQoL increased significantly after surgery (P<0.05).
Improvements in HRQOL directly related to surgery were not significantly different between patients in Canada and the United States.
Sensitivity analyses confirmed that these results were robust.


RESULTS
Sixty-three patients met our inclusion criteria.
Of these, 55 (87%) had cleft palate and 17 (27%) were syndromic.
Forty-eight (76%) patients were managed by prone positioning.


RESULTS
Of 61 patients with macrocystic lymphatic malformations, 7 cases (11.5%; 4 females, 3 males) resolved spontaneously.
All but 1 case was associated with local or upper respiratory tract infection antecedent to resolution.
Six of the 7 lesions were located in the neck.

CONCLUSION
Among the cases reviewed, there was a common theme of upper respiratory tract or local infection antecedent to spontaneous lesion resolution.
Compared to the literature, our proportion of malformations presenting after birth and the proportion of malformations presenting in the neck region were higher than those of other series.
Although side effects associated with treatment are generally mild and/or rare, risks related to sclerotherapy and the accompanying requirement for general anesthesia in pediatric populations nevertheless exist.


RESULTS
Four RCTs with a total of 264 participants were included.
The combined irrigation of bupivacaine and ketorolac showed a clinically significant reduction of pain in the first postoperative hour and on postoperative day 5.
The irrigation with bupivacaine compared with placebo significantly reduced pain assessed on postoperative day 4.


RESULTS
As with previous studies, medical students showed a gap in knowledge with respect to plastic surgery.
Focus groups revealed that television plays a large role in shaping their ideas of plastic surgery.


RESULTS
This study identified several variations in the anatomical structures of the Guyon canal reported in the literature.


RESULTS
The amount of soft tissue oedema and the mobility of the volar plate were factors used to determine return to full mobilization.
Mean extension-stop-splint wear was 16 ± 2 days.
In 51 patients, the postoperative follow-up was free of complications at 4 months.
After this time, 5 patients had a residual contracture of 10° to 15°.

CONCLUSION
Avulsion fractures of the volar plate at the PIP joint are common.


RESULTS
Common patient reasons for not pursuing IBR were referring physician objection and not having adequate knowledge.
Women expressed wanting to discuss reconstruction at the time of cancer diagnosis.


RESULTS
No clinical complications were observed during follow-up period.
In radiological evaluation, there was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding bone formation.


RESULTS
Firstly, the disposable stimulator can only deliver 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mA stimuli, while the anesthesia device can deliver stimuli of 0.1 to 5 mA (in 0.1 mA increments).
Secondly, the disposable stimulator frequently fails to operate during surgery, and this is not experienced with the anesthesia device.
Finally, the cost of disposables is less using the anesthesia device.


CONCLUSIONS
Shedding of particulate matter from the implant surfaces can be precipitated by moderate adhesion.


CONCLUSIONS
Using 3-dimensional vascular anatomical analysis, the number, location, length, type, and diameter of the SFAP were documented.
This is the first 3-dimensional vascular anatomical study to comprehensively document the vascular anatomy of the SFAP flap.


RESULTS
034 (statistically significant).


RESULTS
Perceived improvement was also largely favourable (mean 8.1/10; median 8.0/10).


RESULTS
Respondents to the survey (n = 92) expressed concern about their shopping experiences in three main areas: the cost of food, food quality and freshness, and availability of specific foods.

CONCLUSION
There is limited retail competition in the provincial Norths.
In Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Ontario, the NWC has no store competition in at least 70% of northern communities.


RESULTS
Finally, creative strategies to increase sales of fresh vegetables and fruits seemed to substantially increase revenue from these product categories.


INTRODUCTION
Furthermore, the complex methods often used in food desert research can be difficult to reproduce and communicate to key stakeholders.


OBJECTIVE
Digital technology may offer solutions, but the products often need to be adapted for primary care.


OBJECTIVE
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is common and debilitating with patients exhibiting persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions), repetitive ritualistic behaviours (compulsions) and anxiety.
While it is known that OCD is highly heritable, the specific genetic risk factors for OCD are still largely unknown.


RESULTS
While many precariously housed youth presented through the housing/outreach/support sector, 33.6% presented to other sectors.
Housing groups endorsed comparably high levels of internalizing and externalizing problems.
However, precariously housed youth reported higher rates of problematic substance use (OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.25, 1.88; p < 0.01) and crime/violence issues (OR = 1.95; 95% CI 1.54, 2.46; p < 0.01).


OBJECTIVE
Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BSD) is a severe psychiatric disorder associated with a host of deleterious sequelae.


Objectives
The primary objective was to determine pharmacists' overall level of competency for all components of the vancomycin prescribing procedure.

Results
The median overall competency rate, for all phases of prescribing, was 100% (interquartile range [IQR] 90.1%-100%).


Methods
NHPs used by CKD and transplant patients in British Columbia were identified from the records of the BC Provincial Renal Agency.
Each NHP was given 1 of 4 safety ratings: likely safe, possibly safe, possibly unsafe, and likely unsafe.

Results
The Herbal-CKD website (www.herbalckd.com) was created in 2015 to provide information about 47 commonly used NHPs and 2 known nephrotoxins (aristolochic acid and silver).


Results
The new drug policy was launched on October 1, 2014.

Conclusions
New and expensive drugs represent a challenge for clinicians and hospital stakeholders.


Results
In general, physicians were more likely to discuss fertility problems (33% vs. 7.5%, p<0.001) and menstrual cycle irregularities (15% vs. 9%, p=0.04) with CKD patients than other health care professionals.


Methods
Our approach aimed to obtain improved numerators and denominators for calculating coverage at the subnational level from health-facility data.

Findings
Our results indicated a stagnation of immunization coverage in almost all counties, a rapid increase of facility-based deliveries and caesarean sections and limited progress in antenatal care coverage.


Methods
Two malaria surveys were conducted in 2010-2011 and 2013-2014.
They included 77 and 92 randomly selected villages, respectively.
In addition, data were obtained from a malaria survey performed in 2008-2009.

Results
Prevalence decreased with altitude.
Plasmodium falciparum was more common than P. vivax overall, but not everywhere, and initially the prevalence of P. vivax infection decreased more slowly than P. falciparum infection.
Malaria infections were clustered in households.
In contrast to findings in 2008-2009, no significant association between net use and prevalence was found in the later two surveys.
The prevalence of both fever and splenomegaly also decreased but their association with malaria infection became stronger.


Methods
This index represents the percentage availability of 50 items that the World Health Organization considers essential for providing health care.
For our analysis we used 37-49 of the items on the list.
We used linear regression to assess the independent explanatory power of four national and four facility-level characteristics on reported service readiness.

Findings
The mean values for the service readiness index were 77% for the 636 hospitals and 52% for the 7807 health centres/clinics.
Deficiencies in medications and diagnostic capacity were particularly common.
There was weak correlation between national factors related to health financing and the readiness index.


Lessons learnt
The capacity of volunteers to enhance the quality of life of clients is affected by the local availability of care services.


Relevant changes
From our inpatient logs, we identified six patients with non-neonatal tetanus among male patients with a recent history of circumcision.
Only one of these patients had been circumcised within a subnational programme of voluntary medical male circumcision.
The other five had been circumcised outside of the programme - e.g. at small rural dispensaries or by a traditional provider with no formal medical training.
The six patients were aged 11-55 years and five (83%) of them died in hospital - all of overwhelming sepsis.


Results
In total, 120 patients were eligible for the correlation analyses.
We also observed that an elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was associated with a non-significant elevation of the ERI, although no direct correlation was found.


Methods
The population-based study involved residents of urban areas, where 80% of the Chilean population live, aged 20 years or older who had a myocardial infarction.
Regression discontinuity methods were used to estimate the near-immediate impact on disease incidence of enforcing smoke-free legislation in March 2013.
The same analysis was performed for ischaemic stroke, degenerative disc disease and colon cancer.
Data on the concentration of fine respirable particulates were included in an additional analysis of myocardial infarction incidence in the Santiago metropolitan area.

Results
Similar declines were observed in men and women and in people aged over and under 70 years.
The abrupt decline in myocardial infarction incidence was also observed when data on fine respirable particulates were included in an analysis for Santiago.


METHODS
We appraised the PJI guidelines from 3 academic medical societies, and consistent statements were aggregated.
We retrospectively reviewed all PJI cases in a tertiary care institution.
Surgeon adherence to preoperative, intraoperative, surgical and medical management guidelines was calculated, and we evaluated the association between guideline adherence and 2-year treatment outcomes.

RESULTS
Treatment success was 57.8% at 2 years.


RESULTS
We included 30 patients in our analysis (10 anterior, 10 posterior, and 10 lateral).
The groups were similar with respect to age (p = 0.27), body mass index (p = 0.16), and Charlson Comorbidity Index score (p = 0.66).
Temporal parameters were similar among the groups at all time points.
The anterior and posterior groups showed increased external rotation at 6 weeks (p = 0.003) and 12 weeks (p = 0.012) compared with the lateral group.


METHODS
We assessed baseline clinical characteristics, including Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) scores.

RESULTS
The median 6-month overall cost was $496 (interquartile range $140-$1948).


RESULTS
We evaluated 242 patients: 123 from the academic clinic (61 who used the decision aid and 62 controls) and 119 from the community clinic (59 who used the decision aid and 60 controls).
The effect of the decision aid on surgery rates did not differ between sites (p = 0.65).


RESULTS
Thirty-three patients underwent ALPPS during the study period: 16 in the early group (median age 65 yr, mean body mass index [BMI] 27) and 17 in the late group (median age 60 yr, mean BMI 25).
Bilobar disease was comparable in both groups (94% v. 88%, p > 0.99).
Duration of surgery was not statistically different.
Intraoperative blood loss and need for transfusion were significantly lower in the late group (200 ± 109 mL v. 100 ± 43 mL, p < 0.05).
The late group had a higher proportion of monosegment ALPPS (4:1).
There were no deaths within 90 days in either cohort.
Rates of postoperative complications were not statistically significant between groups.
The R0 resection rate was similar.
The entire 1-year disease-free and overall survival were 52% and 84%, respectively.


RESULTS
All 50 TAMIS procedures were successful.
The average lesion was 7 cm from the anal verge, the average tumour size was 2.5 cm, the average duration of surgery was 73 minutes, the average length of stay was 1.1 days, and the margin negativity was 84%.
Major indications in our series included 25 lesions that were too large for endoscopic resection, 14 early cancers or high-grade dysplasia, 10 margin checks postpolypectomy, 6 cases of recurrent polyposis, and 4 medically unfit patients.
There were no deaths.
The rate of short-term complications, including rectal bleeding, reoperation and urinary retention, was 16%.
The rate of long-term complications, including anal incontinence and stenosis, was 4%.
Benign and malignant recurrence rates were 2% and 6%, respectively.
Overall long-term requirement for invasive procedures, low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection, was 12%.


INTRODUCTION
breast conserving therapy remains the first choice in breast cancer care for the early stages.
Adequate surgical margins are essential to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence.
This study aims to identify risk factors of positive margins and locoregional recurrence.

CONCLUSION
It appears in our study that invasive lobular and multifocal tumors may present positive surgical margins.
Studies on pre- operative work-up are needed.
Biological factors of the tumor seem to play a fundamental role in the locoregional recurrence or persistence of the tumor.


Methods
The proportions calculated from the 2013 data were weighted to account for the sampling strategy.
We examined the association between the straight-line distances to the nearest primary health facility or hospital and uptake of maternity care.

Findings
The percentages of live births occurring in primary facilities and hospitals rose from 12% (2571/22 243) and 29% (6477/22 243), respectively, in 2007 to weighted values of 39% and 40%, respectively, in 2013.
Use of four or more antenatal visits appeared largely unaffected by survey year or the distance to the nearest antenatal clinic.


Approach
As part of the emergency response, existing plans to create mental health units within the existing hospital framework were brought forward.
Health-care staff attended mental well-being workshops on coping with stigma and stress.

Relevant changes
Half the patients (71) had mild distress or depression, anxiety disorders and grief or social problems, while 30 patients presented with psychosis requiring medication.
Fourteen non-specialist nurses received mental health awareness training.
Over 100 physicians, nurses and auxiliary staff participated in well-being workshops.


CONCLUSION
Future applications of the framework should be embedded in Indigenous research methodologies.


RESULTS
Approximately 14% of men and 12% of women reported alcohol consumption exceeding recommendations for cancer prevention.
Moreover, volume of daily alcohol consumption was positively associated with current tobacco use in both men and women.


Background
Kidney transplantation is the best treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease.

Results
Most studies used data registries.


Methods
The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority hired a pharmacist to develop and implement the pilot program from May 2015 to July 2016.
A referral form, consisting of consultation criteria used in primary care practices, was developed.

Results
A total of 197 referrals, involving 184 patients, were received during the pilot program; of these, 62 were excluded from analysis.
Acceptance rates for the pharmacist's recommendations were 90.2% (74 of 82 recommendations) among home care staff and 47.0% (55 of 117 recommendations) among prescribers and patients.
On average, 1.5 cpKPIs were identified for each referral.


Methods
The level of harm was determined independently by a pharmacist and a nurse practitioner using a defined scoring system.
In the event of disagreement, a nephrologist determined the final score.

Results
The mean number of discrepancies identified per patient was 1.31 (standard deviation 2.00).
Overall, 30% of these discrepancies were deemed to have the potential to cause moderate to severe patient discomfort or clinical deterioration.


INTRODUCTION
It is a means to increase local food production and thereby improve community health.

RESULTS
Some of the interns changed their grocery shopping habits and began purchasing more vegetables and questioning where and how the vegetables were produced.


Measurements
Patient demographics and comorbidities were documented.

Results
All patients enrolled in the study completed the survey.
The mean age of allochthonous patients was 65.5 years, whereas it was 54.6 years for native patients.
One non-native patient (1.5%) and 5 native patients (15.6%) died during the study period.


Results
Twenty-three studies with a total of 70 506 patients were included.
Quality of evidence was similarly low or very low in RCTs (due to imprecision) and observational studies (due to residual confounding and selection bias).


Results
We created separate equations for men and women based on weight and waist circumference.


METHODS
We assessed baseline clinical characteristics, including Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) scores.

RESULTS
The median 6-month overall cost was $496 (interquartile range $140-$1948).


RESULTS
We evaluated 242 patients: 123 from the academic clinic (61 who used the decision aid and 62 controls) and 119 from the community clinic (59 who used the decision aid and 60 controls).
The effect of the decision aid on surgery rates did not differ between sites (p = 0.65).


METHODS
We appraised the PJI guidelines from 3 academic medical societies, and consistent statements were aggregated.
We retrospectively reviewed all PJI cases in a tertiary care institution.
Surgeon adherence to preoperative, intraoperative, surgical and medical management guidelines was calculated, and we evaluated the association between guideline adherence and 2-year treatment outcomes.

RESULTS
Treatment success was 57.8% at 2 years.


RESULTS
We included 30 patients in our analysis (10 anterior, 10 posterior, and 10 lateral).
The groups were similar with respect to age (p = 0.27), body mass index (p = 0.16), and Charlson Comorbidity Index score (p = 0.66).
Temporal parameters were similar among the groups at all time points.
The anterior and posterior groups showed increased external rotation at 6 weeks (p = 0.003) and 12 weeks (p = 0.012) compared with the lateral group.


METHODS
We conducted a review of the literature to better characterize what factors affect the pursuit of a surgical career.
We searched PubMed and EMBASE and performed additional reference checks.

RESULTS
Our search identified 122 full-text, primary articles.


Issue
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex disorder that affects more than 4 million Canadians and costs the Canadian health care system more than $40 billion per year.

Program overview
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) has launched the national Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR), a coalition of federal, provincial, and territorial partners dedicated to integrating research into care.


Results
Wait time to first appointment in 2011 was 225.3 days (95% CI = [211.0, 239.6], N = 364), compared to 93.0 days (95% CI = [89.2, 96.8], N = 838) in 2013 (p<.001).
Depending on the question, 65 to 95% of parents and children gave positive answers about CAPA.


Background
Tourette syndrome (TS) is often co-morbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Studies of TS, anxiety and depression have found variable results depending on study methodology and sample characteristics.
Our aim was to examine the clinical utility of routine screening for anxiety and depression in children with TS.

Results
One hundred twenty six children were included (mean age 10.7 years).
The most common comorbid disorder was ADHD (37%), followed by GAD (21%), OCD (10%), MDD (2%) and SAD (2%).
On the MASC, the separation anxiety/panic subscale score was higher than all other subscale scores (p<0.0001).
Clinically significant anxiety symptoms were present in 20% of the sample based on the MASC Anxiety Disorders Index, while 6% were identified as potentially clinically depressed based on the CDI Total Score.
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale scores were positively correlated with total scores on the MASC (r=0.22, p=0.03) and CDI (r=0.37, p=0.0002).


Results
Of the 121 youth who agreed to be contacted after discharge, 62 youth completed the post-discharge survey.
Almost half (n=29) of the youth reported that they had considerable difficulty with school reintegration.
Youth reported managing social situations, academic pressures and emotions as substantial problems.
There were no differences between the two groups on school-related variables.


Results
Of 624 assessments 24% (N=151) were repeat-presentations.

Conclusion
Repeat-presentations for urgent psychiatric consultation constitute a quarter of referrals to the urgent psychiatric clinic.
In turn, this will improve access to the limited urgent services for other youth.


Results
FBT-TAY is an acceptable and feasible treatment to all study therapists as evidenced by their fidelity to the model.

Conclusions
FBT-TAY, the first manualized AN treatment for TAY, demonstrated feasibility and acceptability with therapists and participants as well as improvement for participants in EDE-Q global score and weight.
Given the current dearth of effective treatments for TAY with AN, FBT-TAY is a promising adaptation of FBT.
A larger clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up is recommended.


Results
Initial stimulant discontinuation was a function of adverse effects and/or limited symptom improvement.
Minimal response and/or adverse effects to non-stimulants contributed to the decision to retry stimulants.
Final ADHD symptom ratings by parents and teachers were significantly better than baseline for this cohort.
Three were discharged on stimulants, two as monotherapy.

Conclusion
Retrying a stimulant may be one option.


Results
The mean age was 14.5 years and most participants were female (70.2%).
ANOVAs comparing self-concept with population norms showed large significant effects (d = 0.77 to 1.93) indicating compromised self-concept among youth receiving mental health services.


METHODS
Our analyses are based on hospital discharge abstract data linked to vital statistics and to patient registry data.
We considered all first known admissions for THA in New Brunswick between Jan. 1, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2013.
Provider volume was defined as total THAs performed over the preceding 2 years.

RESULTS
About 7095 patients were admitted for THA in New Brunswick over the 7-year study period and 170 died within 30 days.
We found no associations with provider volume and postoperative mortality in any of our models.
Adjustment for contextual characteristics or hospital volume had no effects on this association.


Results
The mean age was 14.5 years and most participants were female (70.2%).
ANOVAs comparing self-concept with population norms showed large significant effects (d = 0.77 to 1.93) indicating compromised self-concept among youth receiving mental health services.


Results
This level of accuracy was found to be superior to the clinical prediction determined by the Thakar score.


Results
A traditional consult visit was avoided in 45% of cases based on the specialist's advice; 21% cases required referral.


Methods
We calculated the capacity cost per minute for each resource used.

Findings
Between March 2014 and June 2015, the project tracked the clinical services for 7162 outpatients.
The cost of care for specific conditions varied widely across the five facilities, due to heterogeneity in staffing and resources.
For example, the average cost of a first antenatal-care visit ranged from 6.87 United States dollars (US$) at a low-level facility to US$ 25.06 at a high-level facility.


Findings
Overall, vaccination teams administered 424 100 doses of vaccine to an estimated target population of 578 043, resulting in an estimated administrative coverage of 73.4%.
After the campaign, few cholera cases were reported and there was no evidence of the disease spreading within the vaccinated areas.
The total cost of the campaign - 2.31 United States dollars (US$) per dose - included the relatively low cost of local delivery - US$ 0.41 per dose.


Methods
In a single province, we surveyed eight farms in which chickens were raised for meat and interviewed the farms' owners in 2016.

Findings
No use of antibiotics for growth promotion was reported.
The total amount of antibiotic used on all Thai chickens raised for meat in 2016 was estimated to be 161 tonnes.


Findings
In 2016-2017, licensed antibiotic distribution in Thailand involves over 700 importers and about 24 000 distributors - e.g. retail pharmacies and wholesalers.
Thailand imports antibiotics and active pharmaceutical ingredients.
There is no system for monitoring the distribution of active ingredients, some of which are used directly on farms, without being processed.
Most antibiotics can be bought from pharmacies, for home or farm use, without a prescription.
Pharmacists working in pharmacies are covered by some of the Act's regulations, but the quality of their dispensing and prescribing appears to be largely reliant on their competences.

Conclusion
In Thailand, most antibiotics are easily and widely available from retail pharmacies, without a prescription.


Case presentation
Here we report the case of a 25-year-old man who underwent onco-TESE from his residual single testis with a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor that occurred 5 years after orchiectomy of the contralateral testis.
A second orchiectomy and simultaneous TESE from the noncancerous testicular tissue were performed.
The pathological diagnosis was germ cell tumors, tumors of more than one histological type (embryonal carcinoma, immature teratoma, yolk sac tumor, seminoma, and choriocarcinoma; pT1N0M0).


Results
505 CCA members completed the survey (7.0% completed response rate, 65% males, 19% with graduate degrees).
Researchers (26 full-time and 67 part-time) produced over 530 authorships in the past five years.
Clinical research and systematic reviews were the most common areas of involvement.
Regular meetings were rarely reported between researchers and chiropractic stakeholder organizations.
Stakeholders indicated using research for member education, negotiation with government or funders, direct inquiries, and increased credibility.
Fewer than half of the organizations regularly evaluated their research needs.


Background
The association between physical inactivity and non-communicable disease risk has been well documented in recent literature.


Results
A few knowledge gaps were identified in the sample population.


Introduction
Osteochondral lesions of the tibial plafond account for approximately 2.6% of osteochondral lesions in the ankle.

Case Presentation
Radiographs were negative for fracture or osteochondral involvement.


Conclusion
Further evaluation of the efficacy is warranted.


RESULTS
A total of 73 articles reporting on 71 surveys met the inclusion criteria.


RESULTS
Using a lower cut-off point of 21, the sensitivity for individuals under 40 improved to 77% with a specificity of 44%.
Though specificity at this threshold was low, the higher level of sensitivity reflects the importance of the identification of high risk individuals in this population.


Background
In recent years, the combination of high-throughput genetic approaches and technological advances has identified important regulators contributing to GN.


Background
Follicle stimulating hormone and testosterone stimulate Sertoli cells to support germ cell function and differentiation.
During mini-puberty, when gonadotropin (GnRH) stimulates increases in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels, gonocytes are transformed into Ad spermatogonia.
Treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa/Buserelin) induced gonocytes to differentiate into Ad spermatogonia and rescued fertility.
Furthermore, we analyzed changes in the transcription of selected Sertoli cell specific genes in response to GnRHa treatment.

Conclusions
We propose that gonadotropin-dependent increases in FASLG and GDNF expression drove Sertoli cell proliferation and germ cell self-renewal and supported the transition of gonocytes to Ad spermatogonia, independent of inhibins.


Results
High-dose steroids were used by most of the respondents to treat clinical and subclinical Banff grade 1A and 1B rejections.


Objective
There are no evidence-based guidelines for their management.


Conclusions
However, this did not appear to translate into greater awareness or use of the guidelines.
Continued tool/resource development and training initiatives may be required.


Results
There was no significant change in physical activity or HRQOL over time between groups.


INTRODUCTION
Suffering at work among health professionals is a hot topic.
Medical students, doctors of tomorrow, are far from being spared.

CONCLUSION
Studying medicine includes positive and negative aspects.


INTRODUCTION
Over the years, these conditions have been the subject of numerous controversies.


Methods
Three effectiveness end points were analyzed: closure after one course of treatment, repeat medical treatment, and surgical ligation.

Results
A total of 179 infants were included.
After adjustment for gestational age, the association between ibuprofen arginine and increased use of a repeat course of treatment remained significant.
The groups did not differ with respect to adverse effects.


Results
The search identified 560 unique citations, of which 7 articles met the inclusion criteria.
One additional article identified by an expert in the field was also included.
Four of the identified papers were limited to penicillin or other β-lactam allergies.
Six studies noted differences in antibiotic selection between patients with allergy labels and those without such labels.
Broader-spectrum or second-line agents (e.g., vancomycin, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones) were more commonly prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy labels.
Antibiotic therapy costs were significantly higher for patients with allergy labels than for those without.
The impact of allergy labels on clinical outcomes was mixed.
One study indicated a longer length of hospital stay, 2 studies reported higher readmission rates, and 1 study reported a higher rate of antibiotic-resistant organisms for patients with allergy labels.

Conclusions
Most of the available literature is limited to penicillin or β-lactam allergy.


Methods
We describe the government's referral and treatment guidelines in response to the outbreak.

Findings
In February 2016, we noticed a steep increase in the numbers of oral opium users referred to our poison treatment centre with abdominal pain, anaemia and constipation.
Over 7 months, 4294 poison cases were seen at main referral hospitals in Tehran out of an estimated 31 914 oral opium users in the city.


Methods
We made a descriptive analysis with a focus on policy gaps and deviations from WHO policy recommendations.

Findings
We obtained documents from 68 of 113 low-burden countries and 30 of 35 countries with the highest burdens of tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis.
In most high-burden countries the recommendation was symptom screening alone before treatment, whereas in all low-burden countries it was testing before treatment.


Methods
It was a cross-sectional study involving the analysis of EEGs of consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of idiopathic GE from three centers over a 7-year period.
Information on sociodemographic and seizure variables was obtained.
The International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology definition of interictal epileptiform discharges (interictal epileptiform activity [IEA]) was adopted in the study.

Results
Their age ranged between 2 weeks and 70 years, with a median age of 21 years and an interquartile age of 26 years.
Two hundred and thirty-seven (58.8%) and 213 (52.9%) patients had abnormal EEG and IEA, respectively.


RESULTS
The ASIRs of childhood cancer among males increased by 0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.2-0.9) annually from 1992 to 2010, whereas incidence among females increased by 3.2% (CI = 0.4-6.2) annually since 2004 after an initial stabilization.
The largest overall increase was observed in children aged 1-4 years (APC = 0.9%, CI = 0.4-1.3).
By region, the overall rates increased the most in Ontario from 2006 to 2010 (APC = 5.9%, CI = 1.9-10.1), and increased non-significantly in the other regions from 1992 to 2010.
Average annual ASIRs for all cancers combined from 2006 to 2010 were lower in the Prairies (149.4 per million) and higher in Ontario (170.1 per million).
The ASIRs increased for leukemias, melanoma, carcinoma, thyroid cancer, ependymomas and hepatoblastoma for all ages, and neuroblastoma in 1-4 year olds.
Astrocytoma decreased in 10-14 year olds (APC = -2.1%, CI = -3.7 to -0.5), and among males (APC = -2.4%, CI = -4.6 to -0.2) and females (APC = -3.7%, CI = -5.8 to -1.6) in Ontario over the study period.


RESULTS
The mean (standard deviation) C-HEI score in this sample of 446 adults aged 20 to 83 was 64.4 (10.8).


CONCLUSION
TBIs are an important and growing health concern in Canada.


CONCLUSION
A more complete understanding of clinical workload expectations may promote recruitment of resident physicians.


INTRODUCTION
Vitamin D deficiency is widespread throughout the world.
Vitamin D has an important role in the regulation of phosphocalcic metabolism as well as in a large number of biological and metabolic processes.
According to some studies, there is a correlation between vitamin D and LDL-cholesterol levels.


CONCLUSIONS
Such surveys are also not well suited to measuring combinations of methods and mosaics of method combinations.


METHODS
Our analyses are based on hospital discharge abstract data linked to vital statistics and to patient registry data.
We considered all first known admissions for THA in New Brunswick between Jan. 1, 2007, and Dec. 31, 2013.
Provider volume was defined as total THAs performed over the preceding 2 years.

RESULTS
About 7095 patients were admitted for THA in New Brunswick over the 7-year study period and 170 died within 30 days.
We found no associations with provider volume and postoperative mortality in any of our models.
Adjustment for contextual characteristics or hospital volume had no effects on this association.


RESULTS
A total of 3042 patients underwent SAVR or TAVI during the study period, 1491 in Nova Scotia, 1042 in New Brunswick and 509 in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Patient demographic characteristics were similar across regions.


RESULTS
Ninety-six patients were included in the study, 41 in the cell saver group and 55 in the control group.
Of the 96, 64 (67%) could be matched, 32 in either group.
The 2 groups were balanced for demographic and clinical variables.
The allogenic blood transfusion rate was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5%-43.7%) in the cell saver group versus 72% (95% CI 56.3%-87.5%) in the control group (p < 0.001).
The overall and infectious complication rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups.


METHODS
Two-hour training included a didactic session, live demonstration, small-group practice and debriefing.

RESULTS
Eighteen (50%) of 36 invited residents participated.
Most residents (83%) felt that a new communication tool would be useful.
Almost all (94%) used BC/WC in practice.
Residents found the tool acceptable and useful to enhance preference-sensitive communications.
Barriers to BC/WC use included time constraints and difficulty defining the best and worst cases precisely.
Summative attitudes and confidence scores were not different before and after the intervention; however, actions scores were higher after the intervention (p = 0.04).
Residents performed a median of 15 (interquartile range 13-17) of the 19 elements on the formative performance evaluation.
Commonly missed items were narrating outcomes of palliative approaches, prompting deliberation and providing treatment recommendations.


RESULTS
Eighty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria.
The incidence of ELTIs increased over time, paralleling a rise in detection during the period incorporating greater computed tomography (CT) use (p = 0.002).
The largest contributors to increased endotracheal tube placements were the emergency department and emergency medical services.


METHODS
We used several checklists to measure the quality of the studies.
We also collected data on costing.

RESULTS
The literature search identified 924 publications, of which 38 were retained for analysis: 15 literature reviews, 1 good-practice guideline and 22 new primary studies.
The overall level of evidence was low to moderate owing to the limited sample sizes, lack of information on patient characteristics and lack of standardization of the outcome measures.
However, the results obtained are consistent from study to study.
In the short and medium term, RFA is considered as effective as open surgery or laser treatment (moderate level of evidence) and presents fewer major and minor complications than open surgery (low level of evidence).
Radiofrequency ablation can be performed on an outpatient basis.
We calculated that RFA would be about $110-$220 more expensive per patient than open surgery.


Results
A total of 28 patients were included in the study.


Results
The study involved 449 axillae.
Only 4 (2.55%) cases encountered a small area of skin necrosis, and 28 (17.83%) had local damage to the epidermis.


Results
A total of 152 patients underwent 154 total or modified radical mastectomies.
We obtained a rate of PMBR of 21%, 14% immediate reconstruction, and 8% delayed.

Conclusions
Our Canadian tertiary care institution has a high volume of breast surgery and an active breast reconstruction team.
However, the rate of immediate reconstruction remains low compared to similar centers in the United States.
Level of Evidence Epidemiologic study, Level III.


Results
RRAC patients had shorter hospital stays (0.38 RRAC nights, 1.45 RHAC nights, p<0.001).


Results
Over a 6-month trial period, 15 plastic surgeons and residents used the application to photograph 86 patients.
Over half of the patients (57%) completed the survey.
The majority of patients (96%) were satisfied with the application's consent process, and all felt their photographs were secure.
The majority (93%) of surgeons/residents completed the survey.
The application was felt to overcome issues with current photography practices: inadequate consent and storage of photographs (100%), risk to patient confidentiality (92%), and unsecure photograph sharing (93%).
Barriers to regular use of the application included need for cellphone service/Internet (54%), sanitary concerns due to the need for patients to sign directly on the phone (46%), inability to obtain proactive/retroactive consent (85%), and difficulty viewing photographs (80%).


Results
Half of them required hand therapy.
Eight of the 12 patients had good documentation of a full return of hand function.


Results
Of 701 titles identified by the search strategy, 36 met the inclusion criteria.
However, up to 84% of patients do not disclose the use of CAM to their allopathic practitioners.


Results
Over 80% of the surgeons were male.


Results
Eighty (53%) residents and 10 (77%) program directors responded.
The majority want the option of working post-call (63%) and oppose an 80-hour weekly maximum (77%).
Surgical and medical errors attributed to post-call fatigue were self-reported by 26% and 49% of residents, respectively.

Conclusions
The majority of respondents oppose duty hour restrictions.


Results
The MFS was continuous with the GFS.

Results
The thumb was the most frequent digit to resolve without treatment (72%).


Results
Of 2217 kidney transplant recipients, 37 (1.7%) developed PTLD.


Results
Almost half (47.9%) of the current waterpipe smokers used multiple tobacco products; 93.4% were dual users and 6.6% poly-users.
The other tobacco products used were cigarettes (86.4%), electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (7.0%) or both (6.6%).
Multiple users were more likely to be younger than waterpipe-only users.
Young adult female waterpipe smokers used ENDS 12 times more than young adult males (48.8% versus 4.1% respectively).


Background
Hypertension is the most important cardiovascular risk factor in the World Health Organization (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region.
Excessive salt and sodium intake is directly related to hypertension, and its reduction is a priority of WHO.

Results
The mean salt content of breads varied from 4.28 g/kg in Jordan to 12.41 g/kg in Tunisia.
The mean salt and sodium content in bread for all countries was 7.63 (SD 3.12) and 3.0 (SD 1.23) g/kg, respectively.


Background
Optimal breastfeeding practices and appropriate complementary feeding improve child health, survival and development.

Results
Seventeen countries in the Region have enacted legislation to protect breastfeeding.


Methods
Data were analysed monthly from 2008 to 2013.

Results
Market availability of 13 of 26 drugs was significantly reduced.


Methods
A checklist was developed and scores assigned based on the MPOWER indicators (maximum score 37).
MPOWER data for the Region in the 2015 and 2017 tobacco control reports were extracted and scored.
Data from similar analyses for 2011 and 2013 were also included.
Countries were ranked by scores for each indicator for 2015 and 2017 and for overall scores for 2011 to 2017.

Results
The Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt and Pakistan had the highest scores in 2015 (33, 29 and 27 respectively) and the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan and Yemen had the highest scores in 2017 (34, 31 and 27 respectively).
The indicators with the highest and lowest combined score for all countries were for advertising bans and compliance with smoke-free policies: 67 and 18 respectively in 2015, and 73 and 15 respectively in 2017.
Most countries (15/22) had higher total scores in 2017 than 2015: Afghanistan, Bahrain and Syrian Arab Republic had the greatest increases.
The total score for the Region increased from 416 out of a maximum score of 814 in 2011 to 471 in 2017.


Introduction
The need for child/adolescent mental health care in Canada is growing.

Results
Sixteen articles were identified that met inclusion criteria.


Results
Mean age of subjects (n=99, 79 females and 20 males) was 15.24 years (SD = 1.30).
Most common reasons for admission were suicidal gestures/self harm (n=57, 58%) and mood disorders (n=53, 54%).
Thirty-seven patients (37%) had sexual health information documented in their charts.

Conclusions
Screening for sexual health concerns is not being documented in the majority of adolescent psychiatry inpatients.
Omitting sexual health screening during hospitalizations represents a missed opportunity for investigation and management of sexual health issues in this high-risk group.


Results
There was no significant difference in children rating of their anxiety within groups from pre- to post-intervention.
Parents were satisfied mostly with the intervention.


Methods
A series of synchronous video-conferencing linkage strategies were attempted to connect a mental health consultation service to multiple schools in a Canadian setting.

Results
Synchronous video conference consultations were successfully delivered to six elementary schools across three school districts.
Two of three linkage strategies were functional.
A second used existing laptops in both the health and school system linked through a communication platform.
A third connection, using 3G/4G hotspots to obviate the need to access school Wi-Fi, was deemed too expensive in this setting.


Methods
All data were analyzed in SPSS v. 20 with multiple regression analysis.


Results
An 11-year-old female with ASD and ADHD referred to our clinic experienced vomiting, headaches, and light sensitivity following abrupt discontinuation of methylphenidate; she subsequently presented with migraines and marked malaise immediately after a dose reduction in lisdexamfetamine.
Evidence supports the notion that ADHD symptoms in children with ASD can be effectively treated with methylphenidate; however, beneficial effects are less robust relative to children with a primary ADHD diagnosis.
Children affected by ASD are also more susceptible to adverse effects.
Literature on withdrawal from stimulants in children is limited to case studies; in contrast, in the adult population more information is available, especially in adults with substance abuse disorders.
Adults experiencing stimulant withdrawal often experience depression, fatigue, changes in appetite, and insomnia or hypersomnia.

Conclusions
Children with ASD are more sensitive to stimulant medications and we wonder whether this extends to an increased sensitivity to developing tolerance to stimulant medication.


Results
During the study period, there were a total of 1199 living donor nephrectomies.
Compared with the reference standard, this algorithm had a sensitivity of 97% and a PPV of 90%.
The diagnostic and procedural codes performed better than the physician billing codes (sensitivity 60%, PPV 78%).


INTRODUCTION
ParticipACTION is a Canadian physical activity communications and social marketing organization relaunched in 2007.


RESULTS
Organizational capacity in terms of partnerships and collaborations, and the general climate for physical activity promotion have improved since ParticipACTION's relaunch.
There were mixed feelings on ParticipACTION's contribution to capacity.


RESULTS
Approximately 20% of Canadians reported unprompted awareness of ParticipACTION and 82% reported prompted awareness.
Education, income, and having children were significant correlates of awareness among Canadians.
Furthermore, awareness of ParticipACTION was positively associated with outcome expectations and self-efficacy, and negatively associated with LTPA status.


Findings
Overall, 51% (142 million) of the study population was exposed to mean annual multicontaminant concentrations above WHO limits - east China and the megacities were worst affected.
Surprisingly, multicontaminant air pollution was less frequent in cities with populations over 10 million than in smaller cities.

Conclusion
Multicontaminant air pollution was common in Chinese cities.


Methods
The study involved 648 consecutive adults treated for tuberculosis at 14 primary health-care facilities.
All were assessed at treatment initiation (i.e. baseline) and after 2 and 6 months.
We defined probable depression as a score of 10 or above on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire.
Data on treatment default, failure and success and on death were obtained from tuberculosis registers.
Quality of life was assessed using a visual analogue scale and we calculated disability scores using the World Health Organization's Disability Assessment Scale.
Using multivariate Poisson regression analysis, we estimated the association between probable depression at baseline and treatment outcomes and death.


Conclusion
Most women used the Malawian programme for the prevention of MTCT.


Relevant changes
The number of districts reporting surveillance data to the health ministry increased to 13 out of 14.
Verifying rumours of disease outbreaks with field-level evidence, and early detection and containment of outbreaks, allowed district health authorities to focus on recovery and reconstruction.


Results
Only 12 articles of 946 were accepted.
The quality of studies was generally good.
In 8 sham controlled studies, a psychologically and physiologically "credible" sham was found in only 2 studies.
A significant difference was noted between SM vs. Sham, and between SM and an inactive control.
No significant difference in PPT was found between SM and another SM, mobilisation or some type of physical therapy.
The cervical region more often obtained significant findings as compared to studies in the thoracic or lumbar regions.

Conclusion
SM has an effect regionally on pressure pain threshold in asymptomatic subjects.
More knowledge is needed in relation to the comparison of different spinal regions and different types of interventions.


INTRODUCTION
The introduction of early cancer detection and the improvement in treatment efficacy have led to a significant increase in the survival and the prevalence of (ex) cancer patients.
Approximately 40 % of new cancer cases are diagnosed every year in the working age population (20-64 years).

CONCLUSIONS
Nevertheless, the structure of the EPS presents many limitations to the interpretation and reliability of results.


INTRODUCTION
Hypercalcemia is a common pathological condition in clinical practice.
The two most common causes are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer.

CONCLUSION
Our study shows that there is an association between the presence of hyponatremia and neoplastic origin of hypercalcemia.
Besides, the association described between hyponatremia and cancer is not faulted by the presence of hypercalcemia, a potential cause of acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.


Objectives
The secondary objective was to identify perceived barriers to conducting research.

Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results.
Groups of survey participants were compared to examine differences in measured outcomes.


Results
The most frequently reported AEFI were BCG adenitis and local reactions - 31.1 and 4.1 per 100 000 doses respectively.
There were no reported deaths.
Pentavalent vaccine was responsible for the greatest proportion of adverse events (30%).
Local reaction was the most common adverse event among all vaccines administered.

Conclusion
The overall rate of AEFI (8.3 per 100 000 doses administered) is comparable to the rate (10.8/100 000 doses) in the previous decade (1996-2005) in Oman.
The reported rates for individual vaccines are similar to or below international rates.


Methods
Within each cluster, 14 households with youth of the appropriate age were sampled.

Results
Almost one quarter of unmarried youth aged 20-24 years reported any sexual experience.
Risk behaviours are higher among males, older youth and in urban areas and refugee camps.


Results
The overall prevalence of tobacco smoking was 24.73% for cigarettes and 30.4% for waterpipe.
Prevalence of cigarette smoking was significantly higher in men, non-health profession students, and in students living away from their families.
War was associated with a significant increase in mean number of cigarettes smoked daily, and 53.1% of smokers reported that the number of cigarettes consumed per day had increased since the beginning of the war.


Methods
Data were collected from May to August 2016.

Results
One hundred and sixty-four (66%) of the infertile couples had moderate to severe depression.


Results
We contacted 575 institutions, of which, 223 (38.8%) responded, indicating that they conducted population research (82%).
Reported studies were mostly in medicine, public health and epidemiology, while reported capacity building mainly focused on scientific writing (20.6%), research proposal writing (18%) and quantitative research methods (17%).
Most institutions reported having collaborating partners (82%) - predominantly national (77%).
Sixty-four percent of institutions received their own funding, with 48% reporting always having access to national databases.


Results
Our search retrieved 44 relevant studies.
Efforts to control tobacco smoking are available, but inadequate.

Conclusions
Tobacco smoking is a prevalent health problem in Egypt, associated with cardiovascular disorders and malignant tumors.


Results
Alternate segregation mode is predominant in our group of Robertsonian translocation carriers with 73.45% ±8.05 of balanced spermatozoa (min 50.92%; max 89.99%).

Despite legal protections for young workers in Canada, youth aged 15-24 are at high risk of traumatic occupational injury.

RESULTS
Half were educational in nature (N=11).
One study outlined a method for developing metrics to predict injury rates.


RESULTS
were similar for Anglophones in rural and materially deprived areas.
The trends persisted over time, but were stronger for women < 30 years.
There were no differences between advantaged Anglophones and Francophones.


Presenting concerns
The initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19, bicarbonate of 13 mEq/L, and a CO2 of 35 mm Hg.
On arrival, her vital signs were within normal limits.
Examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Renin aldosterone ratio was normal.


Results
The cohort included 128 patients, 37.5% of whom were women.
In addition, 63.4% of patients had a serum phosphate of <1.5 mmol/L, and 90.9% of patients had total serum calcium <2.5 mmol/L.


RESULTS
The ACS team was involved in the care of 359 patients, 176 (49.0%) of whom were admitted under the direct care of the ACS team.
Nonoperative care was indicated in 82 patients (46.6%) admitted to the ACS service and 151 (82.5%) of those admitted to a non-ACS service (p < 0.001).
Bowel obstruction (37 patients [21.0%]) was the most common reason for admission, followed by wound/abscess (24 [13.6%), biliary disease (24 [13.6%]) and appendiceal disease (23 [13.1%]).
Rates of 30-day return to the emergency department and readmission were 17.0% and 9.1%, respectively, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.7%.


RESULTS
Twelve sites reported resident coverage.
Most services did not include trauma.
Ten sites had protected operating room time.
Overall, 393 patient encounters occurred during the study period (195/386 [50.5%] operative and 191/386 [49.5%] nonoperative), with a mean of 3.8 operations per service.
The patient population was complex, with 136 patients (34.6%) having more than 3 comorbidities.


RESULTS
We enrolled 133 patients (94 men [70.7%] and 39 women [29.3%] with a mean age of 65.3 years).
The most common index admission diagnosis was peripheral artery disease (67 patients [50.4%]).
At 30 days, 19 patients (14.8%) had been readmitted or had visited the emergency department, most commonly after lower extremity revascularization (19.4%).
Ten patients were readmitted a mean of 16.8 days following discharge; surgical site infection was the most common cause for readmission (3 patients).
The most common treatment was antimicrobial therapy (4 patients).
The mean hospital length of stay was 14.4 days.
Nine patients presented to the emergency department a mean of 10.6 days after discharge; 6 reported a wound issue, and most (6 of 9) were managed with oral antibiotic treatment.


METHODS
We used the Charlson Comorbidity Index as a surrogate measure of comorbidities.
We used hospital and physician billings data and Nova Scotia Vital Statistics data to identify the postoperative events in this cohort.

RESULTS
A total of 10 123 primary THA and 17 243 primary TKA procedures were performed during the study period.
The mean patient age was 66.1 (standard deviation 11.7) years and 67.1 (standard deviation 9.3) years, respectively.
Significant risk factors for death included metastatic disease, older age, heart failure, myocardial infarction, dementia, rheumatologic disease, renal disease, blood transfusion and cancer.
Multiple medical comorbidities and older age were associated with higher rates of blood transfusion and longer hospital stay.


METHODS
This was a 2-phase retrospective matched-pair study of patients who underwent THA in 2007-2013.
All procedures were performed by surgeons with at least 10 years' experience as senior consultant.
The primary outcome measures were percent maximum decrease in hemoglobin level and estimated blood loss after surgery.

RESULTS
In the first phase, patients who received tranexamic acid conserved postoperative hemoglobin by a mean of 10.26 g/L (standard deviation [SD] 9.89 g/L) compared to the control group (p < 0.001).


RESULTS
The data were based on 6021 patients (48% men, mean age 65 [standard deviation 12] yr).
The 30-day mortality rate for MINS was 9.6%.


RESULTS
A total of 140 patients underwent PC tube insertion, 76 men and 64 women with a mean age of 68.4 (standard deviation 17.7) years.
Of the 140, 94 (67.1%) had an American Society of Anesthesiologists classification score of III or IV.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tubes remained in place for a median of 21.0 days, and the median hospital stay was 7.0 days.


RESULTS
For true gallbladder polyps, transabdominal ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 96.3%, positive predictive value of 14.9% (7.0% for malignant polyps) and negative predictive value of 99.7%.

001).


Results
Survey response rate was 88%.
All responding schools offered a clerkship rotation of varying length in time (1-4 weeks).
Students had the most exposure to breast surgery (100%) and general plastic surgery (100%) and the least exposure to aesthetic surgery (40%).


Results
Seven studies were included in the final analysis: 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) and 6 non-randomized studies.
The mean follow-up ranged from 14 to 72 months.
The rate of CC was less than 2% in 8 studies, between 3% and 6% in 4 studies, and 13.9% in 1 study.
Included studies demonstrated significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity.
The solitary low-quality RCT concluded that antibiotic irrigation was superior to saline irrigation.
Three non-randomized studies demonstrated no significant difference in the rate of CC with the use of antibiotics.
One non-randomized controlled study showed that the use of mixture of antibiotic and povidone-iodine significantly lowered the rate of CC.


Results
In most cases (97.6%), the index FDP was innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN).
In most cases (85.4%), the ring FDP was innervated by the UN only.
In majority of cases (64.6%), the little FDP was innervated by the UN only.


Results
Twenty-two articles reporting 651 patients who underwent mastectomies and breast-conserving surgeries were included in this review.
Most flaps, 537 (82.5%), were harvested by laparoscopy, and 626 (96.2%) of the flaps were pedicle flaps.
The mean age was 47.7 years (standard deviation: 4.29), and mean follow-up was 38.1 months.
There were 88 reported complications among 562 patients in 16 reports.
The rate of any complication was calculated to be 15.0%, with a higher rate (29.1%) occurring with the open technique in comparison to laparoscopy (12.6%).
The commonest complications were postoperative infection and breast firmness each reported in 2.22%.
Most authors reported advantages of malleability and excellent aesthetic outcomes and disadvantages in terms of inability to estimate the volume of the flap and variability in size.


INTRODUCTION
We studied the characteristics of these patients immediately before and after the introduction of the percutaneous technique in the CHU Brugmann.


INTRODUCTION
An IgM monoclonal gammopathy points to a diagnosis of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.
The discovery of the L265P mutation of the MYD88 gene simplified potentially the situation.

CONCLUSION
A precise diagnosis requires collating clinical, histological, immunophenotypical and genetical data.


INTRODUCTION
Despite it affects a large proportion of the population, they are few therapeutic options often restrictive.
The injection of PRP in alopecic areas is a new and easy therapeutic option.


Methods
We used Poisson interrupted time series, statistical modelling and graphical analyses.


Methods
Using mortality data from the Chinese national disease surveillance points system, we examined trends in poisoning mortality by intent and substance from 2006 to 2016.

Results
In 2016, there were 4936 poisoning deaths in a sample of 84 060 559 people (5.9 per 100 000 people; 95% confidence interval: 5.6-6.2).
Age-adjusted poisoning mortality dropped from 9.2 to 5.4 per 100 000 people between 2006 and 2016.
Males, rural residents and older adults consistently had higher poisoning mortality than females, urban residents and children or young adults.


Findings
These volunteers provided 790 individual responses to 759 requests for information addressing unverified health threats in 112 countries; 361 (45%) responses were considered to be useful.
Most responses were received within hours of the requests.
The responses led to 194 ProMED posts, of which 99 (51%) supported verification of an outbreak, were published on ProMED and sent to over 87 000 subscribers.


Findings
We included a representative sample of 18 369 patients.

Conclusion
These findings highlight the public health relevance of including the new diagnostic category in the ICD-11.


Methods
Using a global ecological model of dengue virus transmission, we predicted the suitability of cities in non-endemic areas for yellow fever transmission.

Local setting
A rabies-endemic region, KwaZulu-Natal is one of the smallest and most populous South African provinces (estimated population 10 900 000).


Results
Of the 82 patients previously studied, 64 (78%) patients participated in the follow-up study (mean age 70.5 ± 4.4 years, 58% male, 55% diabetic).
Among those completing functional status measures, 32 (50%) had functional disability at baseline.
Eleven patients (17%) initially independent, developed new-onset disability.


Diagnoses
Skin biopsy revealed IgA leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
Serum cryoglobulins were positive and there was hypocomplementemia with a low C3 level.

Lessons learned
This case shows that SAGN can closely mimic the clinical, laboratory, and histological presentation of Henoch-Schönlein Purpura or cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.


Results
There were 314 patients enrolled and 79.9% completed 12 month follow-up.
Ninety-four (29.9%) patients received at least 1 unit of blood.
During the first 90 days, the transfusion episode rate was 148.4 per 100 patient-years compared with 62.6 per 100 patient-years post 90 days.
Some patients had >1 indication.
Cox regression analysis on time to first transfusion and time to first hospitalization/death both showed an association with inpatient initiation of HD.


Measurements
Dialysis modality was treated as a time-varying covariate.

Results
Beyond 7 days, the risk did not differ significantly by dialysis modality.
Female sex and Indigenous race were significant risk factors for all-cause hospitalization.


Methods
We revised Burkina Faso's latent tuberculosis infection register and quarterly tuberculosis reporting form.

Findings
The overall contact:index ratio was 0.31 and corresponding screening coverage was 82.0% (956/1166) and proportion of children starting on preventive treatment was 90.5% (852/941).
Active tracing in Hauts-Bassins led to a substantially higher contact/index ratio (1.83) and screening coverage (99.3%; 145/146).


Methods
We searched PubMed®, Embase® and LILACS online databases from inception to 26 January 2018.
We excluded studies in which having symptoms of Zika virus was a criterion for inclusion.
The main outcome assessed was percentage of all Zika virus-positive participants who were asymptomatic.
We used a quality-effects approach and the double arcsine transformation for the meta-analysis.

Findings
We assessed 753 studies for inclusion, of which 23 were included in the meta-analysis, totalling 11 305 Zika virus-positive participants.
Funnel and Doi plots showed major asymmetry, suggesting selection bias or true heterogeneity.


Relevant changes
The forum hosted three research symposia and two national injury forums.

Lessons learnt
Integration of training components within existing academic structures is key to sustainability.


Approach

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015.

Results
The mean age was 30 years, 181 were married, 179 were illiterate and 287 had income < 5000 rupees per month.
Only 63 patients were adherent to ART and 343 were alcoholics.


Background
There is lack of studies examining the role of anthropometric indices in people with dysglycaemia.

Methods

Background
Tobacco smoking kills more than 5 million people annually and it is the most important cause of preventable death.
Waterpipe smoking is common in the Middle East and is prevalent among young people.
There is a misconception that it is less harmful than cigarette smoking.
Physicians are considered role models in the community and their behaviours and attitudes towards smoking can have direct effects on cessation.


Methods
We also collected demographic, socioeconomic, residential and behavioural data.

Results
In the previous 30 days, 505 (8.9%) participants had smoked cigarettes, 355 (6.3%) had smoked midwakh, 421 (7.4%) had smoked shisha and 380 (6.4%) had smoked any other form of tobacco.
Overall, 818 (14.0%) adolescents were current smokers, who reported occasional or daily use of at least one form of tobacco in the past 30 days.
consistently indicated that the prevalence of tobacco use was higher among men than women, regardless of age and tobacco form.
Among men, cigarette smoking was the most popular, whereas shisha was the most smoked form of tobacco among women.
Being male and ever having used illegal drugs consistently emerged as significant predictors of all forms of tobacco use.


Methods
A total of 18 quantitative and qualitative studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria were selected to be included in the review.

Conclusion
The organizational culture is strongly implicated in inhibiting empathy.


RESULTS
Current evidence suggests regional age and sex differences with respect to health outcomes, especially when synthetic opioids are involved.
However, differences between data collection methods and reporting requirements may impact the interpretation and comparability of reported data.

The prevalence of major depressive episodes was 50.5% with an estimated 38.5% suicide risk.
23% had antisocial personality and 11% of respondents displayed a psychotic syndrome.
Illicit drugs were found in 14% of prisoners and abuse of these drugs was reported by 17% of them.
8% had a state of post-traumatic stress and 3.5% obsessive compulsive disorder.


RESULTS
Our study concerned 275 patients including 61.41% women with a sex-ratio (M/W) of 0.62.

The initial average weight of our patients was 59.88 kg [range: 30-107] with the majority (66.91%) at the stage III of the WHO clinical classification.
The serologic profile was dominated by HIV1 (97.09%) with a number of average CD4 of 210.99 cells/mm3 at the initiation of the ARV treatment.
The evolution under treatment was marked clinically by an average ponderal gain of 7,45kg, with weight increasing from 59.88 kg to 67.33 kg between M0 and M54.
Biologically, the number of average CD4 increased from 210.99 to 643 between M0 and M48 with an average gain of 432.01 cells/mm3.
On the virological level, the plasmatic viral load was carried out for 64 patients out of 275.


RESULTS
With a total of 300 subjects with high blood pressure, 42 subjects presented an orthostatic LBP with or without suggestive clinical demonstrations, among which 16 men and 26 women, with an average age of 55 year.
In the HBP population, the orthostatic LBP had a 14% frequency (42/300), the sex ratio was 0.61.
Most of the patients were 55 years old or more.
The HBP was not controlled in 66.7% of cases.
Twelve percent of the patients with orthostatic LBP were diabetics.
The number of antihypertensive drug used did not appear to influence the appearance of an orthostatic LBP.
It must be systematically looked for, especially in the uncontrolled HBP, among older subjects, the diabetics, and those with a personal history of neurological disease.


RESULTS
A total of 256 patients were included, 67 (26.1%) were HIV +.
A minority, 25% of co-infected HIV / PTB, had TB bacilli high density (+++) versus 45% of mono-infected (P = 0.005).
The smear conversion was obtained in 96% of coinfected versus 93% in HIV- at the end of the intensive phase (P = 0.5).
The cure rate was 86% and 93.1% respectively in co-infected and HIV-.
A proportion of 13.5% of co-infected died versus 3% in HIV- (P = 0.005).
21% of co-infected with CD4 <200 died versus 3.6% of those with CD4> 200 (P = 0.041).

CONCLUSION
This work underlines the high prevalence of HIV / TB co-infection in this region.

The viral plasmatic load of the HIV-1 was undetectable with a rate of TCD4+ < 100 cells /µl in 12 months.
Factors associated with IVDR were the age between 35 and 45 years (p = 0.0009), the number of +CD4 T cells (+CD4T≤50) at initiation of ARVT (p = 0.00045 ) and the WHO classification clinical stage 3.


RESULTS
The sex ratio was 1.16: 1.
The majority of our patients were from a low socio-economic background.

CONCLUSION
The emphasis must be placed on early treatment and especially the communication for the change of behavior aiming at an early screening of the HIV.
This would allow to reduce effectively the AIDS-related lethality to internal medicine.


RESULTS
the urological emergencies accounted for forty cases which represented 2.57% of pediatric surgery emergencies.
The average age of our patients was 4.5 years with extremes of 10 days and 15 years of age.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
This was a prospective study involved 21 patients (14 women and 7 men) operated for idiopathic megaesophagus during a period of 3 years.
All the patients were operated by thoracotomy procedure.
An anti-reflux system was performed using a diaphragmatic flap over the entire length of the myotomy.

RESULTS
The mean age was 32 years (range 16 and 68 years).
After the surgery we have seen a complete disappearance of dysphagia in 21 patients (100 %) (p <0.001) and a significant weight regain.
Short term outcomes were marked by the occurrence of clinical gastroesophageal reflux disease in 1 patient (4.76%) who has received the anti-reflux system (p> 0.05).

Fifty-millilitre aliquots of the suspension were stored in 100-mL bottles (amber PVC, amber glass, or amber PET).

Results
The concentration of domperidone in all study samples remained above 93% of initial concentration after storage for 91 days.


Methods
A before-and-after pilot study was conducted.

Results
Among all patients admitted to participating inpatient rehabilitation units during the 2 study periods, smoking prevalence was 7.8% (127/1626).
After exclusions, deaths, and withdrawals, 111 patients were retained for analysis: 55 in the control group and 56 in the intervention group.
The overall mean age of participants was 64.9 (standard deviation [SD] 14.3) years, with a mean smoking history of 35.0 (SD 24.8) pack-years.
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of baseline characteristics.
Self-reported abstinence rates (determined 3 months after discharge) were higher after compared with before implementation of the OMSC program: for continuous abstinence, 16/56 (28.6%) versus 9/55 (16.4%), χ2 = 4.462, p = 0.035; for 7-day point prevalence abstinence, 21/56 (37.5%) versus 10/55 (18.2%), χ2 = 6.807, p = 0.009.


Methods
All women were cohabiting with a male partner and had a low-risk pregnancy.
Recruitment took place at 20 to 36 weeks' gestation at five primary health centres in Bobo-Dioulasso.
The intervention comprised three educational sessions: (i) an interactive group session during pregnancy with male partners only, to discuss their role; (ii) a counselling session during pregnancy for individual couples; and (iii) a postnatal couple counselling session.
The control group received routine care only.
We followed up participants at 3 and 8 months postpartum.

Findings
The follow-up rate was over 96% at both times.
In the intervention arm, 74% (432/583) of couples or men attended at least two study sessions.


Methods
Through a consultative process, the health ministry estimated the needed and available resources to implement the strategic plan.
The health ministry used the OneHealth Tool to estimate costs of expanding public sector service provision and compared these to estimates of projected available financing.
Cost estimates covered implementation of health programmes including commodities and programme management costs, and six cross-cutting health system strengthening components.
The tool is populated with local demographic, epidemiological, programmatic and unit cost data.
We present costs in constant 2015 United States dollars (US$).

Findings
We estimated the five-year cost of the strategic plan to be US$ 2973.8 million.
Costs are split between health systems strengthening components (US$ 1516.3 million) and investments in individual disease or public health programmes (US$ 1457.5 million).


Methods
Our primary outcome was a positive clinical outcome, defined as treatment success, treatment completion or microbiologic cure.
Using the purchasing power parity conversion factor, we converted the amount of cash received per patient within each study into international dollars (Int$).
We calculated odds ratio (OR) for the primary outcome using a random effects meta-analysis.

Findings
Eight studies met eligibility criteria for review inclusion.
One study assessed a tuberculosis-sensitive intervention, with average amount of Int$ 101.
Four studies included non-cash co-interventions.
All studies showed better primary outcome for the intervention group than the control group.
After excluding three studies with high risk of bias, patients receiving tuberculosis-specific cash transfer were more likely to have a positive clinical outcome than patients in the control groups (OR: 1.77; 95% confidence interval: 1.57-2.01).


Methods
We included studies reporting prevalence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), HBsAg, or both.
We evaluated the quality of the study methods and estimated the relative reduction in the prevalence of infection.

Findings
Of 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, most were from China (20 studies).
The prevalence of HBV infection in unvaccinated and universally vaccinated cohorts ranged from 0.6% (116 of 20 305 people) to 16.3% (60/367) and from 0.3% (1/300) to 8.5% (73/857), respectively.


Results
The proportion of children completely immunized had risen significantly in Punjab but had fallen significantly in Balochistan.
Complete coverage ranged from 16.4% in Balochistan to 65.8% in Punjab (2012-13).
Tetanus toxoid injection during pregnancy was a significant predictor of complete immunization everywhere.


Methods
Data on the education levels of patients and their caregivers were collected, and patient outcomes in high education level (HEL) and low education level (LEL) groups were compared.

Results
Of 167 patients, 101 completed 12 months of follow-up.
The mean age was 58 (13.4) years and 80% were men; 87% were Saudi nationals.
The HEL group comprised 42 (42%) patients.


Methods
This was a cross-sectional, pathology-based study of all new female patients with breast cancer registered in the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2011 (n=10 233).
Initially, crude incidence rates were calculated for each province and the whole country per 100 000 person-years.
Then, a direct standardization method and World Health Organization standard population were used to adjust for age effects on a geographical scale.
Stata and Arc GIS software were used to calculate incidence rates and conduct spatial analysis.

Results
The mean (standard deviation) age of the patients was 50.9 (12.6) years.
The clustering incidence pattern was observed in Mazandaran, Tehran, Alborz, Isfahan and Markazi Provinces (P < 0.01).
There was a significant cluster of high incidence of breast cancer in Iranian women.


Background
Recently the prevalence of traditional methods has increased in Jordan, which may lead to undesired pregnancy.

Methods
A secondary data analysis of the Jordan 2012 Population and Family Health Survey data was carried out.
The survey used a multistage cluster random sample.
Bivariate analysis was conducted to identify the difference between modern and traditional contraceptive users.
A logistic regression model was used to study significant covariates.


Background
Soft tissue rheumatic disorders (STRDs) are very common and impact enormously general population, working groups and physiotherapist practices.
Shoulder is one of the most frequent sites for STRDs.

Methods
A case-control study was designed based on data from the Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) study conducted in Lebanon in 2009.
These were frequency-matched by age and gender with 208 controls who never experienced any musculoskeletal pain.


Implications
Our review demonstrates that driving safety in this patient population remains poorly understood.


Results
There was limited information on the patient important outcomes.


CONCLUSION
Dissemination of accurate information regarding the availability of clinical and legal abortion is needed.


CONCLUSIONS
Strategies to reach women during antenatal care and the postpartum period after their first birth should be prioritized.


Results
Our analysis was based on the data of 108 patients with prostate cancer who were treated with degarelix.
The overall 5-year survival was statistically superior in the changed (96.6%) group than that in the continued (74.1%) group (p = 0.006).
The 5-year cancer-specific survival was also superior in the changed (100%) group than that in the continued (84.6%) group (p = 0.027).
Lower serum levels of prostate specific antigen and alkaline phosphatase were maintained after changing the therapy from degarelix to a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist.

Conclusions
Degarelix is effective in the treatment of prostate cancer.


Results
We noted significant differences across transplant centers in patient race, cause of end-stage renal disease, body mass index, comorbidities, time on dialysis, and donor type.
Median post-transplant hospital stay ranged from 7 to 9 days at the transplant centers studied (p<0.000 1) and largely decreased over time.
Center volume and provider experience were not independently associated with length of hospital stay.


Background
Thiazide diuretics are commonly prescribed to prevent kidney stones.

Results
A total of 536 of 105 239 patients (0.51%) experienced a kidney stone event.


Results
The lifetime prevalence of SUD was 33% (primarily alcohol and cannabis use disorders).
SUD was significantly associated with greater self-reported impulsivity and parent-report of anger/depression in the adolescent.
In multivariable analyses, SUD was associated with panic disorder and oppositional defiant disorder.

Conclusion
Targeting these clinical characteristics may help guide preventative and treatment strategies for this population.


Results
The most successful strategy for contacting participants was through a local agency and e-mail.
An analysis of the contact data identified participant retention rates as 88%, 86%, and 82% for each successive interview.
This longitudinal retention rate is very high compared with research in other vulnerable populations, suggesting a strong willingness to participate in the Youth Matters in London project.

Conclusions
This research underscores the importance of relationships with community agencies to retain vulnerable youth samples in longitudinal research designs.


Results
The group intervention was associated with improved sleep for parent-reported child sleep and self-reported adolescent sleep, but not for parent-reported adolescent sleep.


Objective
People with mental illness have high rates of physical illness that are not detected and that shorten their lifespan.
Health behaviours are central to physical health, and many children and adolescents with psychiatric illness may be at risk for poor physical health.
The purpose for this study was to explore the self-reported health behaviours and well-being of pediatric psychiatric patients and their association with mental health problems.

Results
Informed consent was provided by 161 patients who completed the survey.


Results
Of 239 adolescents assessed, 65 met inclusion criteria, 38 enrolled in the study, and 32 were retained for analysis.

Conclusion
Preliminary results suggest that olanzapine may help facilitate weight gain in adolescents with AN.
The importance of medical monitoring over the course of treatment is discussed.


Background
Smoking among university students is a social and public health problem worldwide.
There is a high prevalence of smoking in Saudi Arabia.

Results
The psychological effect of smoking, such as releasing psychological pressures, was also correlated with changes in smoking behaviour (AOR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.21-0.47).


Methods
Statistical analysis was performed with the χ2 test and multivariate analysis.


Results
Of the 903 index children, 881 (97.6%) were up to date for all vaccinations by age.
Demographic variables were not related to belief in protection through vaccination or rejection of obligatory vaccines.
Father's education level was independently associated with knowledge about optional childhood vaccines.


Results
A significant difference between groups was also found on the PSS, F(1.13) = 19.63, P < 0.001, η2 p = 0.60.


Title
Population and mortality profile in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 2006-2035.

Results
In 2035, the age group 60 years and over will reach 17.6% of the total population.


Methods
Analysis of the data were conducted for 14 countries completing JEE in the Region.
Mean JEE score for each of the 19 technical areas and for the overall technical areas were calculated.
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done to assess correlations with key health, socio-economic and health system indicators.

Results
Mean JEE scores varied substantially across technical areas.
The cumulative mean JEE (mean of indicator scores related to that technical area) was 3 (range: 1-4).
Antimicrobial resistance, Biosecurity and Biosafety indicators obtained the lowest scores.
JEE scores correlated with most of the key indicators examined.
Countries with better health financing system, health service coverage and health status generally had higher JEE scores.
Adolescent fertility rate, neonatal mortality ratio and net primary school enrollment ratio were primary factors within a country's overall JEE score.


Background
Toxoplasmosis is a great public health concern due to its capacity for prenatal transmission.
Estimation of the pooled prevalence of this infection is necessary for policy-making.

Methods
We searched national and international databases to identify relevant studies.
To enhance the search sensitivity, we evaluated all references and interviewed relevant researchers and research centres.
The final studies for meta-analysis were selected according to the quality assessment as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Because of the heterogeneity of the primary results, random effects models were used to estimate the pooled prevalence of T. gondii.
We included 43 studies with a total sample size of 22 644 in the meta-analysis.


RESULTS
Anatomohistology showed 67.1% of colloid benign tumours, and 8 cases of cancers (6.2% of the cases).
For 86 patients (71.1%) the postoperative follow up was simple.

CONCLUSION
Other options are too expensive or not available.


RESULTS
The 2 groups were compared by anthropometrical and clinical data (age, sex, weight) and ASA.

CONCLUSION
Cost of analgesia actually used is reduced.


CONCLUSION
The mortality of the infection by HIV remains high in spite of the introduction of ARV treatment into our service.
The leading causes of death were opportunist infections.
An early tracking of the infection by HIV and an early and optimal assumption of responsibility of the opportunist infections could contribute to reverse the tendencies in Guinea.


PATIENTS AND METHODS

The causes of ankylosis were dominated by noma and acute facial cellulite (76.5%), followed by facial trauma (23.5%).
Transient facial paralysis, one anterior open bite and a recurrence of ankylosis were the main postoperative complications.

CONCLUSION
The temporomandibular ankylosis is a serious complication in maxillofacial pathology.
Actions for the prevention and for a better curative treatment are recommended.


RESULTS
We collated the data of 17 patients.
Fever was the predominant symptom in 14 patients and headache in 13.
The main clinical signs were hemiparesis (11 patients) and vomiting (8 patients).
The origin of infection was especially posttraumatic in 5 patients, locoregional by contiguity in 5 where 3 whose originated in the sinuses.
All patients received triple antibiotic therapy.
The surgical management by trépanoponction was indicated in 16 patients.
The clinical outcome was favorable in 14 patients.
Three patients died.

CONCLUSION
Brain abscess is a common condition in Mali.


RESULTS
Twelve cases meeting the criteria were selected among a total of 1229 stroke admissions, or a prevalence of stroke and rheumatic valvular atrial fibrillation of 0.97%.
The sex ratio was equal to 1 with an average age 36 years ±2 where the youngest and oldest patients were 24 and 48 years old.
The most common medical antecedents were rheumatic valvular heart disease and throat angina.
The cardiological clinical aspect was dominated by an irregular beat and in neurological terms aphasia and right hemiplegia dominated 1/3 of cases.
The atrial fibrillation was the constant electric signal with a dominant mitral valve impairment as observed via Doppler echocardiography.
The cerebral scanner showed that the ischemia was constant.

CONCLUSION
Its management is complex, prevention remains the only effective measure.


RESULTS
A seroprevalence of 12.5% was recorded.
The average years worked were 25±3.

RESULTS
The treatment consisted of a subtotal gastrectomy with ganglionic curettage taking out the first and the second relays in 33 patients (39.28%), total gastrostomy in 3 patients (3.57%), and the remaining 48 patients (57.14%) underwent gastro-entero anastomosis.
Morbidity was 10.7%, represented by 7 cases of parietal suppuration and 2 cases of evisceration.
Mortality rate was 11.11%, due to poor general condition of the patients.
The global 1-year survival rate was 36.9%.
The one and two-year survival rates after subtotal gastrostomy were 93.9% and 75.75%, respectively.
No survival case was noticed one year after total gastrectomy and gastric enteric anastomosis.


METHODS
Perinatal mortality premature to university clinics was estimated and logistic regression was used to identify the determinants.

RESULTS
During the study period, premature mortality was 15.2% (95% CI 9.7 to 20.7).
Determinants of perinatal mortality were: the birth weight of less than 1500g (OR: 5.66, 95% CI 1.87 to 17.1, p = 0.002) and gestational age.


INTRODUCTION
In urgency, the determination of the predictive anatomical factors of difficult intubation is secondary.
The incidence of the complications of endotracheal intubations in urgency in the French system was 11,6% with a rate of failure to 0,5.

RESULTS
For the period of study 120 cases of accidents and incidents were collected for 320 intubated patients - a frequency of 37,5%.
The age bracket 15 - 29 was prevalent representing 30,8 % of patients.
The sex ratio was 2,3 in favour of men.
In 44.3% of cases patients died in the 24 hours following intervention.
Only patients admitted for cranial traumatism presented undesirable side effects in 50% of the cases versus 50% for the other joined reasons for admission.


RESULTS
The sex ratio was 1.34 M/1F.
The mean age of patients was 8 ± 4 years.
In 58.71% (128/218) the onset of crises was before the age of five and decreased gradually until adolescence.
The EEG showed an epileptic focus in 161 patients (73.85%).
The main foci were centro-temporal (19.9%), frontal (19.2%), temporal (14.9%) and fronto-temporal (14.9%).
The CT-scan was abnormal in 58 (56.86%) of 102 patients, who performed head CT-scan, with as major abnormalities, brain atrophy and after-effects lesions.
Etiological factors were found in 76.15 % of patients, it was mainly neonatal asphyxia (21%), family history of epilepsy (20.6%) and febrile seizures (19.7%).
Focal epilepsies were of structural (51.4%), genetic (24.3%) or unknown causes.
Neurological abnormalities associated were more frequently in focal epilepsies of structural causes.

CONCLUSION
The main etiological factors are family history of epilepsy and neonatal asphyxia.


CONCLUSION

Among the carers, 37% did not know that the tubercular patient should not be isolated by their circle of acquaintances, 19.2% assured the supervision of medicine intake.
Respectively, 1.4% and 5.8% believe that tuberculosis is associated with witchcraft and divine punishment.
Approximately two thirds of the carers refused to share the same dish as the tubercular patient.


RESULTS
We found no significant difference between the prevalence of periodontal disease in pregnant women and non-pregnant women in contrast to literature data.
These analyzes revealed that dental cavity and simultaneous use of standard or vegetal toothbrushes have a statistically significant relationship with periodontal disease.
These two variables are predictors of periodontal disease in pregnant women at the MCLH.


RESULTS
153 patients were dialysed during our period of study, 48 died (mortality rate: 31,4%).
On these 48 deaths, 36 files were retained.
The average age of the patients was 48.3 years with extremes of 16 and 73 years.
The age bracket from 35 to 65 years was the most affected with 77% of deaths.
The patients of less than 35 years and those of more than 65 years represented respectively 16% and 5% of deaths.
The sex-ratio was 3.5 (M:W).
For the hemodialysis, 75% of patients had benefited from a central venous catheter (CVC) and 25% of an artério-venous fistula (FAV).
On 27 patients having used a central venous catheter as vascular access, 20 died in the first year of dialysis (74%).
Thirteen (13) of our patients had interrupted their sessions of hemodialysis.
The causes of death were dominated by infections (16 cases) followed by cardiovascular diseases (11 cases) and acute anaemia (5 cases).
Sixty one percent of the patients died less than one year after the beginning of the hemodialysis sessions; 11.1% after 2 years.
The rate of survival of our patients was 50% after 6 months of dialysis, 33.3% after 1 year and only 8.3% after 2 years.

CONCLUSION
The mortality rate of haemodialysis is high in Togo with a very low survival a year following treatment.

CHU Gabriel TOURÉ accounted for 55.1%, the majority came from the department of cardiology with 18.4%.
Doctors accounted for the largest square with 47.0%.
The majority of our practitioners (59%) say it takes at least one session during three medical consultations to diagnose the HBP.
Only 29,60% define the HBP from 140/90 mm Hg.
With a blood pressure goal of 58, 30% and 57.20% of practitioners claimed to retain 140/90 mm Hg, respectively for the diabetic and the renal-insufficient patients.
A considerable number of our practitioners (27.9%) still used in pregnant women the triplet diuretic/IEC/diet without salt.
The information of patients on some important aspects of the pathology prior to any therapeutic strategy had been conducted in 63.6.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a prospective, descriptive study conducted from August 2, 2007 to October 3, 2007 at the neonatology department and the delivery room of the Yopougon teaching hospital .
All newborn babies presenting a risk factor of infection have been included in this study.
A bacteriological evaluation including containing central, peripheral and gastric fluid samples was performed.

CONCLUSION
Chronic renal failure is a frequent complication of the hypertension.
Some biological tests are necessary for the diagnosis.
Renal ultrasound remains a useful test for its assessment.


CONCLUSION
In this context, the burn is more responsible for deaths.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective study over a 24 years period (1984-2007).

RESULTS
During the study period, 1868 acute peritonitis were operated on in the three major health centres of Bamako and Kati.
We collected data concerning 543 typhoid ileal perforations which represented 29.0% of all peritonitis.
The peritonitis by typhoid perforation constituted 28.5% of the peritonitis in the teaching hospital of the Point G, 30.6% in the Gabriel Touré teaching hospital and 6.4% in the teaching hospital of Kati.
Among the peritonitis by typhoid perforation, 56.7% were listed in the Point G teaching hospital, 43.0% in the Gabriel Torre teaching hospital and 0.3% in the Kati teaching hospital.
The typhoid ileum perforation remains the 2nd overall cause of generalized peritonitis after that of appendicular origin.


RESULTS
The data from 120 patients meeting the inclusion criteria was collected.
The average age was 22.7 years old.
Triad abdominal pains (120 cases; 100%), vomiting (41; 62.3%), lack of matter and gas (22; 32.3%) constituted the main part of the functional signs.
The physical examination showed a localised abdominal defence (7 cases, 10.3%), generalized defence (98 cases; 81.6%), and 2 unspecified cases (2.9%).
A "wood belly" abdomen was palpated among 105 patients (87.5%), as well as umbilical hernias (106 cases; 88.3%).
The Felix and Widal agglutination test was positive for 75 patients (62.5%) and negative for 27 patients (22.5%).
During the operation, the quantity of aspirated pus was higher than 1500 ml in 2 cases and lower or equal to 500 ml in 57.4% of cases.
The site of the perforation was ante mesenteric in 64 cases (53.3%).
Excision-suture and abdominal cleansing were the most common surgical procedures (68 cases; 57%).
Postoperatively 19 patients (15.83%) died of septic shock.
The average duration of hospitalization was 20.6 days.

CONCLUSION
The peritonitis by typhoid ileum perforation is still the cause of a high mortality rate in our country.


RESULTS
The average age of patients was 37.2 years ± 17.0.
The clinical picture was dominated by abdominal pain (92%), abdominal defense (92%), and fever (84%).

CONCLUSION
Postoperative peritonitis are rare in our service.
When they occur their rate of morbidity and mortality are high.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Our study was retrospective from January 2000 to December 2009 (10 years).

RESULTS
We recorded 96 patients operated for volvulus of sigmoid over 882 cases of bowel obstruction, a rate of 10.9%.
The average age was 47.2 years ± 18.9.
In per-operative, there was a necrosis of the colon rate of 16.7% (14 cases).
Performed surgical treatment modalities were: sigmoidectomy with primary anastomosis in 29.2% of cases (28), sigmoidectomy followed by colostomy and secondary anastomosis in 60.4% of patients (58) and 10.4% rare of simple devolvulation.


RESULTS
We noted a hospital admittance rate of 3.1% with an average age of 26.3 years old and a 1.66 men to women ratio.
Peritonitis at the Sominé Dolo hospital was dominated by intestinal perforation.
The diagnosis was essentially made using the clinical approach.
The treatment was medico-surgical.
Operative mortality was recorded in 7 cases (17.5%) with 7 cases of inner-wall abscesses.
The delay of consultations and the Mannheim score were the main factors causing bad prognostics.
Excision - sutures associated with a cleansing drainage of the abdominal cavity was the most practised surgical procedure.

CONCLUSION
Mortality remains high.


RESULTS
In 5 years time we gathered 105 cases of ileal typhoid perforation.
After surgical treatment early outcomes were simple in 70 patients (66.6%), a parietal suppuration had been noted in 15 patients (14.3%) and fistula in 4 (3.9%).
Sixteen patients (15.2%) died.
Sex, anaemia, surgeon, and perforation diameter did not significantly influence the rate of complications.


RESULTS
The patients were 12 to 59 years old with a mean age of 27.7 years and a sex-ratio of 9 to 1 for men.
17/53 patients received non-surgical treatment.
The rate of laparotomia was of 30.2% and postoperative morbidity 15.1%.


RESULTS
Mean age: 26 years old.
Ultrasounds confirmed the existence and location of the lesion on the erectile tissue in 2 cases.
No post operatory complication occurred.

CONCLUSION
The diagnosis of penile fracture remains clinical.


CONCLUSION
The common mesentery poses a diagnostic and therapeutic problem.


Results
The FNRE journal contained 168 authored texts, of which 36 were research studies (21%).
Four of these were clinical research studies on FN effect or benefit (2%).
Another five were obtained through the handsearch.
The included studies were conducted on adults or children, symptomatic or not, and investigated various interventions consisting of single or multiple stimuli, of varied nature, all primarily said to be provided to stimulate brain areas.
Conditions included attention deficit disorders, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders, autism-spectrum disorders, cortical visual impairment, traumatic brain injury, and migraine.
Balance and the "blind spot" were investigated in healthy subjects.
Major design and methodological issues were identified and discussed for all the nine studies; only four were considered as (potentially) appropriate for further scrutiny.
However, these were of low methodological quality and, therefore, no robust evidence could be found in relation to the effect or benefit of the tested FN interventions.


RESULTS
Questionnaires were completed by 38 participants, 18 in the control group and 20 in the intervention group.
The mean age was 62.2 (standard deviation [SD] 13.6) years and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.
The mean baseline questionnaire scores were similar for the control and intervention groups (20.4 [SD 7.3] v. 20.6 [SD 6.7]).
However, the mean scores on the follow-up questionnaire were significantly different between the 2 groups (20.2 [SD 4.0] v. 23.2 [SD 4.9], p = 0.02).
There was no change in the scores on the 2 questionnaires in the control group, whereas, in the intervention group, the mean score was significantly higher after the intervention (p = 0.03).


RESULTS
Forty-five residents (21 surgical and 24 nonsurgical; 31 men and 14 women) participated in the study.


METHODS
The databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane reviews and CINAHL were searched.
Articles that described objective assessment of acute incisional wounds were included.
Items for the wound-assessment tool were then extracted from eligible studies based on the frequency of reporting.
A multidisciplinary panel of wound experts compiled the items into an initial tool to assess key domains of wound healing.
The items were reduced through several iterations of panel discussion.

RESULTS
Our search strategy yielded 3743 results, which were screened by title and abstract.
Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review for the development of the wound-assessment tool, and 10 domains were extracted based on frequency of reporting.


METHODS
Using a scoping design, we performed a systematic search of Medline and Embase.

RESULTS
The mean change in catastrophizing score as assessed with the PCS ranged from 0 to -19, and that with the CSQ, from +0.07 to -13.
Clinically important changes in catastrophizing were observed in 7 studies (15%).


RESULTS
A total of 153 patients were included, of whom 76 (49.7%) received preoperative RT because of concerns of a compromised mesorectal fascia.
The median length of follow-up was 4.5 years.
The number of CRM-positive cases in the RT and no-RT groups was 16 (22%) and 1 (1%), respectively (p < 0.01), and the number of cases of local tumour recurrence was 5 (7%) and 2 (3%), respectively (p = 0.2).
Rates were similar when only patients with stage II/III tumours were included.
Overall, 26 patients (17.0%) received MRI.


RESULTS
Twelve sites reported resident coverage.
Most services did not include trauma.
Ten sites had protected operating room time.
Overall, 393 patient encounters occurred during the study period (195/386 [50.5%] operative and 191/386 [49.5%] nonoperative), with a mean of 3.8 operations per service.
The patient population was complex, with 136 patients (34.6%) having more than 3 comorbidities.


RESULTS
We enrolled 133 patients (94 men [70.7%] and 39 women [29.3%] with a mean age of 65.3 years).
The most common index admission diagnosis was peripheral artery disease (67 patients [50.4%]).
At 30 days, 19 patients (14.8%) had been readmitted or had visited the emergency department, most commonly after lower extremity revascularization (19.4%).
Ten patients were readmitted a mean of 16.8 days following discharge; surgical site infection was the most common cause for readmission (3 patients).
The most common treatment was antimicrobial therapy (4 patients).
The mean hospital length of stay was 14.4 days.
Nine patients presented to the emergency department a mean of 10.6 days after discharge; 6 reported a wound issue, and most (6 of 9) were managed with oral antibiotic treatment.


RESULTS
The ACS team was involved in the care of 359 patients, 176 (49.0%) of whom were admitted under the direct care of the ACS team.
Nonoperative care was indicated in 82 patients (46.6%) admitted to the ACS service and 151 (82.5%) of those admitted to a non-ACS service (p < 0.001).
Bowel obstruction (37 patients [21.0%]) was the most common reason for admission, followed by wound/abscess (24 [13.6%), biliary disease (24 [13.6%]) and appendiceal disease (23 [13.1%]).
Rates of 30-day return to the emergency department and readmission were 17.0% and 9.1%, respectively, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 1.7%.


METHODS
We used the χ2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare groups and performed the Mantel-Cox log-rank test for Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.
We compared the CTG group to all patients in the PTG group and to a 5:1 propensity-matched PTG cohort.

RESULTS
We analyzed data for 64 patients (9 CTG, 55 PTG).
The groups were equivalent at baseline and had similar operative, perioperative treatment and pathologic characteristics.
At 5 years, there was no difference in disease-free survival (28% v. 58%, p = 0.4) or overall survival (33% v. 44%, p = 0.7).

INTRODUCTION
Angio-lymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is a very rare dermatological vasoproliferative disease with unknown etiology.

RESULTS
Young man of 16 years without a specific antecedent, presents pruritic nodules of the lower limbs.
Ultrasound is a revealed nodules of the thighs, hypo-echo of varying size polylobed feeling in the subcutaneous fat in contact with the cutaneous coating.
They are surrounded by hyperechogenic infiltration of the cellulo-fatty tissue.
The most voluminous ones contain arteriovenous vascular branches without shunt, confirmed in color and pulsed Doppler mode.

OBJECTIVES
To describe severe malaria cases with bacterial infection.

RESULTS
15 of the 86 severe malaria cases had bacterial infections: enteritis (7 cases), urinary tract infection (4 cases), meningitis (4 cases), pneumonia (cases), sepsis (1 case), and sinusitis (1 case).
Convulsions, jaundice, abnormal bleeding, pulmonary edema were more frequent in patients with associated infections.
The average number of leukocytes and CRP were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection.
The mean parasite density was higher in patients without bacterial infection (56,362/mm3 vs. 239,162.2 ± 3326/mm 3 ± 7175.3).
Lethality was higher in patients with bacterial infection (20% versus 16.9%).


RESULTS
Maxillary radiography was performed on 96% of patients and biopsy in 66.3% of cases.
Conservative surgery was performed in 50% of patients and radical surgery in 26.5% of cases.


RESULTS
Of the 2517 patients received during the study period, 64 had PFP, a prevalence of 2.54%.
HIV serology was performed in 56 patients, 24 of whom had a positive serological reaction, a prevalence of 42.86%.
The young adult population was the most exposed, with an average age of 34.5 years.
There were 9 men and 15 women, or a sex ratio of 0.6.
In 70.83% of cases, the consultation period occurred between the 1st and 3rd week.
Unilateral facial asymmetry and persistent opening of the palpebral fissure were the main clinical signs.
A total of 75% of our patients were infected with HIV1.
CD4 levels ranged from 175 to 400/mm3.
All our patients had received PFP and HIV treatments.
The evolution was marked by a complete recovery with no sequelae of PFP in 62.5% of cases.

CONCLUSION
The prognosis of these PFPs is often good despite the delay in diagnosis.


INTRODUCTION
However, factors of mobi-mortality are still numerous.
PATIENT AND

RESULTS
269 medical files were analysed.
Mean age was of 28.46 ± 6.702.
The most frequent peroperative morbidity factors were cardiovascular.
Death rate was of 5.2%.
The most frequent cause of these deaths was eclampsia.
Factors influencing morbi-mortalities were iterative caesareans and urgency of the caesarean.
The evacuated mothers had presented complications in 37.3% of cases.


RESULTS
A total of 29 patients were operated; 28 women and 1 man with a mean age of 34 years.
Their body mass index (BMI) ranged between 35 and 49 kg/m2 with comorbidities.
The laparoscopic procedure was possible in all cases without conversion.

CONCLUSION
The sleeve gastrectomy is a feasible technique with our current working conditions.
It requires a good patient selection, and a multidisciplinary team.


RESULTS
Of the 227 patients surveyed, 54.62% (n=124) were satisfied with their experience of the surgical emergencies department.


RESULTS
In total, 41 patients were included in this study with a sex ratio of 1.3.
The average age was 55.3 ± 2.5 years.
The average duration of the aphasia was 10 months.
Broca's aphasia was predominant (68.3%).
60.8% of aphasia patients were able to preserve their quality of life.
Multivariate analysis showed that age, family support, the type of stroke and aphasia and speech therapy were associated with quality of life.


RESULTS
All students surveyed had heard of contraception.
The proportion of students who have had sexual intercourse is 91.2%.

CONCLUSION
The analysis of data from this study helps to know that emergency contraception is well known by students in medical academia.


RESULTS
Three hundred four (304) healthcare professionals, 187 men and 117 women (sex ratio of 1.59) were investigated.
The average age was of 40.84 years with extremes of 26 and 60 years.
Their level of knowledge, attitude and practice on sugar induced diabetes varied from one professional category to another.
Clinical signs of the disease, as well as its physiopathology were well known by healthcare providers.
However, the definition of the disease, its diagnostic criteria, its classification by cause, were little known general practitioners.
The general practitioners, had a good attitude and practice in front of a case of diabetes compared to other professional categories.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a prospective study conducted over a period of 12 months in the orthopedic trauma unit of the Cocody Abidjan University Hospital.
Thirty-seven patients with various types of wounds were included in the study.
Honey dressings were made every 48 hours.

CONCLUSION
The use of honey in wound treatment dates back to ancient times.
Currently we are rediscover its healing properties.
Because of its high sugar concentration and its acidic pH, the honey is undeniably a hyperosmotic environment which inhibits the growth of pathogens.
Honey also contains two product groups that act directly as antibacterial agents.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
It was a retrospective and prospective longitudinal investigation.
All the patients under antituberculous treatment of 2nd line between January 1st, 2010 and the August 31st, 2013 were included.

RESULTS
71 cases of multi resistant tuberculosis (MRT) were included.
The sex-ratio was 3.4.
The age bracket from 30 to 39 was the most represented (39.4 %).
A notion of tubercular contage was found in 18 (25.3%) patients.
All MRT patient had histories of treatment including aminoside lasting more than 2 months.
Intolerance of the treatment was reported in 57 patients.
Intolerance predominated in 30 to 39 years olds and in Tuberculosis/HIV co-infected patients.
The neurological (47.9%) and psychiatric (47.9%) infringements were the most represented.
Vestibulocochlear impact was seen in 42.3% of cases with 18.3% reporting of total deafness.


RESULTS
Among 702 admissions, 158 patients, with a mean age of 20 ± 4 were hospitalized for eclampsia (22.5%).
We recorded 106 cases of first pregnancies (67.1%) and 104 primiparous (65.8%).
The admission period after the first seizure was over 6 hours for 90 patients (57%).
The first seizure had occurred in ante-partum period for 69 patients, in per-partum period for 4 patients and in postpartum period for 85 patients.
Ninety-three patients (59%) had consciousness disorders at admission, 12 patients received oxygen treatment .
Vaginal delivery was the mode of delivery for 93 patients and cesarean section for 65 patients.
Maternal and perinatal lethality was 9.5% and 10.8% respectively.


RESULTS
The sample size was 63 patients or 50.6% of patients awaiting heart transplantation.
The mean age of patients was 47.66 ± 12.79 years, sex ratio Male:Female 2.70.
The circumstances of transplantation were: super-emergency (37%), non-emergency (63%) and in 1/3 of redux surgery.
The primary dilated cardiomyopathy was the main causal disease with 38.1% of cases.

CONCLUSION
The clinical and paraclinical profile has not changed much over the last 5 years.


INTRODUCTION
Our work aimed to determine the frequency and type of kidney lesions in an adult carrying pure nephrotic syndrome.


BACKGROUND
Road traffic accidents are major causes of mortality and morbidity.

RESULTS
A total of 143 patients were admitted.
The prevalence of accidents was 8.66%.
The mean age of patients was 31.5 ± 12.2 years.
The male sex was the most affected 72%.
Automobiles were most involved 67.1%.
The frequency of these accidents was higher in March at 30.1%.
The injuries were the most common lesions with 86.1% of cases and the head was the most affected with 48.3%.
Half of these accidents occurred between 8 o'clock and 12 o'clock.
We observed 4.9% of deaths.


RESULTS
Rare elbow fractures represented 19.42% of total elbow fractures during the study period.
Male dominance was clear: 28 boys for 6 girls with a sex ratio of 4.66:1.
The average age of the children was 8.2 years with extreme of 3 and 15 years.
These fractures, in most cases, were the result of a play accident in 16 cases (47.1%).
The main reason for consultation was represented by a sore elbow (91.2%).
Trauma was found in the right elbow 61.8% of the time and in the left elbow 38.2%.
Among the most common fractures were those of the lateral epicondyle and the olecranon which accounted for 11 cases (6.28%) and 10 cases (5.71%) of all fractures of the elbow.
Twenty-one children received orthopedic treatment and 13 children received surgical treatment.
The average assessment of our patients follow-up was 10 months with extreme of 6 months and 16 months.
The results were good in 32 children without any radiological abnormality or functional sequelae.

CONCLUSION
Monitoring should be continued long term to watch the sequelae.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
HIV cases were not included.
The syndromic approach was used.

RESULTS
We obtained the following results: 460 cases of STI (Dysuria, Cystitis, Scrotal swelling, Prostatitis).
The sex ratio was 20.52 in favor of the male sex.
The age group 23-32 years was the most affected, and non-married single patients were the most represented.
The majority were Bambara.
All cases were diagnosed clinically.
Additional tests were requested to confirm the diagnosis.
In terms of syndromic management, probabilistic antibiotic therapy was applied to each type of STI.
Antibiotic therapy was rehabilitative with an effective therapeutic response in 61.61% of cases for prostatitis, 98.60% for urethritis, 100% for scrotal swelling, 90.78% for cystitis.


RESULTS
The study included 200 patients aged over 40 years old, with an average age of 57.6 years.
The primary reason for ophthalmologic consultation was a decrease in visual acuity (55.9%) followed by headaches (23.1%).


RESULTS
The mean age was 28 years with extremes of 1 year and 46 years old.
The circumstances of occurrence were dominated by road traffic accidents (12 cases), an aggression by firearms.
The timeout of consultation varied between 1 hour in 1 day.
Enlarged and painful scrotum was the most frequent motive for consultation (n=12).
In the physical examination the trauma was closed in 10 cases, and opened in 3 cases.
The average hospital stay was of 5 days with extremes at one day and 1 month.
Immediate postoperative recoveries were simple in all patients except two.


RESULTS
Postoperative complications occurred in 7 patients.
In these patients, treatment consisted of a fixation pin by open reduction.
Sequelae were represented by a stiff wrist in 3 cases (5.6%), and limitation of prono-supination in 1 case (1.8%).


RESULTS
The hospital strains were more resistant to penicillin than the extra-hospital strains (95% versus 88%; p = 0,016).
The MRSA clinical isolates prevalence was 46% in 2007, 63% in 2008 and 80% in 2009.
The high level resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins was more frequent in the MRSA strains than in the MSSA strains.


RESULTS
Waste management is inadequate at all levels.


INTRODUCTION
Treatment of cataract blindness is surgical to restore vision.


RESULTS
Seventy-one patients were managed during the study period, giving a hospital frequency of 10 cases per annum.
The average age of our patients was 5.8 years [1 day and 15 years].
The mean time to consultation was 4.5 years [1 day and 15 years].
Most patients consulted for absence of the testis (n = 62).
All patients were full term births.
Clinically, the undescended testis was categorized as: cryptorchidism (n = 45), ectopia testis (n = 2), intra-abdominal testis (n = 24), retractile testis (n = 7), vanishing testis (n = 4).
Single stage open orchidopexy according to Surraco using an incision in the lower inguinal crease was performed in 66 cases (93%).
With a mean follow-up of 3 months, testicular atrophy was found in 5.6% of cases in our series.


CONCLUSION
Of challenges remain to improve the knowledge, attitudes and practices of patients.
Therapeutic education is necessary for all diabetics.


INTRODUCTION
The hematologic abnormalities constitute a reccuring problem in the general population.

RESULTS
We colliged 154 people among whom, a female prevalence was noted with a sex ratio M/F of 0.64.
The age bracket from 18 to 29 years was represented (50%) with a 32.94 years median age ± 10 with the 18 and 75 years extremes represented by 50% of single people.
The HIV infection prevalence was 20.37%.
Anaemia was the most frequent hematologic abnormality (44.44%) its hypochromic microcitic form microcytic (50%) especially.
The HIV positive patients had primarily a normochromic normocytic non regenerative anaemia (27.27%).
A morphological abnormality of the three blood lines (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) was found in 57.41% of our subjects.


RESULTS
The mean age was 53 years ranging from 32 to 68 years.
There was a female predominance with a sex ratio of 0.6.
Clinically, there was conjonctival palor and asthenia (92% each) followed by paresthesia (62%).
The blood cell count essentially showed profound anemia (7g/dl on average), macrocytic (84,6%), normocytic (15,3%), bicytopenia (61,5%) and pancytopenia (23% ).
The fibroscopy showed atrophic gastritis (76,9%), intestinal metaplasia (69,2%) and an absence of Helicobacter pylori.
The evolution was favorable with parenteral B12 vitamin therapy for all patients.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
A case-control study was carried out from 1 May 2013 to 31 July 2015 in the department of cardiology of Aristide le Dantec university hospital.

RESULTS
There was a male predominance with a sex ratio of 1.6 in both groups.
The mean age was 62.26 years for diabetics and 59.06 years for non-diabetics (p = 0.6).
In diabetics, symptomatology was dominated by silent ischemia (48.9%) versus typical angina pain (68.9%) in non-diabetics.
Myocardial infarction was the most common indication of coronary angiography in both groups.
Angioplasty was indicated in 37.8% of diabetics versus 63.9% of non-diabetics.
Nine diabetic patients and three non-diabetic patients had an indication of coronary artery bypass grafting.


INTRODUCTION
Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are embryopathies; they represent 8% of congenital malformations.
There are several types: hiatal hernia, retro-costo-xiphoid hernia and posterior-lateral hernia called Bochdalek.
Its incidence is estimated at 1/3200 live births, which represents 0.06% to 6% of cases of diaphragmatic hernias; it is predominant on the left in 85%.
It may be in the neonatal period or late and the clinical signs are polymorphic.
The purpose of this study is to recall the clinical and radiological aspects of this disease and discuss its treatment.
RESULT
We report a case of a 3-year-old child with a history of recurrent broncho- pneumopathy since the age of one month admitted to the pediatric emergency department in an acute respiratory distress, radiography revealed a congenital diaphragmatic hernia operated.

CONCLUSION
His treatment is surgical and the prognosis is generally good in the absence of major malformations associated.


Background
These changes may lead to considerable consequences on the prevalence of sexually transmitted disease, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Results
Eighteen studies from 9 countries were identified.


Background
Pregnant women comprise a vulnerable population owing to the changes they experience in various stages that affect their mental health.
Mental health problems affects nearly one-fifth of pregnant women during the prenatal and postpartum periods.


Methods
Trial registration number: ACTRN12618000960257.

Results
No changes were seen in Group C.


Background
The Syrian pharmacovigilance (PV) system consists of a PV unit responsible for all related activities at the national level.

Results
The response rate was 77%.
Fifty-five percent of pharmacists had an acceptable level of knowledge about PV.


Methods
This was a cross-sectional study of 125 parents of children with any type of ADHD who were selected by systematic random sampling.
The study was conducted between May and December 2015 in the Outpatient Family Medicine Clinic at Suez Canal University Hospital.

Results
Median physical, psychological and social domain scores were 12, and mean environmental domain score was 11.9.
The median scores of perception of health and QOL of the parents were 3.0.
Most of the families (79.2%) were dysfunctional.


Background
In 2012, the World Health Assembly declared ending polio a "programmatic emergency for global public health".


Results
Such an enabling environment is imperative to improve accessibility and availability to essential medical and pharmaceutical commodities in the supply chain management.


Results
We identified 9611 patients meeting inclusion criteria.


Results
There were 534 living kidney donors with a median follow-up of 7 years (maximum 13 years).
The median age at the time of donation was 41 years and 62% were women.
Overall, 25% of donors had all 3 markers of care (physician visit, serum creatinine, albuminuria measurement) in each year of follow-up.


Results
A total of 1299 consecutive deceased donor kidney transplant recipients were included.
The median follow-up was 5.5 years.
Mean donor age increased from 27 to 64 years across ascending KDRI quintiles.
All-cause mortality was increased for the highest KDRI quintile only.


Diagnoses
Together these findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of stage III LN.


Methods
To identify and screen high-risk groups in remote communities, we trained volunteer screeners, mainly those who had themselves received treatment for tuberculosis or had a family history of the disease.
A non-profit organization was created and screeners received training on the disease and its transmission at 3-day workshops.
Data were evaluated every quarter during the 3-year period of the intervention (2014-2016).

Findings
Acceptability of the intervention was high.
Volunteers screened 650 434 individuals in their communities, 73 418 of whom reported a prolonged cough; 50 368 subsequently attended a clinic for tuberculosis testing.
Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 1 in 151 people screened, costing 0.29 United States dollars (US$) per person screened and US$ 44 per person diagnosed.
The intervention resulted in an additional 4300 sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis diagnoses, 42% (4 300/10 247) of the provincial total for that period.


Methods
We also assessed the association between vaginal birth after caesarean section and maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Findings
We analysed 871 636 deliveries by women with a previous caesarean section.
Both in 2012 and 2016, the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section was 9.8%.
After adjusting for institutional, sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, the rate increased by 14% between 2012 and 2016 (adjusted relative risk, aRR: 1.14; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.07-1.21).


Methods
We then applied the thresholds to data from the 2017 influenza season.

Findings
We were able to measure and produce thresholds for each severity indicator.
At least one laboratory-confirmed influenza parameter was used to measure each indicator.
When thresholds were applied to the 2017 season, there was good agreement across all data sources in measuring activity for each indicator.
The season was characterized as having high transmissibility and extraordinary impact.
This matched the description of the season produced by the Australian national influenza surveillance committee, based on expert opinion and historical ranges.


Methods
We developed a Markov model to estimate the lifetime costs and effects, in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of a breast cancer screening programme for high-risk women aged 40-69 years.
We derived or adopted age-specific incidence and transition probability data, assuming a natural history progression between the stages of cancer, from other studies.
We obtained lifetime direct and indirect treatment costs in 2014 United States dollars (US$) from surveys of breast cancer patients in 37 Chinese hospitals.
To calculate QALYs, we derived utility scores from cross-sectional patient surveys.
We evaluated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for various scenarios for comparison with a willingness-to-pay threshold.

Findings
Our baseline model of annual screening yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 8253/QALY, lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$ 23 050/QALY.
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results are robust.
The cost-effectiveness of the screening is reduced if not all diagnosed women seek treatment.
Finally, the economic benefit of screening women aged 45-69 years with both ultrasound and mammography, compared with mammography alone, is uncertain.


Key findings
Eleven studies met inclusion criteria and selected for data extraction.


RESULTS
A mean (± SD) Vent:RT ratio of 5.1:1±2.818 was determined.
Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated no significant differences between findings of the three data collection points (F [1.7,30.5]=0.695; P=0.492).

CONCLUSIONS
The present study is the first to report the Vent:RT ratio and RT practice patterns in Canadian adult ICUs.


RESULTS
Among 214 participants, 206 (96%) and 195 (91%) completed the pre- and post-participation questionnaires, respectively.
The majority agreed (14%) or strongly agreed (75%) that NIV education was important for their role.


RESULTS
Patient incidents were positive in 188 on-call logs; emerging from these were 227 incident types.
Patient incidents were associated with mild harm in 87 cases.


RESULTS
A disproportionally higher number of Aboriginal women reported experiencing abuse, as compared to non-Aboriginal women.


INTRODUCTION
South Asians have a higher than average risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

RESULTS
832 participants were recruited (584 under age 40).


CONCLUSIONS
Improved quality postabortion care provision is also needed, including World Health Organization-recommended methods.


Background
The presence of a regional medical campus (RMC) could influence physicians' choice.

Methods
Thirteen semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with practicing physicians.
Data were analyzed using QDAMiner.


Background
Interdisciplinary teaching (IDT) is the norm in Canadian family medicine residency programs.


Results
A total of 113 Canadian plastic surgeons met inclusion criteria.
The majority of respondents were male (76%), with 50% in practice for more than 15 years.
Surgeons demonstrated a trend toward immobilization after splinting (48%), instead of early mobilization after splinting (21%).
When results were stratified by years in practice, no differences in surgical and non-surgical management were found, although surgeons in practice for less than 15 years were more likely to suggest hand therapy.

Conclusion
These findings demonstrate inconsistencies in management of single metacarpal fractures among Canadian plastic surgeons.
Surprisingly, surgeons in the survey tended to favor immobilization, as oppose to the literature that favors mobilization.


Results
Restriction of DIPJ flexion led to a 20% decrease in grip strength (P < .
There was no significant difference between dominant and nondominant hands.


Objectives
Methods The study used the meta-analysis guideline provided by PRISMA using bladder cancer in Africa as the key search word.
PRISMA guidelines were used to screen for full-length hospital-based articles on cancer of the bladder in Africa.
These articles were analyzed under four subcategories which were pathogenesis, pathology, clinical presentation, and management.

Results
The result of evaluation of 821 articles yielded 23 full-length papers on hospital-based studies of cancer of the bladder in Africa.
Cancer of the bladder in most of Africa is still predominantly SCC (53%-69%).
There has been a notable increase in TCC in Africa (9%-41%).
The main management of SCC is open surgery.


Methods
A telephone survey was administered to pharmacists practising in the Canadian Forces Health Services Group.

Results
However, the number of ADR reports submitted did not increase.


Methods
An iterative design process, including activities such as semiotic analysis, design/redesign, and evaluation, was used to develop medication safety pictograms.
Nurses, physicians, pharmacists, and students listed and drew graphic elements to depict each of the 9 key medication safety issues.
Graduate students in graphic design developed the preliminary pictograms for the study.
A Delphi survey was then conducted with experts recruited from the International Pharmaceutical Federation to reach consensus on the pictograms and provide feedback to the graphic designers.
Health care providers from around the world were invited to participate in a survey to determine a preferred pictogram for each safety warning.

Results
These pictograms were then presented to 58 experts in 2 rounds of a Delphi process.
A total of 799 participants from 61 countries responded to the international preference survey.
Most of the participants (n = 536, 67.1%) were Canadian, and of those, 385 (71.8%) were pharmacists.


Results
Over the 9-month study period, 2417 patients were screened, of whom 871 were included in the study.
In relation to the Quebec guidelines, PPI prescription was inappropriate for 267 (30.7%) of the patients.


Results
The sperm protein content varied markedly from sample to another, especially in the high-molecular-weight range.
Using mass spectrometry, the 80-110 kDa bands were found to correspond primarily to three proteins from the flagellum's fibrous sheath: A-kinase anchor protein 4, A-kinase anchor protein 3, and spermatogenic cell-specific type 1 hexokinase.


Results
There were no differences in the types of infections (urinary, respiratory, hematologic, or other) between the 2 groups (P = .
585).


Background
However, little is known about the effectiveness of an eHealth portal for delivery of care to home dialysis patients.

Results
Of the 41 patients who consented to join the portal, 27 (66%) created an online account.
Similar results were observed for the care provided by other nephrology health care team members.


Methods
This was a qualitative study.

Conclusions
FPP is required to follow convenient implementation methods.
The mechanisms of payment in the health sector are weak and have no transparency.


Methods
The total of 712 married women were selected who answered a questionnaire.
Religiosity, family stability and general health self-rating scales were used.

Results
There was a significant difference among the three maternal age groups in the duration of breastfeeding.
A significant relationship was found between the duration of breastfeeding and all social, psychological and demographic variables except general health.
The duration of artificial feeding, number of abortions, degree of religiosity, family stability scale, age, and socioeconomic scale related to the duration of the mother's breastfeeding.


Results
(RIU) and 558 were in the neonatal intensive care service (NICS).
Sensitivity of pencil light examination was 71.4%.
Studies from the Middle East have shown potential recessive genetic causes of common paediatric ocular conditions.
In our study, consanguineous marriage was found to have a significant association with red reflex abnormality (P = 0.017).


Background
Reproductive health problems are a leading cause of women's ill health and mortality worldwide.
Despite the success in health care promotion in the Iranian health care system, women still need to receive sexual health care and appropriate HIV/AIDS services.
However, studies on the sexual and reproductive health care needs of Iranian women are lacking.

Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional study in 2013 on 514 women living in an urban area in the north of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Taking into consideration ethical principles, data were collected using the Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Needs Assessment Questionnaire.


Methods
Multistage stratified sampling was used to recruit 1302 married women of child-bearing age (15-49 years) attending primary health care centres in Mosul.
Women were interviewed using a validated questionnaire between April 2011 and 31 January 2012.
Data collected included: use of induced abortion and method, social and family background, and contraceptive use.
The χ2-test was used to assess the association of sociodemographic and cultural factors with the induced abortion.

Conclusions
Health education is recommended to encourage contraceptive use.


Methods
This was a sequential explanatory study using a mixed methods approach.
Data were collected on self-reported fruit and vegetables intake, eating behaviours, food availability and sociodemographic variables.
In the qualitative phase, 14 students were interviewed about their eating behaviour.

Results
A total of 620 students were included: 57% were boys and most reported medium/high family affluence.
Only 28% of the participants met the recommended daily fruit and vegetable intake, with significantly more males than females meeting it (P < 0.01).
Lunch was the most frequently eaten meal, breakfast was frequently skipped, and there were high levels of fast food and soft drink consumption.


Results
Inequality in the distribution of cataract surgery services decreased between 2006 and 2011: the Gini, concentration and dissimilarity indexes decreased by 0.028, 0.03 and 0.037, respectively.
However, cataract surgery delivery remained in favour of the better-off provinces.


Results
575 institutions were contacted of which 223 (38.3%) responded.
Moreover, only 23.3% reported measuring the impact of their health research.


Methods
The prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.

Results
The literature search yielded 265 articles, of which 8 were eligible for inclusion.
Financial issues were the greatest barrier to accessing health care for 66% (95% CI: 0.449-0.823%).


Results
Cancer among adolescents and young adults represents 16.3% of all new cancer cases and has increased by 25% over the past 12 years.


Results
Of 142 patients, 44 (31.0%) had at least one infection.
The incidence of infection was 36.2 per 100 patient-years by 2 years post-transplant.
A total of 32 (22.5%) patients had 56 infection-related hospitalizations with 73.2% occurring in the first year.


RESULTS
Most of the cases were females (55%).
Among youth (aged 10-19 years) and adults (aged 20-49 years), opioid use was associated with underlying mental illness.

CONCLUSION
The upstream determinants of opioid-related injuries are complex and likely vary by subpopulations.


RESULTS
Two-thirds (66%) of overdose cases were male and about half (49%) were 20-39 years old.
Over half of the cases (54%) visited the emergency department and about one-quarter (26%) were admitted to hospital in the year before the overdose event, compared with 17% and 9% of controls, respectively.
Nevertheless, nearly onefifth (19%) of cases were recorded leaving the emergency department without being seen or against medical advice.
High proportions of both cases (75%) and controls (72%) visited community-based physicians.
Substance use and mental health-related concerns were the most common diagnoses among people who went on to overdose.

CONCLUSION
People who overdosed frequently accessed the health care system in the year before the overdose event.


Results
001).


Methods
Using a scoping design, we performed a systematic search of MEDLINE and Embase.

Results
Clinically important changes in catastrophizing were observed in 7 studies (15%).


Results
A total of 153 patients were included, of whom 76 (49.7%) received preoperative RT because of concerns of a compromised mesorectal fascia.
The median length of follow-up was 4.5 years.
Rates were similar when only patients with stage II/III tumours were included.
Overall, 26 patients (17.0%) received MRI.


Results
Questionnaires were completed by 38 participants, 18 in the control group and 20 in the intervention group.
baseline questionnaire scores were similar for the control and intervention groups (20.4 [SD 7.3] v. 20.6 [SD 6.7]).
However, the mean scores on the follow-up questionnaire were significantly different between the 2 groups (20.2 [SD 4.0] v. 23.2 [SD 4.9], p = 0.02).
There was no change in the scores on the 2 questionnaires in the control group, whereas, in the intervention group, the mean score was significantly higher after the intervention (p = 0.03).

Conclusion
The use of an electronic booklet appears to improve patients’ knowledge of their surgical procedure.


Background
Postgraduate medical residency programs are laborious and timeintensive, and can be physically, intellectually and emotionally demanding.

Results
Forty-five residents (21 surgical and 24 nonsurgical; 31 men and 14 women) participated in the study.


Background
Inmates tend to be less healthy owing to socioeconomic factors and an increased number of medical and psychiatric comorbidities.
We compared revision and complication rates of total joint replacements in a cohort of incarcerated Canadians versus a cohort of non-inmates.


Methods
All patients who underwent a liver resection for HCC from January 2010 to June 2016 were included.
We used AKIN urine output and creatinine criteria to assess for AKI within 48 hours of surgery.

Results
Eighty liver resections were performed during the study period.
Cirrhosis was confirmed in 80%.
Median hospital stay was 9 (interquartile range 7–12) days, and 30-day mortality was 2.5%.


Methods
We used routinely collected data from recent household budget surveys in 14 European countries.
We calculated the incidence of catastrophic health spending and its distribution across consumption quintiles using four methods.

Findings
Country estimates of the incidence of catastrophic health spending were generally similar using the normative spending on food, housing and utilities method and the budget share method at the 10% threshold of a household's ability to pay.
The normative spending on food, housing and utilities method was the only one that produced an effective threshold that rose smoothly with total household expenditure.


Methods
We calculated two financial protection indicators using data from living standards surveys or household income and expenditure surveys in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.
Second, using World Bank poverty lines, we determined the impoverishing effect of health-care spending by households.
We also conducted an analysis of the main components of out-of-pocket expenditure.

Results
Spending on medicines was the main component of out-of-pocket spending in most of the countries.


Background
Kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of renal disease.

Results
During the study period, 6434 people (58% male; mean age: 47.9 years) underwent a kidney biopsy.
Tubulointerstitial diseases increased from 5.87% to 7.36% of total diagnoses.


RESULTS
A total of 2346 cases of breast cancer with a linked surgical procedure were included.


RESULTS
There were 24 surgeons in the training group and 23 in the no-training group.
Mean assessment tool scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups.
However, confidence intervals were wide and overlapping for all 3 tools.

CONCLUSION
For education purposes, the reliability of the visual analogue scale and GRS would be considered "good" for the training group but "moderate" for the no-training group.
Training did not significantly improve assessment tool reliability.
Although rater training may represent a way to improve reliability, further study is needed to determine effective training methods.


RESULTS
A total of 50 369 patients underwent emergent appendectomy over the study period, of whom 16 953 (33.7%) had a perforated appendix.
Overall, 14 451 patients (28.7%) (8428 [25.2%] in the nonperforated group and 6023 [35.5%] in the perforated group) had at least 1 complication.
The most common complication was an emergency department visit (7942 patients [15.8%]), followed by surgical site infection (4792 [9.5%]).
Increasing age, female sex, rural residence, perforation status, daytime surgery and open surgical technique were associated with increased risk of complications.

CONCLUSION
The most common complication was presentation to the emergency department.
Our definition of complications is more inclusive than in previous studies and provides a deeper understanding of complications after appendectomy.


RESULTS
Twenty-eight participants (16 same-day discharge, 12 standard care) were included.
Both groups experienced high levels of satisfaction with their care pathway.
Concerns and challenges identified in both groups pertained to mobility, pain, self-care and caregiver support.


RESULTS
The DUTL reached 3 N∙m the earliest in 45° of wrist flexion (p = 0.02).
There was no significant difference in these variables between the native and repaired DUTL.


RESULTS
Twenty-one students participated in the study.
There were no differences between RHAP and square knots in correct knot configuration, breaking strength or mechanism of failure.


RESULTS
Samples from 104 patients were tested.


METHODS
Respondents were asked to estimate the total cost, type and number of disposable equipment pieces required to perform open and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.
We determined the accuracy of estimates through comparisons with procedural invoices for distal gastrectomy performed between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2015.
All values are in 2015 Canadian dollars.

RESULTS
Of the 53 surveys sent out, 12 were completed (response rate 23%).
Estimates of total cost were within 25% of the median invoice total in 1 response (9%) for open cases and 3 (27%) of those for laparoscopic cases.


METHODS
We sent Web-based surveys and reminders to all Canadian cardiac surgical residents and program directors between February and July 2017.
We used descriptive analyses to summarize data in an aggregate and anonymous manner.
We analyzed patterned responses to open-ended survey questions using thematic analysis.

RESULTS
Seventy-eight of 92 residents (85%) and 11 of 12 program directors (92%) completed the survey, with broad representation from across Canada.
A minority of residents (14 [18%]) and program directors (4 [36%]) reported that TAVI training in their program was adequate.
Only 3 program directors (27%) reported that their residents had access to TAVI simulation training.


RESULTS
We included 50 patients in our study (25 per group).
The mean total cost for the early discharge group was $649.62 ± $281.71 versus $1279.71 ± $515.98 for the standard care group.
There were no significant differences in SF12 or WOMAC scores between groups at 1 year postoperative.


Results
The search yielded 2088 articles with one meeting eligibility criteria.
The trial examined thrust manipulation with exercise compared to sham.
Statistically significant improvements in pain and disability were reported within but not between groups.
Evidence quality according to the PEDro scale was good; GRADE was moderate.


Results
The primary theme was the prevention and treatment of spine and musculoskeletal conditions through chiropractic care.


Introduction
Melanoma can be a fatal form of skin cancer.
The prognosis rapidly deteriorates from the in situ stage (stage 0) to stage 4.
As such, early detection and treatment are key.


CONCLUSION
High use of this rural emergency department was not associated with limited use of primary care services.


Results
Over the 3-year follow-up period, 33.3% of dialysis patients and 6.2% of kidney transplant recipients died.
The discriminatory ability was moderate (C-statistic for dialysis: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.70, and C-statistic for transplant: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.69-0.75).
The 3-year observed and predicted mortality estimates were comparable and even more so after we recalibrated the intercepts in 2 of our models (dialysis and deceased donor kidney transplantation).
As done in the United States, we developed a Canadian Web site and an iOS application called Dialysis vs. Kidney Transplant- Estimated Survival in Ontario.


Presenting concerns of the patient
A 25 years old man with advanced liver cirrhosis caused by sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.

Diagnoses
Inferior vena cava stenosis.


RESULTS
All sites were challenged to prioritize care improvement for a small, complex population and varied levels of implementation were achieved.
Lower implementing sites showed more passive endorsement of the innovation and had lower capacity to implement.


INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is detected through screening or through signs and symptoms.

RESULTS
The provincial median diagnostic interval was 32 days, with county medians ranging from 15 to 65 days.
Provincially, 48.4% were diagnosed at a DAU, and this ranged from zero to 100% across counties.


Results
A total of 264 files were radomly pulled from approxinately 3750 clinic files.
The prevalence of HIV positive patients was 5.7% (15/264), predominantly males, with 3 patients having developed AIDS.
Co-infection with Hepatitis B and/or C was identified in 5/15 patients.
In addition to chiropractic, 7/15 patients reported receiving other complementary therapies.


Results
For hip flexion =90°, both PSISs moved cephalad.

Conclusions
This study questions the validity of the upright Gillet test for sacroiliac motion.


Objective
Clinical features


Clinical Features
Pain was constant but exacerbated with training and assuming the en pointe and demi-pointe dance positions.
Plantar flexion of the great toe was pain provoking.
A diagnosis of a chronic recurrent FHL stenosing tenosynovitis was made based on the history and physical exam.


Results
No adverse events were reported.


Presenting concern
Abdominal ultrasound revealed bilateral nephromegaly and hepatosplenomegaly.
The patient was promptly started on intravenous (IV) fluid and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Elements of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) were observed.


INTRODUCTION
As pediatric dentists, we are aware that this practitioner has to manage an emotional situation, often the first contact of a young child with dentistry, with sometimes complex clinical circumstances.
This review of the different emergency pathologies presents the characteristics, the diagnoses and treatments, analyzed with special attention to the role of the physician and the dentist. .


INTRODUCTION
Surgical practice in gastro-enterology is concerned by deep technological advances.
Medical practice does not only depend on the access to the technologies, but it seems submitted to her.
Should the physician follow the engineer ?
Who decides ?


METHODOLOGY
These messages are obviously based on the best methodologies applied on Belgian data.


Results
Higher self-efficacy was associated with lower cigarette and waterpipe smoking contemplation.
Risky behaviour was related to smoking maintenance.
A more positive attitude to smoking acceptability was related to higher waterpipe maintenance (odds ratio = 1.57 95% CI: 1.03-2.40).


Methods
Three weeks later, the YFAS 2.0-A was readministered to all participants.

Results
Cronbach's alpha for the YFAS 2.0-A was 0.89.


Methods
English and Farsi databases were searched from January to July 2016 to extract reports (up to December 2015) about priority setting in health research in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
We constructed a checklist to extract data from the identified studies.
Articles were studied in detail and content analysis was carried out.
Relevant items were scored and analysed using Microsoft Excel.

Results
We identified 36 articles.
Eight articles involved all the main stakeholders.
About half the articles used valid criteria for ranking.
Upstream rules and regulations were ignored in 26 articles.


Methods
We also gathered information through a survey and during a regional consultation in Tunisia.

Results
We found 24 publications on disaster from 5 countries in the Region and 16 publications on disaster preparedness and blood transfusion in casualties and severe trauma outside the Region.
However, none dealt with availability and safety of blood transfusion during humanitarian emergencies.
Armed conflicts and terrorism, flooding and earthquakes are the most frequent emergencies with 10-85% of the injured requiring blood transfusion.


Results
Totally, 1404 patients were included.


Results
Calibration was also poor for all models.


Methods
This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in 6 Fraser Health residential care facilities in British Columbia between April 1, 2015, and March 31, 2016.
Two definitions of "evidence-based indications" were used.
The second definition involved common evidence-based indications for PPI use, specifically GERD or PUD.
Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the primary outcome: the proportion of PPI orders without a documented broad or common evidence-based indication for PPI treatment.

Results
A total of 331 residential care patients and 407 PPI orders were assessed.
The proportion of PPI orders without a documented broad evidence-based indication was 16.2% (66/407).
The most frequently documented reason for a PPI order was GERD (214/407 or 52.6%).


Methods
This prospective observational study involved 60 consecutive patients admitted to a general medicine service at a tertiary care teaching centre starting on March 28, 2016.
The primary outcome was the number of serious ADRs, defined by Health Canada as ADRs that result in hospital admission, congenital malformation, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or death; that are life-threatening; or that require significant intervention to prevent one of these outcomes.
Medical records were reviewed independently by pairs of pharmacists for serious ADRs, and the likelihood of causality was assessed using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre system.
Inter-rater agreement was calculated using the kappa score, and disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Results
Twenty-three serious ADRs occurred in the sample of 60 patients.


INTRODUCTION
Sleep is essential for both physical and mental well-being.

RESULTS
The proportion of Canadians getting the recommended amount of sleep decreased with age, from 81% of preschoolers to 53% of older adults.
Boys with a learning disability or an attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and sedentary male youth had significantly higher odds of short sleep.
Among adults and older adults, both chronic stress and arthritis were associated with short sleep.


Results
Nineteen cases were performed on 16 patients.


Results
Eight participating participants were equally divided between OTHB and control groups.
The OTHB group had higher confidence scores in being seen in public (20.8 ± 1.7 versus 14.5 ± 1.3, P = .029).

Conclusion
So far, HBOT was mainly used in the treatment of problematic or chronic wounds.


Results
One hundred fifty-eight dog bite patients were identified.
Most patients were male (53.8%) and less than 5 years of age (50%).
Bites occurred most frequently in June (13.3%) and July (16.5%).
The face was most commonly involved (42.9%), followed by the hands (12.6%) and the scalp (26.6%).
Pit bulls (11.4%), Labrador retrievers (7.0%), and German shepherds (4.4%) were the most common offending breeds.
Most bites were superficial (91.1%).
Ten (6.3%) cases necessitated primary repair in the main operating room under general anesthesia.
More than half of patients were treated with prophylactic systemic antibiotics (55.1%).
Plastic surgery was the most common service involved (24.7%).
Seven (4.4%) patients developed an infection and there were no mortalities or long-term complications.
Rates of infection did not differ between patients who did or did not receive prophylactic systemic antibiotics (P = .
Regression analysis revealed no significant predictors of infection.

Conclusions
Most dog bites are superficial and involve the head and hands.
Infection rate is low, with no significant difference in infection rates between patients treated with or without prophylactic antibiotics.


Results
The mean age was 36 years, with a range of 18 to 81 years.


Results
Two-hundred fifteen (49%) surgeons responded, with a mean age of 51.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 11.5); 78% were male.
Thirty-three percent had been in practice for 25 years or longer.
More than half of respondents were practicing in a large urban center.
Fifty-nine percent believed their group was going to hire in the next 2 to 3 years; however, only 36% believed their health authority/provincial government had the necessary resources.
The mean desired age of retirement was 67 years (SD = 6.4).
We predict the surgeons-to-population ratio to be 1.55:100 000 and the graduate-to-retiree ratio to be 2.16:1 within the next 5 to 10 years.
Seventy-seven (49%) residents responded.
Most were "very satisfied" with their training (61%) and operative experience (90%).
Eighty-nine percent of respondents planned to pursue addqitional training after residency, with 70% stating that the current job market was contributing to their decision.
Most residents responded that they were concerned with the current job market.

Conclusions
Furthermore, there is an evident shortage of those practicing in rural areas.
Many trainees worry about the availability of jobs, despite evidence of active recruitment.
It may also benefit from a coordinated national approach to recruitment and succession planning.

Findings
In primary-care centres, 6012 patients with diabetes mellitus were identified and 5632 patients were referred for diabetic retinopathy screening.
A further 4036 patients directly attended two secondary-level hospitals and 2181 attended the tertiary-level hospital for screening.
A total of 2922 patients (24.7%) were found to have diabetic retinopathy and 923 (31.6%) were treated: 508 with laser photocoagulation, 345 with intravitreal bevacizumab and 70 with vitreoretinal surgery.

Conclusion
This requires the integration of professionals at all levels and all relevant specialties.


Methods
We searched online databases (CINAHL, Embase®, ERIC, MEDLINE®, ProQuest, PubMed® and Web of ScienceTM) for articles published between January 2000 and May 2018.
We considered studies to be ineligible if no follow-up data were reported.

Findings
Of 24 559 publications screened, 48 articles from 13 countries met the inclusion criteria.


Approach
From 2005, the programme reoriented to undertake concerted workforce and infrastructure development.
In 2008 full-time surgical services started in a purpose-built facility in the capital city.


Methods
In a multicentre, prospective study, we recruited 2185 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis from sites in Indonesia, Peru, Romania and South Africa from January 2014 to September 2016.

Findings
The overall crude prevalence of diabetes mellitus among newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients was 283/2185 (13.0%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 11.6-14.4).
There was substantial heterogeneity between sites for all markers, but the two-step combination test performed well in Indonesia and Peru.


Methods
We used the database acquired during the multistage, clustered, population-based survey, in which 15 377 participants completed questionnaires and provided dried blood spot samples for HIV testing.
We extracted sociodemographic and geographic data including age, sex, ethnicity, education, wealth, marital status and region for each participant.


Methods
We assessed incremental financial costs for programme implementation and verification, consumables and supervision.
We evaluated coverage and quality effectiveness of maternal and child health services before and after the trial, using data from household and facility surveys, and converted these to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.

Findings
The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 809 United States dollars (US$) and US$ 413 per QALY gained, respectively.


Methods
We measured height and weight and calculated BMI-for-age using WHO standards.
We measured body fatness using the deuterium dilution method and defined excessive body fat percentage as > 25% in boys and > 30% in girls.

Findings
The sensitivity of BMI z-score > +2.00 SD was low (29.7%, 95% CI: 25.5 to 34.2) and specificity was high (99.7%, 95% CI: 99.2 to 99.9).


Introduction
Free Open Access Medical Education encompasses a broad array of free online resources and discussion fora.

Conclusion
Lack of internet and device access was not a barrier to use in this group.


Introduction
Ultrasound is a technique that can be utilised to augment procedures to increase their safety and efficacy, but requires that health professionals be trained to use this imaging modality before it can be implemented.
With the extremely high cost of manufactured phantoms, homemade alternatives are popular substitutes.
Gelatine is commonly used as a matrix to suspend analogues and mimic tissue, but other substrates like ground meat can also be used.
Both of these substrates require refrigeration and are subject to spoiling.


Discussion
This case demonstrates the potential benefits of training these providers in POCUS.


Introduction
The establishment of poisons centres was subsequently identified as a priority.


Conclusion
Due to paucity of research on this topic, our understanding of blood donor behaviour in SSA is limited.
Local traditions and cultures intimately shape individuals' proclivity towards the donation process.


Introduction
Emergency Medicine (EM) residency programmes are new to Africa and exist in only a handful of countries.

Conclusion
However, there is also a demand from these graduates for educational materials, especially online.


Methods
Systematic literature review of 43,109 published reports on general emergency care from 139 LMICs.
Studies describing care for subsets of emergency conditions, subsets of populations, and data aggregated across multiple facilities were excluded.
All facility- and patient-level statistics reported in these studies were recorded and the most commonly used metrics were identified.

Results
We identified 195 studies on emergency care delivery in LMICs.
There was little uniformity in either patient- or facility-level metrics reported.
Patient demographics were inconsistently reported: only 33% noted average age and 63% the gender breakdown.
The upper age boundary used for paediatric data varied widely, from 5 to 20 years of age.
Emergency centre capacity was reported using a variety of metrics including annual patient volume (n = 175, 90%); bed count (n = 60, 31%), number of rooms (n = 48, 25%); frequently none of these metrics were reported (n = 16, 8%).
Many characteristics essential to describe capabilities and performance of emergency care were not reported, including use and type of triage; level of provider training; admission rate; time to evaluation; and length of EC stay.


Results
All participants passed a standardised exam requiring image acquisition and interpretation.


Methods
Trainees were recruited in district hospitals for participation in three all-day workshops held every 3-5 months from September 2013 through November 2014.
This was followed by an observed assessment of scanning image quality (IM) and diagnostic interpretation (IN).

Results
Eighty-one trainees enrolled in four initial training sessions and 30 attended at least one refresher session.


Introduction
Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergencies treated by the general surgeon.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Alvarado score combined with ultrasounds of the abdomen and pelvis in cases of right iliac fossa pain with suspected acute appendicitis.

Methods
100 patients admitted to the Department of Surgery at Alexandria Main University Hospital in 2013 complaining of right iliac fossa pain with suspected acute appendicitis were studied prospectively.


Introduction
Oesophageal trauma carries high mortality and morbidity.

Discussion
Non-operative management of intrathoracic oesophageal perforation is controversial.


Introduction
Traumatic spinal cord injuries can have catastrophic physical, psychological, and social consequences, particularly in low resource settings.
The objectives of this study are to describe the demographics, injury characteristics, and management of traumatic spinal cord injury victims presenting to the Adult Emergency Centre of Tikur Anbessa Specialised Hospital in Addis Ababa, the tertiary referral centre for emergency care in Ethiopia.

Results
Eighty-four patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries were identified.
The mean age was 33 years and 86% were male.
The most common mechanisms of injury were motor vehicle collisions (37%), falls (31%), and farming injuries (11%).
The cervical spine (48%) was the most commonly injured region and 41% were complete spinal cord injuries.


Introduction
The consequences of spinal injury as a result of trauma can be devastating.
Recently, adverse events due to the method of immobilisation have challenged the need for motion restriction in all trauma patients.
International guidelines have been published for protection of the spine during transport and this article brings those guidelines into the South African context.

Recommendations
They should then be managed accordingly.
Internationally validated assessment strategies have been developed, and should be used as part of the patient assessment.
The method of motion restriction should be selected to suit the situation.
The use of a vacuum mattress is the preferable technique, with the use of a trauma board being the least desirable.


Introduction
Emergency care research in Africa is not on par with other world regions.

Results
One hundred and sixty-eight responses were analysed (invited n = 540, responded n = 188, 34.8%, excluded n = 20).
Responders' mean age was 36.3 years (SD = 9.1); 122 (72.6%) were male, 104 (61.9%) were doctors, and 127 (75.6%) were African trained.
Thirty-seven (22%) have never been involved in research; 33 (19.6%) have been involved in ⩾5 research projects.
African related projects were mostly relevant to African audiences (n = 106, 63.1%).
Ninety-four (56%) participants have never published.
Forty-one (24.4%) were not willing to publish in open access journals requesting a publication fee; 65 (38.7%) will consider open access journals if fees are sponsored.
Eighty responders (47.6%) frequently experienced access block to original articles due to subscription charges.
Lack of research funding (n = 108, 64.3%), lack of research training (n = 86, 51.2%), and lack of allocated research time (n = 76, 45.2%) were the main barriers to research involvement.
Improvement of research skills (n = 118, 70.2%) and having research published (n = 117, 69.6%) were the top motivational factors selected.
Responders agreed that research promotes critical thinking (n = 137, 81.5%) and serve as an important educational tool (n = 134, 80.4%).
However, 134 (79.8%) feel that emergency care workers need to be shown how to use research to improve clinical practice.
Most agreed that insufficient emergency care research is being conducted in Africa (n = 113, 67.3%).


Results
A total of 530 patient care records were included (n = 530).
Single doses were administered to 268 (72.2%, 95% CI 67-77) morphine administrations, five (56%, 95% CI 21-86) ketamine administrations and 161 (82%, 95% CI 76-87) of nitrate administrations.
Chest pain was the reason for pain management in 226 (43%) cases.
Advanced Life Support Providers had a median experience level of two years (IQR 2-4).

Discussion
Multimodal analgesia is not a feature of care in this pre-hospital service.
The development of a Clinical Practice Guideline for and training in pre-hospital pain should be viewed as imperative.


Introduction
The epidemiology of these injuries, especially in the WHO-defined African Region, has yet to be adequately defined.

Results
The search resulted in 12,568 potential abstracts.


Methods
The times from arrival to triage and medical assessment were recorded and compared for each triage category.
We also assessed the inter-rater reliability of the process.

Results
111 patients were included during the study period.
In terms of acuity, 6% were categorised as red, 27% were orange, 20% yellow and 47% green.
Median time from triage to assessment was 15 min for red patients, 20 min for orange, 40 min for yellow and 72 min for green.


Results
Data indicated that most patients were young adult trauma victims with a dominant injury mechanism of vehicle-related accidents.
The majority of cases utilised ketamine and suxamethonium, with a low rate of additional paralytic medication administration.
63% and 72% of patients received post-intubation sedation and analgesia, respectively.
The overall intubation success rate from complete records was 99.6%, with a first pass success rate of 87.9%.
Students were successful in 92.4% of attempts with a first-pass success rate of 85.2%.
Five percent of patients experienced cardiac arrest between rapid sequence intubation and hospital arrival.

Discussion
Students demonstrated a good intubation success and first pass-success rate.


Introduction
With the widespread availability of a vast number of chemicals and drugs, acute poisoning is a common medical emergency worldwide.
In spite of the success of interventions to prevent toxic ingestions, acute poisoning continues to be an important public health problem.

Discussion
Young females comprise a group at increased risk for suicidal poisonings.


Results
A standardised survey was conducted with 64 participants working in emergency medicine [30/64 (46.9%)] and orthopaedics [34/64 (53.1%)].
Twenty-three of 64 (35.9%) respondents had received formal training.
Knowledge was acquired from didactic/workshop format for 15/23 (65.2%), followed by peer training 6/23 (39.1%).
The majority, 62/64 (96.9%), believed that knowledge of general anatomy and nerve blocks are very important.
Thirty-one of 64 (48%) of the respondents did not routinely perform peripheral nerve blocks.
A majority, 27/31 (87.1%) stated they lacked the required skills.
Ultrasound guidance of the femoral nerve 16/33 (48.5%) was the most commonly performed peripheral nerve block, followed by ankle block using anatomic landmarks 15/33 (45.5%).
A majority of the respondents (93.8%) (n = 60) were optimistic that their practice on peripheral nerve blocks would increase in future.
A highly significant association was found between previous training on peripheral nerve blocks and the number of peripheral nerve blocks performed in a month; p value - 0.006.

Discussion
This study indicates peripheral nerve blocks are likely underutilised due to lack of training.


Discussion
Initial management of chylothorax is conservative with tube thoracostomy drainage and fat free diet.


AIMS
Autism is a global and early developmental disorder that appears before the age 3 years old.


RESULTS
During the study period, 21,400 patients were admitted to the ER, of whom 445 patients were victims of traumatism, a frequency of 2.08% of all outpatient visits in the ER.
The male gender was predominant with 77.08% of the cases with a sex ratio of 3.36.
Mine landslides were the most common causality in 65.39% of the cases.
Dorsal spine involvement was the most common with 41.80% of cases.
Medullary vertebral fracture was the most frequent diagnosis with 43.82% of cases.
In total, 79.55% of patients received medical treatment.

CONCLUSION
Traumatism during traditional gold panning is common.
Lesions most often fit in a context of polytraumatism.
The rapidity of the diagnosis and management are crucial to the prognosis of the disease.


RESULTS
The average age of our patients was 32.00 years with extremes of 18 and 40 years old.

CONCLUSION
Pelvic surgery results in urological injuries.
Caesarean section and hysterectomy are contributing factors.
Vesico-vaginal fistula or ureteral lesions are common.


RESULTS
During the study period, 2,699 children were treated in pediatric surgery, of which 150 cases of pathology of the peritoneal-vaginal canal had a hospital frequency of 5.5%.
The average age was 3.25 ± 9.63 years.
The sex ratio was 14.
The reason for consultation was intermittent or permanent inguinal or inguino-scrotal swelling in all children.
The pathology was discovered by the parents during the pushing efforts in 46.7%.
Inguino-scrotal swelling was found on physical examination in 40% of cases.
The right side was reached in 60% of the cases.
Hernia accounted for 80.6% of these pathologies.
We recorded 31 cases of strangulation and 11 cases of craze.
Immediate operative follow-up was simple in 92% of patients.
This rate was 96% after 6 months.

CONCLUSION
The first place of these pathologies is occupied by hernia.
They preferentially affect male infants.


RESULTS
Over a 10-year period, 52 cases of patients diagnosed with amoebic liver abscess were collected in the department.
There were 41 men and 11 women, with a sex ratio of 3.7.
The mean age was 37.8 years old with extremes of 15 and 66 years.
The average outpatient visit delay time was 18.5 days with the extremes of 5 and 34 days.
The most frequent clinical signs were pain in the right hypochondrium (86.5%), fever (78.8%) and hepatomegaly (61.5%).
The average volume of the abscess was 366.5 cm3 with the extremes of 36 cm3 and 1580 cm3.
Amoebic serology was positive in 38 patients (80.9%).
Cytobacteriological analysis of pus in 37 patients (71%) was negative.

CONCLUSION
Amoebic liver abscess is an uncommon pathology in a surgical setting.
Abdominal ultrasound andechography guided liver puncture allowed the diagnosis.
Laparoscopic approach minimizes the burden of the laparotomy.


RESULTS
We identified 42 cases of monoclonal gammopathiesincluding multiple myeloma (n=40) and monoclonal gammopathy of underdetermined significance (n=2).
Three cases were treated by hemodialysis.
There were 6 (14.3%) deaths among patients with renal impairment.


MATERIEL AND METHODS
We conducted a nested cross sectional and cohort study in May 2011 on volunteers aged three months old to 25 years old.
Blood smear (blood), Kato-Katz (Stools) and urine filtration techniques were used to evaluate parasite prevalence.
Informed consent and assentment were obtained from the volunteers before their inclusion.
All volunteers received treatment against the parasite diseases of interest according to the guidelines of national disease control programs.

RESULTS
A total of 688 volunteers were included.
The prevalence rate of the co-infection Plasmodium falciparum - Schistosoma haematobium was 2.18% [95% CI= 2.17 - 2.19] in Kalifabougou.


METHODS
We carried out a cross-sectional study in 2016.
Compliance with the norms of the procurement and distribution of the products was appreciated.

RESULTS
Three workers of the CAME and 76 of health programs were surveyed.
According to the norms, malfunctioning impaired the system of the procurement, storage and the distribution of the products.


RESULTS
A total of 138,319 pregnant women participated in the annual HIV surveys from 2006 to 2015.
The national prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women between 2006 and 2015 was 2%.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Each patient was evaluated before and six weeks after the surgery.
We used the IPSS as an assessment tool, supplemented by the Quality of Life (SQ) questionnaire.

RESULTS
One hundred and thirteen (113) patients aged 71 ± 8 years old on average were evaluated.
The mean duration of symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia was 19 months and 17% of patients had a mechanical complication.


RESULTS
A total of 1,312 adolescents were hospitalized during the study period, an hospitalization rate of 7.21%.
The mean age was 15.52 ± 3 years with a sex ratio of 0.63.
The services most frequently used were gynecology obstetrics (30.87%), surgery (29.72%) and pediatrics (24.16%).
Disease states were dominated by the pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (24.08%), follow-up of traumatic lesions (19.43%), infectious and parasitic diseases (16.61%).
Traumatic ailments were predominant in boys and were mainly due to road accidents (12.73%) and falling from trees.


Results
Youth most frequently identified financial problems as likely to impact treatment.
Cumulative number of social determinants of health problems and individual domains of social determinants of health problems were related to overall mental health and addiction concerns.


Results
Thirteen children participated; four had ≥12,000 steps/day and nine had <12,000 steps/day.
The active group had a lower total tic severity (p = 0.02), and total YGTSS score (p=0.01).
The vocal tic severity score was lower in the active group (p=0.02).
Motor tic severity was not different amongst the two groups.

Conclusions
Higher physical activity levels are associated with lower vocal tic severity and improved aspects of quality of life.
Further research is needed to determine the utility of physical activity as therapy for tics.


Background
This innovative educational intervention may improve paediatric mental health care capacity, but a pilot study is needed.

Methods
We designed a cluster randomized, controlled pilot of PTCAP.
Random assignment to intervention or control (treatment-as-usual) will occur at the practice level.
Mental health care capacity at one-week post-intervention will be the primary outcome, assessed through self-report questionnaires of mental health care confidence, and through a more objective, observational assessment of trained skills.
We will also examine retention of these skills at one-month follow-up.
We expect use of trained common skills/elements to be associated with better child mental health outcomes on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (N = 250).


Results
The study sample consisted of 120 children, 41.5% male, average age 9.03 years (SD=2.2).
Fifty-percent were referred by Children's Mental Health Agencies (CMHA) and 31.7% by Emergency Departments.
The most frequent reason for referral was aggression (64.1%).
Most common diagnoses were externalizing disorders (76.7%).
Thirty-percent had an identified learning disorder, 80% were referred back to the community and 14.2% were referred to outpatient clinic.
There was a significant association between referral from an Emergency Department and female gender (p=0.048) and brief follow-up with CAMHUCC (p=0.006).


Objective
Social media use and especially Facebook use is highly prevalent among adolescents.


Background
Challenges associated with the use of the CanMEDS physician competency framework (CanMEDS) have been the subject of several studies.
Most of these have focused on the adoption of specific roles in an Anglophone context.


Methods
We measured residents' perception of the patient safety climate during implementation of night-float rotations in five tertiary hospitals.
First year residents came from most residency programs, second- and third-year residents came from internal medicine.

Results
One-hundred-and-thirty residents completed the questionnaire.


Problem
Identification Program.
A clinical obstetrician verified the coding.


Methods
We used publicly available data from the National Survey of Japanese Elderly, extracting a sample of 1288 men who were 60 years or older.
Survey respondents were followed-up for at most 15 years for the onset of four health outcomes: death, cognitive decline, stroke and diabetes.
By using the propensity score method, we adjusted for the healthy worker effect by incorporating economic, sociodemographic and health data in the form of independent variables.


RESULTS
More than half of the participants reported living with a low personal income (less than $50 000); females were particularly affected.
Low social participation was associated with obesity among older female participants, but not males.
Physical functioning issues and impairments in activities of daily living were strongly associated with obesity for both females and males.


RESULTS
Major fracture history was not associated with bone density testing or osteoporosis medication use.


OBJECTIVES
In fathers, depression symptoms experienced during pregnancy and after childbirth represent a depression risk factor during the child first months.
Until now, however, few studies have dealt with paternal depression and its determinants beyond the perinatal period.
