# WMT-Biomed-Test (fr-en)

This repository contains refactored versions of the testsets used in the Bio-Medical translation shared task for the years 
[2016](https://statmt.org/wmt16/biomedical-translation-task.html),
[2017](https://statmt.org/wmt17/biomedical-translation-task.html),
[2018](https://statmt.org/wmt18/biomedical-translation-task.html),
[2019](https://statmt.org/wmt19/biomedical-translation-task.html,
[2020](https://statmt.org/wmt20/biomedical-translation-task.html)
(French-English). The documents have been downloaded from the [main datasource](https://github.com/biomedical-translation-corpora/corpora), then realigned at the document and the sentence level so as to provide more suitable format for MT evaluations, which typically expect sentence-aligned source target pairs. 

Document Level tests are aligned test sets at the 'topic' level. One empty line indicates topic boundary and two empty lines are used to mark document boundaries.

Sentence level test sets are simpler sentence-aligned versions of test sets available in the Document Level test sets folder.
